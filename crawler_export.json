            "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had (https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27/asm-unanimously-approves- contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions-from- campus/)gathered(https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27/asm-unanimously- approves-contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions-from-campus/) last spring to consider a resolution(https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27 /asm-unanimously-approves-contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions- from-campus/) calling on the university to divest in companies and countries that abuse human rights, profit from the cmilitary-industrial complex and promote fossil fuels when the debate jumped the rails. , Soon, the students were in a full-scale battle over whether the resolution should cover Israel, with charges of anti-Semitism and racism rattling the room. A student representative who was Jewish said that the last-minute inclusion of Israel ccrossed the line from legitimate conversation to a point where I consider it malicious. The student government chairwoman, who is black, suggested the opposition to the resolution amounted to cwhite supremacy, which she condemned with a four-letter expletive. , In the aftermath, Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, decided to enter the fray, writing(http://brandeiscenter.com/ldb-urges-further-action-from-uw-madison/) to university administrators to denounce calls for divestment from Israel as anti-Semitic, and to assail the meeting as hostile toward Jewish students. He urged that the black student leader be disciplined. , On Thursday, Mr. Marcus received the approval of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to be President Trump 9s assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department, a prestigious post known more for policing racial bias and sexual violence in schools than refereeing the battles over Israel and Palestinian rights on the nation 9s university campuses. , Mr. Marcus 9s support for Jewish students has earned him praise in some quarters as an ardent defender of civil liberties with an acumen for the rule of law. On campus after campus, the B.D.S. movement 4 Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel 4 has driven a wedge between Jewish students and students of color, challenging university administrations and straining the traditional bonds between Jews and other minorities. And Mr. Marcus has not been shy in choosing sides. , Critics see him as a biased crusader whose singular focus on what he believes to be rising anti-Semitism on the campus left will further impede the Education Department 9s already tentative efforts to enforce civil rights protections for marginalized groups of students. ,  cWhat I find particularly troubling is he condemned a black woman on a predominantly white campus for pointing out my oppression, said Carmen Gosey, who was chairwoman of the Associated Students of Madison, the Wisconsin student government, at the time of the battle there last year. , His approach to the debate at the university cshows he doesn 9t understand racism, or he has an issue with black people talking about issues, or anyone who isn 9t Jewish talking about their issues, which seems very problematic for someone who is going to be in charge of civil rights, she said. , Ariela Rivkin, the Jewish student representative on the council, disagreed. She and other students felt targeted by Ms. Gosey 9s comments and believed she allowed the divestment legislation to be organized on the Jewish holiday of Passover, which they considered harassing and exclusionary. , Mr. Marcus 9s intervention cmeant everything to me, said Ms. Rivkin, who strongly backed Mr. Marcus 9s nomination to head the Education Department 9s civil rights office. cWhoever is in that role should be able to recognize that I have a right to express myself in a hostile-free environment. , For his part, Mr. Marcus, a career civil liberties lawyer, says he would show no bias in his approach to civil rights enforcement. During his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Marcus said he could cthink of no higher calling than to enforce the principles of equal justice and provide greater opportunities for students across this great country. , Mr. Marcus was delegated the authority of assistant secretary for civil rights for two years in the Bush administration where he reinforced protections for women and Jews as well as Muslims and Sikhs who faced religious discrimination in the wake of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. , If confirmed by the full Senate, Mr. Marcus would return to the high-profile office at a turbulent time. Issues of race, religion, sexual identity and freedom of speech are roiling elementary, secondary and higher education. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is under fire for Mr. Trump 9s attitudes toward and treatment of immigrants and minority groups, and her own re- examination of Obama-era rules(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos- colleges-sex-assault.html) to protect against sexual assault and race discrimination in special education placements is controversial. ,  cTo me, he is more dangerous than she is, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, one of the many human rights groups opposing Mr. Marcus 9s nomination. cHe is infinitely more effective. , Mr. Marcus served in both the housing and education departments under Mr. Bush and as staff director for the bipartisan United States Commission on Civil Rights, positions that his supporters say have afforded him the skills to combat the most intractable civil rights challenges. ,  cHe has a real good understanding about how all of our rights as Americans fit together, so he 9s not one-dimensional in any way, said Jennifer C. Braceras, a former member of the commission. , His critics question whether he will fulfill the office 9s goal to stand up for all students. More than 30 civil rights organizations wrote a letter (https://civilrights.org/oppose-confirmation-kenneth-marcus-assistant- secretary-civil-rights/)to the Senate Education Committee urging his rejection. , The groups cited Mr. Marcus 9s record of rejecting policies that address discrimination against minority groups, including affirmative action and the evidence that minority students are more likely to face tough disciplinary actions. The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund said Mr. Marcus was cunlikely to advance diversity and equal access to educational resources. , During his confirmation hearing last month(https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marcus1.pdf), Mr. Marcus said that he believed that if disproportionately high numbers of black students were being disciplined it would be grounds for concern, though it would not indicate outright discrimination or set off a systemic investigation. Ms. DeVos 9s administration has been criticized for taking a similar approach to all civil rights enforcement. ,  cMy experience says one needs to approach each complaint or compliance review with an open mind and sense of fairness to find out what the answers are, Mr. Marcus told the committee. cI have seen what appear to be inexcusable disparities that were result of paperwork errors. , The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights also questioned his support for Ms. DeVos 9s decision to rescind Obama-era guidance that strengthened processes for investigating sexual assault on college campuses. Ms. DeVos has expressed concern that the guidance has unfairly affected those accused of misconduct. , But Mr. Marcus has garnered support from conservative civil liberties groups that believe that he will rein in what they see as an overreach of civil rights enforcement during the Obama administration. , Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, said that under the Obama administration, affirmative action morphed into cracial preference. To extend legal protection to cover gender identity and sexual orientation, he said, is csimply not good law. ,  cThe civil rights laws say and mean something different than what was interpreted by the Obama administration, and I think that will change, Mr. Clegg said. cI think Ken is more in line with our interpretation of things. , Human rights groups also expressed concern that Mr. Marcus will use his office to further a more narrow agenda: combating the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement on college campuses, which he believes has devolved into violent, anti-Semitic harassment. , From his perch at the Brandeis Center, he has filed anti-Semitic harassment complaints with the Office for Civil Rights against three University of California college campuses, and encouraged Jewish students and their supporters to do the same. , Mr. Marcus wrote(http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Standing- up-for-Jewish-students-325648) in an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post that while the complaints were rejected, they had created public relations headaches for the institutions. ,  cIf a university shows a failure to treat initial complaints seriously, it hurts them with donors, faculty, political leaders and prospective students, Mr. Marcus wrote. , In its opposition, the Leadership Conference said that Mr. Marcus csought to use the Office of Civil Rights complaint process to chill a particular point of view, rather than address unlawful discrimination. , Mr. Marcus has lobbied for institutions and the Education Department to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism that Jewish activists embrace but that many Palestinian rights groups say would render criticism of Israel as hate speech. Mr. Marcus has also said that Middle East programs accused of an anti-Israel agenda should lose federal funding. ,  cHis primary mission is not to support students 9 civil rights; it 9s to protect Israel from criticism, said Rahul Saksena, an attorney with Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights group. , A group of 60 religious and educational organizations disagreed. They point to instances where Mr. Marcus has litigated First Amendment cases. ,  cWhile some believe that preventing discrimination in education and protecting the First Amendment are at odds, we could not disagree more. Both principles are paramount, wrote the group, which included Christian groups, Students and Parents Against Campus Anti-Semitism, and Stop BDS on Campus. , Mr. Marcus 9s support from conservative Christians extends beyond their broad backing of Israel. In 1998, Mr. Marcus spoke at a Traditional Values Coalition conference, where he criticized hate crimes legislation that would cover violence based on sexual orientation. He described the legislation as cgiving preferred treatment of some sorts of victims over other sorts of victims, and punishing people for cunpopular and ctraditionalist views. ,  cThere are people who are using the word 8hate 9 to denigrate some traditional moral values, Mr. Marcus told the group.(https://www.c-span.org/video/?103282-1/homosexuality-public-policy) , In response to more than 50 questions from Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Marcus said that his views expressed at the Traditional Values conference had cevolved.

            "article": " For the first time this Tuesday, the 70-member junior class of Chisholm High School in Enid, Okla., will sit for the SAT college entrance exam, but almost all the students will be clicking through Chromebooks instead of blackening bubbles with a No. 2 pencil. , One hundred fifteen miles east of Enid, the Tulsa, Okla., schools were also invited this year to administer an online version of the SAT, the exam that Tulsa 9s 1,700 juniors must take. The district chose paper and pencil. , Like Chisholm, Tulsa already gives all its end-of-year tests online. But this is the first year that SAT scores must be reported to the state for Oklahoma 9s school accountability report cards, and principals just did not want to risk an internet problem or power outage, explained Erin Lester, director of assessment. There are other challenges for this urban district, too, like how to give an online test to those likely to be in jail, juvenile detention or a mental health facility, a number that could range from dozens to more than 100 on testing day. ,  cSome of the jails don 9t even allow computers with internet accessibility, Ms. Lester said. cWe wanted to be equitable. , Long in the works, the digital transition by the two college testing companies is taking a few more cautious steps forward this year. But with 29 states, the District of Columbia and many of the largest cities giving the standardized exams to all juniors, the complexity of the task has never been greater. ,  **READ MORE** : Here 9s What You Need to Know About Online Testing for the ACT and SAT(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/tests- act-sat.html) , Out in front is ACT Inc.(https://www.act.org/), which began digital testing in 2015 and will move all its international testing online this fall 4 a year later than planned. ACT offers the digital option to all 16 states and 1,100 districts that contract with it, said Edward Colby, a spokesman. But just 8 percent of roughly one million school-day tests given last year were digital. ,  cThe challenges I often hear are about the entire state having enough laptops for every single junior and senior to take an assessment on the same day, said Angie McAllister, ACT senior vice president for research. cACT is responding to what our customers are asking us for, and today, they are still saying we want to do most of it on paper. , ACT 9s archrival, the College Board, are offering digital versions of the school-day SAT in Oklahoma and Ohio this month. Altogether, about 100 schools will take either the SAT or Preliminary SAT exams online, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman. But it, too, has had stumbles and resistance. ,  cWe will continue to work with educators to navigate the unique challenges of responsibly delivering digital assessments while safeguarding access and equity, Jeremy Singer, the chief operating officer, said in a statement. , Digital testing offers the potential for lower cost, instant results and more accurate scoring. Eliminating test booklets and answer sheets provides greater security from test theft, a serious concern after major cheating scandals in the United States and abroad. An increasing share of professional, licensing and postgraduate exams are digital-only, including the GRE, MCAT and GMAT. , Digital literacy in schools was a core goal of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which mandated annual testing of schoolchildren grades three through eight and in high school to hold schools accountable. The Common Core academic standards, released in 2010 and accepted by most states, called for state accountability tests to be administered online. , But developing an online version of a high-stakes standardized test requires exhaustive studies of such factors as laptop scrolling speeds, screen loading of various equipment and fine-grained statistical comparisons of scores, Ms. McAllister said. , Test administration poses its own challenges. In South Carolina last year, the first statewide mandatory online ACT exam was marred by technical difficulties, forcing some schools to administer makeup tests and delaying some score reports. Mr. Colby blamed a nationwide outage beyond ACT 9s control, but Ryan Brown, an Education Department spokesman, said the state encouraged districts to seek waivers for paper tests this year, and many did. ,  cFrankly, we don 9t trust ACT 9s capacity to test an entire state online, he said. , ACT adapted by requiring a new test setup this year. The approach, known as proctor caching, is in place in suburban Edmond, Okla., where 1,692 juniors are taking the ACT online for the first time at three high schools and an alternative academy. Each school has a dedicated server that downloads and administers the test to individual students 9 work stations, thus avoiding web-related problems. ,  cWe have not had one phone call from a parent concerned or questioning, said Angela Mills Grunewald, associate superintendent. cI think online testing is so much the norm that it 9s not a concern. , But Oklahoma City opted for the paper SAT this year, because the city does not yet have enough equipment and its older buildings are prone to power and network failures. The 2013 debut of Oklahoma 9s online statewide testing is remembered as a debacle. ,  cMany students already experience anxiety while taking exams such as the SAT, and disruptions in testing may further increase this anxiety for students, said Beth Harrison, chief communications officer for the Oklahoma City schools. , It 9s not just students who are anxious, said Thomas Tucker, superintendent of the Princeton City School District in Cincinnati, which plans to give the SAT online on Tuesday. ,  cWhen you change from one mode of test administration to another, scores typically drop 4 we know that for a fact, said Mr. Tucker, who serves on a College Board advisory panel. Adept as this generation is online, teenagers are most at ease using phones, not keyboards, he said. Though scores tend to rebound later, Mr. Tucker said many of his colleagues do not want even a temporary score drop on their watch. cThey don 9t want to bite the bullet, he said. , Closer study has shown that scores drop only among students who do not use computers for everyday schoolwork, said Tracy Weeks, executive director of the State Educational Technology Directors Association. , The College Board and ACT emphasize the practice value of their online exams in earlier grades, as well as their free online test prep: The College Board promotes the score-boosting power of its partner Khan Academy, commonly used in school and after-school curriculums, while ACT this spring began its own ACT Academy online test prep. , Nevertheless, many students still feel more confident with pencil and paper. Bryce Kessler, a senior at Princeton High School, who hopes to study musical theater, said he took the online SAT at school last year but did better on the pencil-and paper Saturday ACT for which he had been practicing for years. ,  cIt was kind of disorienting to me, he said of the digital format. cI know a lot of people who did not finish or said they only got halfway. , At least one test coach, ArborBridge, is urging its clients to avoid online tests if they have the option, saying too little is known about the testing setup and interface. ,  cNo one wants to be a guinea pig, said Megan Stubbendeck, ArborBridge 9s senior director of instruction. , That prospect apparently does not faze the juniors in Enid. ,  cI personally am nervous, said Kassidy Diel, junior class secretary, who is aiming for Oklahoma State University and a career in veterinary medicine. But she admitted that is just her mind-set about tests. ,  cEverybody has taken at least one big test online, she said. cI think they know what to expect.  ",

            "article": "  **GREEN**  By Sam Graham-Felsen  301 pp. Random House. $27. ,  cGreen, the debut novel from Sam Graham-Felsen, who was chief blogger for Barack Obama 9s 2008 presidential campaign, chronicles the middle school travails of an anomalous variety of minority student. cI am the white boy at the Martin Luther King Middle, is how 12-year-old David Alexander Greenfeld, nicknamed Green, introduces himself in the novel 9s opening line. Martin Luther King Middle is a Boston public school 4 cmad ghetto, in Green 9s estimation 4 where his progressive parents have sent him for sixth grade. He 9s not the only white boy in the school, but the other one 4 his friend Kev, who 9s got lip scruff and spiky black hair along with prowess on the basketball court 4 often passes for Puerto Rican. There 9s no mistaking Green, though: not with his blue eyes and blond curls and constantly flushed cheeks, not with his monogrammed L. L. Bean backpack, not with his weakness for blurting the word cawesome ( ca Caucasian catastrophe, he notes). Almost all 12-year-olds are confused about who and what they are, but for David Greenfeld, at school, one conspicuous facet of his identity defines him: not his Green-ness, but his whiteness. , Hewing to the classic coming-of-age-novel formula, cGreen 9s Green experiences a variety of awakenings 4 sexual, religious, familial, moral and not surprisingly racial 4 during the course of his sixth-grade school year (1992-93), all of which get relayed in first-person, present- tense, slanged-up narration. The alarm clock for some of these awakenings is the friendship Green strikes with Marlon Wellings, a pious, studious black classmate who lives near Green in the Robert Gould Shaw Homes, a.k.a. cthe projects. Marlon, unlike Green, is mostly immune to social tensions, sitting by himself at lunchtime studying for the entrance exam to Boston Latin, the city 9s elite public school, where Green also aims to transfer. Green 9s first impression is that Marlon clooks pretty soft, and thus approachable: ccreased khakis, pilled-up flannel, boxy black shoes and a short, unkempt flattop, more like a clumpy cloud. He has a gap in his front teeth, just as Green does, but the similarities don 9t end there. The bond they form is based partly upon a clandestine love for the Boston Celtics 4 cno one openly admits they feel the Celtics anymore, Green says 4 and partly upon their shared desire for an upward move to Boston Latin. At Martin Luther King Middle they 9re outsiders, and both of them are desperate to get even farther outside. , The similarities do, however, bear some obvious endpoints. Green 9s Birkenstock-shod parents went to Harvard before embarking on a life of bobo activism ( cPops gives mad loot to Greenpeace d); Marlon 9s father is somewhere down South while his grandmother cares for him along with his mentally ill mother. Green and his 8-year-old brother, Benno, spend summers helping their parents tend a community garden plot; Marlon eats asparagus for the first time at Green 9s house and the resultant urine smell triggers a cancer panic. Green is a secular Jew, confounded by what that even means, while Marlon sings in the choir in a storefront church near the Roxbury border. Green 9s parents, if they would relax their principles, could conceivably send him to a safer private school (brother Benno, who recently stopped speaking, attends one such school cfor sensitive kids d); Marlon 9s grandmother is absent that option. And Marlon is black, while Green, glaringly, is white. , This dynamic 4 the white boy adrift in the urban and predominantly black school, the fraught cross-racial friendship that blooms there 4 isn 9t new to fiction. Jonathan Lethem probed it, with exquisite grace, in his 2003 novel cThe Fortress of Solitude. (A line from Lethem 9s novel, in fact, could serve as a 10-word summary of Green: cA white boy in sixth grade, squirming in the glare. d) Graham-Felsen isn 9t reaching for the same lofty heights as Lethem did (few novelists dare to), but he is reaching in the same general direction: toward the terribly thorny beauty at the heart of cross-racial friendships, which constitutes, per Leslie Fiedler and others, one of our essential American stories. These thorns keep getting denser and sharper as cGreen progresses, as when Green discovers that the pair 9s snow shoveling business is successful only when he approaches potential customers without Marlon in sight. What we call racism Green apprehends as cthe force d: its energies everywhere, cworking on everyone, himself included. When Green copies a couple of answers from Marlon during the fated entrance exam, the white proctor takes notice but lets it slide. cA sickening mix of relief and shame sweeps over me, says Green. cMar knows it and I do, too: I 9ve been saved by the force. , Moments like these 4 rendered subtly, without poster-size messaging 4 are when cGreen is at its most prickly and compelling. Scenes of innocence 4 Green and Marlon clowning in homemade pro-wrestler costumes, or watching VHS tapes of Larry Bird-era Celtics games from inside a living room fort made of blankets and chairs 4 serve as their delicately calibrated counterbalances, affecting in their sweetness but credible in their lack of saccharine. Graham-Felsen lets boys be boys: messy-brained, impulsive, goatish, self-centered, outwardly gutsy but often inwardly terrified. The voice with which Graham-Felsen equips Green, overseasoned with hip-hop slang, is the epitome of this. At first blush it suggests Holden Caulfield as translated by Vanilla Ice ( cIf I 9m gonna make another attempt to kick it to her, I 9m gonna need a new Machine, and for that I 9m gonna need to fatten my muenster stack, fast d). Yet as the novel advances, and this street stud pose starts splintering, the voice itself gathers a kind of dorky poignancy, the reader sensing an unseen wobble upon Green 9s stiff, pale lip. Is it linguistic blackface, with all that implies, or a 12-year- old 9s guileless attempt to cobble together a voice of his own from what 9s nearest at hand? cI wish I had what he has, Green says of Marlon at one point. He 9s talking about religion, but it could be identity or maybe identity 9s midwife, community. cAll I came up with was confusion. , Yet this reader found himself wishing for something of Marlon 9s, too: _his_ awakenings, _his_ perspective, _his_ inner voice, _his_ fullness on the page. As Lethem wrote in cThe Fortress of Solitude d: cThe white kid has one set of feelings, the black kid another. That we aren 9t privy to those feelings owes less to malpractice than to the inherent limitations of Graham-Felsen telling this story through Green 9s blue eyes. Marlon only exists within Green 9s purview, which means that cGreen 4 and by extension the reader 4 sees only a fraction of the whole. cWe match up in a million soft little ways 4 why can 9t we just be boys again? Green laments near the end, when the friendship has run aground. cBut the more I think about it, the more I wonder if we were meant to be shards from the start. Not just me and Mar 4 everyone. Look around. \\u2026 The force is everywhere, prying us apart. There 9s more hopefulness than this by the final pages, but it 9s a long-shot hope, a coin into a fountain. He and Marlon match up in a million ways save one, but that one, in America then as now, seems cursed to outweigh all the others.  ",

            "article": " When Garett A. Holm began his first day of law school in Tucson he wasn 9t especially concerned that people would ask his age, which was 41. , But he was braced for the possibility that someone might ask which admissions test he had taken 4 the traditional one law schools have used for more than half a century, or the test taken by students applying to almost all other graduate programs. , Why that matters speaks to an upheaval of sorts going on at most law schools around the country, which have faced plummeting enrollment for several years. Although they are beginning to recover, the fallow period led them to explore ways to find new pools of potential students. , One of the solutions, many decided, was to make a change in admission requirements. They would no longer rely solely on the Law School Admission Test, or LSAT, which has been considered the surest predictor of how a student will fare in coursework. As an alternative, they would consider performance on the Graduate Record Exam. Accepting it could allow many more students to get into law school, proponents of the change said. , One test versus another might seem like a less than radical reason for debate. , But some defenders of the traditional test say the change amounts to a dangerous lowering of standards and could allow too many students to enroll in law school who would be unable to pass the lawyer licensing exam. , Many deans, however, want to rid themselves of some constraints on their admissions policies. They seek more flexibility to admit candidates they think are promising but who do not necessarily fit a conventional profile. , A showdown of sorts is set for later this month when the American Bar Association 9s accrediting body plans to hold a public hearing where both sides can air their views. , The University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, in Tucson, where Mr. Holm is a student, was a leader in moving beyond the LSAT requirement. In 2016, the school said it would allow applicants to present results of the GRE, which is taken around the world by about six times more students than the 126,000 or so who take the LSAT annually. , Test scores are combined with other measures, including grade-point average, to admit students for the three-year juris doctoral degree. , Some schools value the LSAT 9s record of predictability and will keep the test, but many law schools care looking to innovate and experiment, said Christopher P. Chapman, president and chief executive of AccessLex Institute(https://www.accesslex.org/management-team), the nonprofit organization representing most of the more than 200 accredited law schools. , Supporters of the LSAT, administered since 1948, say they believe it already allows law schools to take into account a broad spectrum of education and experiences in deciding who can study to become a lawyer. ,  cIt provides a common measure for all applicants, said Christina B. Whitman, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and chairman of the board of trustees of the Law School Admissions Council(https://www.lsac.org/), which oversees the LSAT. cHow else could admissions directors evaluate students, like me, who attended massive state universities, she said. . , Nearly 20 law schools, including Harvard 9s, have embraced the GRE as an alternative. More than 150 law school deans, including those from many elite schools that had no shortage of applicants, vigorously backed Arizona 9s effort two years ago to introduce the alternative. , In March, the Education Testing Service, the Princeton, N.J., organization that administers the GRE and other standardized tests, unveiled a tool to help schools compare the results of the GRE and the LSAT. , Supporters of the GRE say fewer restrictions will make law school more readily available to people of more varied backgrounds as well as more races, ethnicities and income levels to offset the small percentages of minorities in law school. Black and African Americans make up only about 8.5 percent of law students; Asians and Hispanics make up an additional 20 percent of law students in 2017. , Arizona has admitted students with academic backgrounds in disciplines like math, engineering and science who had not typically considered law school as an educational path. , Many are older than their early to mid-20s, which was once a more traditional age to enter law school, and already have graduate degrees and skills from previous careers. ,  cA number of them are people in mid-careers, with families, looking for a career change, said Marc L. Miller, the school 9s dean. cHalf or more are making a career shift, from disciplines like accounting or careers in the military, he said, adding, cWe have a Ph.D. chemist, a geneticist and a doctoral student in rhetoric. , Students with such academic backgrounds often test well on the LSAT, where scores of 160 or higher are generally considered desirable for law school admissions. But they frequently choose the GRE because it can be used to apply to graduate and business schools as well as some law schools. , So far, Arizona has enrolled 25 students 4 12 in the first year and 13 in the second year 4 who applied on the basis of their GRE scores. It is too early to tell how they will fare because the first group of students will not take their state licensing exams until next year 4 after they receive their degrees. , Mr. Miller said the students care randomly distributed around the classes, which have around 80 people each, and their performance is well within what we normally see. , In the first group, he said, many seemed to avoid saying they had taken only the GRE. cBut by the second class, no one was the least bit worried to say so. , Mr. Holm, who has been a teacher, nonprofit executive and a budget official, said he was never asked about what test he took. ,  cIt was hard enough being the first, recalled Mr. Holm, about his early law student days, cbut I was mindful that there was a stigma that someone might not be qualified enough.

Consider women and college graduates, who have flocked to the Democratic Party in recent years. , A larger share of college graduates identify as or lean Democratic than at any point in the past quarter-century, according to a new Pew Research Center report(http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing- educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/) based on more than 10,000 interviews with registered voters last year. The data tell a similar story for women, too. , Republicans have gained some ground, too, among older registered voters and those with a high school education or less. , Here 9s a brief look at the findings of the Pew analysis, which was released this week. , Americans are more divided along educational lines than at any point in about a quarter-century, according to Pew. , That 9s thanks largely to a realignment among two groups: those with only a high school diploma and those who have completed college. , In 1992, 55 percent of registered voters with no more than a high school education identified or leaned toward the Democratic Party, while only 37 percent sided with Republicans. Today, the group shows a slight preference for the Republican Party. , The exact opposite is true for Americans with at least a college degree, whose slight preference for Republicans in 1992 has since flipped. Today, about 58 percent side with Democrats, and only 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party. , That divergence was most pronounced among registered voters who had pursued a postgraduate education: Once split in their political preferences, they are now twice as likely to align with Democrats as with Republicans. , Women have long been more likely to side with the Democratic Party than with Republicans, but the gap in preference expanded in recent years, to 19 percentage points in 2017 from 12 points in 2015. , Most of that growth, however, comes not from women who now identify as Democrats, but those who find themselves leaning toward the party, according to Pew. , And the gap is widest among millennial women, who are three times as likely to identify or lean Democratic as Republican: In 2017, 70 percent of millennial women sided with Democrats, while just 23 percent preferred Republicans. , That gap is more than two times as large as it was in 2014. , But not all women have moved toward the Democrats. Support for Republicans has steadily risen among women in the Silent Generation, defined by Pew as those born from 1928 to 1945. Today, 48 percent of those women side with Republicans, while 46 percent align with Democrats.  ",

In response to new rules requiring businesses to publish pay figures, a number claimed to have 50% male and 50% female staff. The government said this was \"statistically improbable\" and called on firms to check their information. The Fawcett Society called for a clampdown on potential \"fake data\". Companies with 250 or more workers will have to calculate their gender pay gap and publish it on a government website.    About 9,000 employers have to publish their data by 4 April 2018, or 30 March for the public sector. So far about 750, including the BBC, have done so(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42580194). Two dozen companies say they have a gender pay gap of zero, with 10 of them claiming that precisely 50% of lower, middle, upper and higher wage earners are female and 50% are male.

It's possible that we are looking at fake data in some cases. \"The government needs to act urgently and give the Equality and Human Rights Commission the power and resources to effectively crack down on businesses who don't comply with the law.\" Anthony Horrigan, from workforce analytics company Staffmetrix, said: \"Companies with modern data-collection processes will find this easier. Some companies will have some of their data, such as the payroll, on one system and other data on different systems. However, everyone has to get on and do this.\" A Government Equalities Office spokesman said the department would be following up with employers where \"statistically improbable data has been reported\" to help them get it right. He added: \"Employers have until 4 April 2018, or 30 March 2018 for the public sector, to report their gender pay gap. They must also ensure that the information they publish is accurate. This is not an option, it is the law, so they need to get on and do it. \"Any evidence that employers are breaching the law can be investigated and they risk being subject to enforcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.\" The employer to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% gap between male and female staff.   Phase Eight said the figure did not reflect the \"true story\" of the business as most male employees are in higher-paid head office roles rather than in shops. The pay gap is calculated based on the difference in the mean hourly rate earned by male and female staff.   ",

            "article": "  Education protects white women from losing their babies in infancy. The more education they have, the lower the infant mortality rate. Strangely, though, it 9s the opposite for black women. The most educated face the greatest risk of having their children die at birth or in infancy. Stress from dealing with racism and sexism seems to be a key reason that highly educated black women are far more likely lose their babies than are equally educated white women, says Keisha\\xa0Bentley-Edwards, a co-author of a new report, which is titled cFighting at Birth: Eradicating the Black- White Infant Mortality Gap. The stress can lead to premature delivery of low birth-weight babies. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWAXZozJqUpQ/v0/60x-1.png) Duke University, Insight Center for Community Economic Development  cWhen you 9re the only black woman in the room, when you 9re often working in\\xa0elite circles where you are the first or you are the only, there is a toll to be paid, says Bentley-Edwards. Herself a\\xa0black woman with a doctorate, she is a professor of general internal medicine at Duke University, as well as associate research director at Duke 9s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity. The research was done in concert with the\\xa0Insight Center for Community Economic Development in Oakland, Calif.     The findings of cFighting at Birth aren 9t entirely new. Researchers have known for decades that black mothers 9\\xa0infant mortality rate is about twice that of white women, and that black women don 9t get the same protection from education and higher socioeconomic status that white women do. Even many black women who have attained high rank carry the legacy of a lifetime of struggle. Damage to the body from stress, known as cweathering, has wide-ranging health effects that may manifest themselves during pregnancy.     Bentley-Edwards says the report makes two contributions. It puts all the research together in what she calls a\\xa0 cdigestible form. And it advocates for solutions that the medical establishment has resisted. Bentley- Edwards says doctors and public-health officials tend to focus their efforts on\\xa0poor women, regardless of their race. That 9s a worthy effort, but it does nothing for black women who aren 9t poor but nonetheless\\xa0are at grave risk of losing their newborn babies.  cThis is a push for a policy that 9s directed at black women specifically, she says. The extremely high rate of infant mortality for black women with doctorates or professional degrees raises the question of whether there 9s a fluke in\\xa0the data. After all, there are relatively few black women with advanced degrees that give\\xa0birth in any given year, and far fewer whose babies die in infancy. But Bentley-Edwards says statistical tests confirmed the result. And even if the disparity is somewhat smaller on average than these numbers show, the overall problem has been repeatedly confirmed by other researchers. Bentley-Edwards says the report should not be taken as a message to black women to think twice about getting an advanced education. cWe have to attack the stressor, she says. cEliminate job discrimination. We need allies to step in when we see a black woman at work not being treated the way she should be. The woman shouldn 9t feel guilty that she 9s complicit. It 9s not the education that 9s doing it.     Infant mortality rates have fallen for all races over the decades, but the rate for black women overall has remained about twice that of white women overall. White American women have the same risk as women in New Zealand, while black American women have the same risk as women in Romania or Thailand. Black\\xa0American women are far more likely to give birth prematurely, which is a major risk factor for infant mortality. Differences remain, even after accounting for factors such as poverty, obesity, age of mother, and illegal drug use. A 2015 study(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-015-9687-2) in the _Annals of Behavioral Medicine_ by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Wisconsin, and Emory University looked at markers\\xa0of inflammation in the body and found that cthe health ramifications\\xa0of high anger, or poorly controlled anger, may be stronger\\xa0in African Americans with more, compared to less, education. Last year, the _International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ published an  article(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678200) by researchers at Tulane University and other institutions that included interviews with 18 black women who had lost their children in infancy. Some\\xa0said that they felt the medical establishment was insensitive to their loss. cI mean, we planned her. We wanted her, one said. Another said, cIt 9s like, 8No! We are human. We care about our well- being just like you do. 9 Even tennis star Serena Williams had problems\\xa0when she gave birth. In her case, the life in danger was hers, not her child 9s. She told _Vogue_ magazine(https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview- february-2018)\\xa0that when she insisted on a CT scan to check for blood clots, a nurse told her that her pain medicine might be confusing her. She insisted on the scan and was proven correct. cI was like, 8listen to Dr. Williams! 9 she said. ProPublica\\xa0and NPR News last year co-published a story(https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from- dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth) that likewise focused on the risk of childbirth to black women. According to the Centers for Disease Control, it said,\\xa0black mothers in the U.S. die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.  cFighting at Birth is more prescriptive about black infant mortality than most previous\\xa0studies. It recommends support for programs and advocacy groups for black mothers; protocols to minimize bias by health- care providers; enforcement of laws against discrimination against black women; increased social support for expectant black women; and encouragement of breastfeeding, among other fixes.\\xa0   ",

Many of the technologies in the film are invented or controlled by Shuri, the sister of T 9Challa, the Black Panther and Wakanda 9s king. Shuri, 16, plays a similar role to cQ from the James Bond films, providing her brother and the kingdom with vibranium-powered vehicles, weapons and other innovations. , In a statement, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, Robert A. Iger, said it was thrilling to see how much the technology in the film had excited young audiences. ,  cIt 9s fitting that we show our appreciation by helping advance STEM programs for youth, especially in underserved areas of the country, to give them the knowledge and tools to build the future they want, he said. , The $1 million pledged by Disney is only a fraction of the money that the film has brought in. In less than two weeks in theaters, cBlack Panther made more than $700 million worldwide(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/movies/black-panther-700 -million-globally-box-office.html), making it one of the fastest grossing films(https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/02/25/box-office- black-panther-tops-700m-with-record-breaking-2nd-weekend/618f2329213f) ever. , In a Twitter thread on Tuesday, the journalist Gene Demby, who writes and hosts a podcast about race for NPR, was dismissive of Disney 9s contribution, calling it(https://twitter.com/GeeDee215/status/968503958452035584) a crounding error. He wrote about how Disney has benefited from(https://twitter.com/GeeDee215/status/968497352863571968) enthusiasm about the merits of cBlack Panther and its representation of black people. , The Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a federated organization with independent clubs in cities around the country, said the money would be used to create new STEM innovation centers in 12 cities. (The acronym stands for science, technology, engineering and math.) Those cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Washington and Oakland, Calif., where the director of cBlack Panther, Ryan Coogler, was born and where some of the film takes place. , Chrissy Booth, the senior director of youth development programs for the organization, said the cities were target markets for Disney. The organization plans to evaluate critical need in those markets, as well as individual clubs 9 willingness to participate, before deciding which clubs in each city will receive the centers. , The organization 9s STEM curriculum gives young people the chance at an early age to have hands-on experiences, like building bridges and light bulbs and creating rock candy, Ms. Booth said. Children then move on to programs that focus on computer and environmental science and digital literacy. , The Boys & Girls Clubs worked with Partnerships in Education and Resilience, the education policy institute at Harvard University, and found that 12th graders in Boys and Girls Clubs were almost twice as likely than their peers to be interested in a STEM career. Fifty percent of girls who participated reported interest, compared with 12 percent of their peers nationwide. , Disney 9s donation imitates the end of the film (and in case it wasn 9t clear, **spoilers follow** ). Shuri and T 9Challa arrive in the United States, landing on a basketball court in Oakland. As a part of a new decree, T 9Challa places his sister in charge of global outreach around technology, giving underserved kids the chance to benefit from Wakanda 9s riches.  ",

            "article": " Our new Learning sections will feature a question-and-answer segment with an education expert. For our first installment, we 9ve chosen Sir Ken Robinson, a best-selling author and longtime advocate of transforming education. His latest book, cYou, Your Child, and School, was published in March by Viking. The following interview was edited and condensed. , **Your new book offers wide-ranging advice for parents as they try to manage their children 9s education. If you had to choose one takeaway, what would it be?** , Parents have more power and more choices than they may realize in educating their children. Many parents are worried about how the world is changing and the uncertain futures their children face. Parents are especially anxious about education. They worry that there 9s too much testing and competition, that the curriculum is too narrow, that their children are not treated as individuals and that schools are not cultivating their curiosity, confidence and creative talents. , They worry about how many young people are being medicated for clearning problems. They worry about the rising costs of college and whether their children will eventually find a job, whether or not they go to college. Often parents feel powerless to do anything about all of this. The good news is that a great many educators share these concerns and are also campaigning for change. , **While it 9s reasonable to lay heavy responsibility on parents for charting the path of their children 9s education, they are no match for the bureaucracy of any single school, let alone a state or federal Department of Education. How can parents expect to have any real impact?** , The challenges parents face and the options they have are naturally affected by their circumstances. Parents living in poor neighborhoods with limited resources face different challenges from those in wealthy suburbs with paid help. Some parents can pay for the education they want; most cannot. , In general, they have three options: They can work for changes within the current system, particularly in their children 9s own school; they can press for changes to the system; or they can educate their children outside the system. Whatever their circumstances, parents are not powerless and their voices must be heard. , **Is there one school system** **you think is doing things right? And if so, how?** , Governments everywhere are trying to improve education. For decades, the main strategies have been standardization, competition and incessant testing, especially in literacy, mathematics and science. It 9s been a partial success at best and in many ways a dismal failure. The story in Finland is different. , Finland is regularly at or near the top of international league tables in those disciplines but its success is much broader. Significantly, there is no mandated curriculum in Finland. Schools are encouraged to follow a broad curriculum that includes the arts, sciences, mathematics, languages, humanities and physical education. There is hardly any standardized testing. Finland invests heavily in the selection and training of teachers, and teaching is a high-status profession. , The Finnish system is not perfect and it 9s still evolving, but it 9s succeeding against a wide range of measures, where many other systems fall tragically short, and it 9s doing that by following a different path. , **You talk about the stress students are under these days. What 9s the best way for a parent to ease that stress, while still keeping their students competitive in a very tough and demanding global environment?** , In the United States, more than eight out of 10 teenagers experience extreme or moderate stress during the school year, including headaches, loss of sleep, anger and irritability. The main causes include anxieties about academic performance, the pressures of testing, and parental pressures to excel at school and get into a good college. , Many young people feel overscheduled with nearly every waking hour being assigned, plotted and planned with little time for just cbeing a kid. Parents can help in three ways: by learning to recognize the signs of ctoxic stress, by easing the pressures at home through encouraging more downtime and by working collectively with the school to reduce some of the avoidable causes of stress, including the often excessive levels of homework and testing. , **You have been critical** ** 4 as have many** ** 4 of standardized testing. If you could change it, how would you do it differently? End it altogether? Change the format? Do it less often? And if the last, how do you ensure that students are learning what they need to know?** , There was a time when school students could expect to take a few tests each year. Now they face a seemingly endless steeplechase of tests, sometimes starting in kindergarten. , High-stakes testing was meant to raise standards in education. Instead, it 9s generated a dreary culture of incessant competition, which has soaked up billions of taxpayer dollars with no significant improvement in standards, causing enormous stress for teachers, children and their families. Constructive assessment is an essential part of high-quality education, and some forms of diagnostic testing can be helpful. The usual forms of high stakes testing are neither constructive nor essential. , The proper purposes of assessment are to support and improve student learning and to provide an informative record of their achievements. There are many better ways to do this than through the barren rituals of bubble tests. , **What is your view of charter schools? Would you encourage or discourage their existence?** , Charter schools are independently operated public schools, which have freer rein than regular public schools in what they teach and how they are run. In themselves, they are neither better nor worse than ordinary public schools. Some are very successful, others less so. , One argument for charter schools is that they can invigorate the public sector by spreading new practices. Some do and some don 9t. Another is that they give parents more choice in education. The choice can be more apparent than real. All schools have limited spaces, and popular ones soon become oversubscribed. Either way, for most families, public schools are still their best opportunity in education. , **If you were the United States education secretary, what is the first thing you would do to change the American school system?** , What is education for? In my view, it is to enable all students to understand the world around them and the talents within them so that they can become fulfilled individuals and active, compassionate citizens. The proper role of government is to create the best conditions for that to happen. , If I were secretary, I would encourage all schools to adopt a broad and balanced curriculum including languages, math, the arts, sciences, humanities and physical education, and develop nonstatutory guidelines and resources to support them. I would roll back the current testing requirements in favor of more informative approaches to assessment. I would support the comprehensive development of early-years education. I would institute a csoup to nuts review of the selection, training and support of teachers. I would introduce incentives for creative partnerships between schools, families, cultural organizations and the private sector. , In these and other ways, education can and must change 4 for all our sakes.

That was the conclusion of a report from the Children's Commissioner,(https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/Growing-Up-North-March-2018-1.pdf) Anne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide?  There are varying levels of deprivation   There were higher proportions of children claiming free school meals(https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their- characteristics-january-2017) in the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017.    Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than \\xa37,400 a year excluding income from benefits.  * Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41983610) And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long- term, entrenched deprivation.  There are strong links between deprivation and how well children do at school The link between deprivation and how well children do at school(https://www.suttontrust.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/1Attainment_deprived_schools_summary.pdf) has been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a \"double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school\", she said.   * Northern children 'too often left behind'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43500164)   * Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38172816)  But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived.   He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. \"Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,\" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were \"overly impressed by schools' level of attainment\" rather than looking at children's progress.  * Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34964522) But even accounting for that, there are still regional differences when you look at how well schools are rated(https://public.tableau.com/profile/ofsted!/vizhome/Dataview/Viewregionalperformanceovertime) in the comparably deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber.  It's not as simple as north vs south In 2015, the government produced figures on multiple indices of deprivation(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465791 /English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Statistical_Release.pdf) looking at seven main things:   * Income   * Employment   * Health deprivation and disability   * Education, skills and training   * Barriers to housing and services   * Crime   * Living environment  And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as \"south=rich, north=poor\". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption East Jaywick in Essex came out as the most deprived town in England based on the government's multiple indices of deprivation  Is London a special case? Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country.   Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average.   But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government, starting from the mid- 1990s.(https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8006) In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment.  What about the money?   A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like:   * Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals   * Children in the care of the state   * Children with special education needs   * Children who speak English as an additional language   * Schools in areas with a high cost of living  The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving \\xa3500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.   ",

Promoted by the Kremlin as a model for grooming talent, Sirius runs 600 exceptional students a month through intensive courses in everything from physics and coding to chess and ballet. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iz6lJk3zbNwQ/v7/60x-1.jpg) Letovo\\xa0school Source: Letovo  cThe more intelligent and educated people are, the less aggressive they are, Putin, a self-confessed street thug in his youth, told the children last July.     Putin 9s own aggression on the world stage has become an unexpected\\xa0catalyst for an investment boom in Russian education. As U.S. and European leaders continue to work to isolate Russia\\xa0over alleged election meddling and the conflict in Ukraine, a growing number of tycoons are pulling their children out of western schools and putting money into private projects that will aid Putin 9s attempts to reverse a decline in national academic rankings. Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine a month after the Sochi Olympics, more than 30 billionaires and senior executives with investments abroad have founded or helped fund projects to nurture students at home. The outlays coincide\\xa0with a halving in the number of new Russian enrollments at boarding schools in Britain, long the educational destination of choice for the country 9s elite, to 608 last year, according to the U.K. Independent Schools Council.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs Herman Gref, head of state savings bank Sberbank, opened a school called Horoshkola with his wife Yana in Moscow in September, joining billionaire Suleyman Kerimov 9s Zarechenskaya\\xa0Shkola and transport tycoon Nikita Mishin 9s Novaya Shkola.

Even his youngest son won 9t be admitted unless he passes the blindly graded entrance exam like everyone else, he said.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs from Rublyovka, Moshkovich said in an interview, referring to one of Moscow 9s poshest districts. cEducation is the key driver in the modern world and I want Russia to be competitive. This is for soul and country.     The first nation in space has fallen behind relative newcomers in math and science, mainly from Asia. A top six finisher in the pre-college International Mathematical Olympiad every year until 2015, Russia tumbled to a worst-ever 11th last year, behind upstarts like Vietnam, Iran and Thailand. On a broader level, Russia is middling, ranking 32nd out of the 72 countries in the PISA exam of 15-year-olds, far behind Estonia, a fellow former Soviet republic.   The World Bank warned in November that low government\\xa0spending on education and health in Russia ``may jeopardize both economic growth and the well-being of the population. 9 9 Russia spends about\\xa03.6 percent of economic output on each category,\\xa0compared with 4.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, in the European Union, the Washington-based lender said. Retooling the educational system after communism 9s failure remains a work in progress. Critics like Moshkovich, who got his graduate degree from the Moscow Institute of Radio, Electronics and Automatics, say low morale and chronic underfunding 4even the best teachers can earn less than $250 a month 4are just parts of the problem. They say state primary and secondary schools still rely too much on memorization and standardized testing and don 9t do enough to encourage critical and creative thinking.  cThere 9s no other project like it in Russia Moshkovich, 50, who made his fortune in sugar and pork, retired from the senate in 2014 to focus\\xa0on education. He 9s hoping the methods he 9s developing at Letovo will stimulate reforms nationwide. His school will offer students both a Russian diploma and a certificate from\\xa0International Baccalaureate, a Swiss non-profit with a curriculum it says cprepares students to succeed in a world where facts and fiction merge in the news. Letovo is modeled on the best international institutions in the world, with an expert council staffed by recruits from schools that understand the importance of atmosphere in learning like Winchester College in the U.K., Montgomery Bell in the U.S. and Raffles in Singapore, Moshkovich said. His $80 million campus includes dormitories, tennis courts, a soccer field, a running track, a stream and an artificial lake rimmed by pine forest. The other $120 million is set aside in an endowment, most of which is already deposited in Sberbank and earning interest. Tuition will run about $20,000 a year, half of what a comparable British school charges, but parents who can 9t afford the full amount will be eligible for grants on a sliding scale.

Shchukin said Letovo may be a game-changer not only for his industry but for the Russian system as a whole. Everyone who 9s interested in education is watching very closely because its success may spur more investment, giving parents even more domestic schooling options, he said. Letovo is already taking applications for Sept. 1, when it will welcome 170 students in grades seven to nine. Once fully operational in 2020, Moshkovich said 1,100 students in grades seven\\xa0to 11 will be receiving instruction from 160 of the best educators money can buy, including 60 foreigners.  cI 9ve already fulfilled my ambitions in business, I won 9t be able to spend the money I 9ve earned, the billionaire said. cMy goal now is to provide Russian children with a world-class education.

The analysis says in the North East 35% of white working-class students have entered with only vocational exams. The think tank is calling for more recognition of how exams other than A-levels are used to get into university, particularly by poorer students. And it warns of \"institutional snobbery\" against vocational exams. The research from the Social Market Foundation highlights how vocational qualifications are used for university applications - with about a fifth of places being awarded entirely on the basis of vocational exams.     Vocational exams 'ignored' But this is not evenly spread - with the report highlighting that working- class students from the north of England are particularly likely to have gained places with vocational qualifications. Young people from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications, such as BTecs. Children from poorer families are twice as likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications than the children of professional families. There is also a regional difference, with fewer people in the South applying with vocational qualifications. The think tank says this social divide produces an unhelpful bias in the system - with A-levels dominating political debate about university entry. The report says the emphasis on A-levels means that universities do not always give enough support or recognition for applicants with vocational qualifications. Entry requirements can often be set in A-levels, with the risk of putting off applicants with vocational qualifications. \"For too long, politicians and the media alike have ignored and even belittled the vocational route, because politics and the media are dominated by people who took the traditional route of A-levels then university,\" said James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation. \"Most of the people who run the country didn't do BTecs, and they don't come from the sort of background where BTecs matter most. \"The result is institutional snobbery against vocational qualifications and the people who have them.\" Maddalaine Ansell, chief executive of the University Alliance group of universities, said there had to be support for vocational alternatives to A-levels as a route into higher education - so they did not \"end up being dead-ends\".

Also pupils' progress in digital skills has not kept pace with technology, said Estyn in its annual report. The chief inspector welcomed a shift towards a \"culture of self-improvement\" and more joint working between schools. Half of secondary and 70% of primary schools inspected were judged good or excellent in 2016-17. This is broadly in line with overall results since 2010 with the rest judged adequate or unsatisfactory.    Looking after pupils' wellbeing is one of the strongest features of the education system, while standards and teaching are relatively weaker, according to Estyn. Chief inspector Meilyr Rowlands said \"there is much to be proud of in the Welsh education system\" and there are \"many strengths\" in nurseries, maintained special schools and in further education colleges. \"Variability, however, remains a challenge in most other sectors,\" he said. The education secretary welcomed the report as showing sustained momentum in the education system. Estyn's 2016-17 annual report looks at key policy areas over the past seven years, back to 2010 when the current inspection cycle began.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Literacy and numeracy** Poor results in Pisa international tests(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-25196974) were a key reason for introducing a new emphasis on literacy and numeracy in 2013 as well as a national reading and numeracy test for seven to 14-year-olds.(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38172346) The report says that since then there have been improvements in how schools promote literacy but the standard of pupils' writing is weaker than other aspects. In many primary schools \"pupils struggle to write creatively and do not write at length frequently enough\" and \"too many pupils continue to make basic errors in spelling and punctuation\". Over the seven-year inspection cycle the inspectorate found that in primary schools \"enthusiasm for literature, their knowledge of different authors and stories, and their ability to express preferences about specific books, authors or genres have declined\". Overall the report found that the teaching of numeracy has improved. But the report says: \"In about a third of primary schools and three-fifths of secondary schools, there are shortcomings in the way that schools plan for and ensure that pupils use and develop their numeracy skills across the curriculum.\"   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Developing digital skills** There has been an emphasis on boosting digital and information technology skills in recent years and, along with literacy and numeracy, schools will be expected to emphasise it in all elements of the new curriculum which will be rolled out from 2022. But the report says that opportunities to develop information communication technology (ICT) skills across subjects are \"limited in many secondary schools and a third of primary schools\". In just under two-thirds of primary schools, there are \"important shortcomings in standards of ICT\". Though most pupils are confident using programmes such as word processing and creating presentations, their skills are often limited to \"a narrow range of applications\".   * Are Welsh schools teaching enough digital skills?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39455837)   * Learning on iPads 'more enjoyable'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37429889)   * Computers 'do not improve pupils' results'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34174796)    Image copyrightGetty Images  **The Foundation Phase** Since 2011, three to seven-year-olds have been taught through the Foundation Phase(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42271232), which is meant to be a less formal way of learning through activities. But the report says that overall its application has been \"inconsistent\" and though there is generally a strong commitment to the principles \"more recently there has been increasing formality\". It says only about a quarter of schools deliver the Foundation Phase well and about three-quarters of head teachers do not fully understand the principles behind it.     Click to see content: estyn1_jan18(//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/estyn1_jan18)     **Tackling the effects of disadvantage** Another major priority in education policy over the past seven years has been tackling the impact of poverty on pupils' performance at school and, though the chief inspector has found that there is now a stronger focus in schools on this aim, the gap has not narrowed at GCSE(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-41513404). The report also notes \"despite some improvements, the attendance of pupils that are eligible for free school meals continues to be a concern at all phases\". Over the last three years, about 40% of 14 to 16-year-olds eligible for free school meals have less than 90% attendance compared to 16% of other pupils.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Primary schools** Between 2010 and 2017 there were improvements in the performance of boys and pupils eligible for free school meals. But in a third of schools more able pupils \"do not achieve what they are capable of\". Standards of wellbeing have been good or better in seven in 10 schools and attendance has improved in most schools. But the quality of teaching has varied over the past seven years. In 2016-17, 20% of the primary schools inspected were judged as excellent, and six schools (3%) were put in special measures due to failings.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Secondary schools** Half of secondary schools inspected in 2016-17 were good or excellent, a significantly lower proportion than primary schools. The report says that one possible reason why primary school inspection outcomes are better on average than those for secondary schools is the effect that external examinations can have. The proportion of schools with unsatisfactory standards generally increased between 2010 and 2017. Schools have performed well in terms of pupils' wellbeing and one of the greatest improvements has been in attendance, up from 91.4% in 2011 to 94.1% in 2017. Improved teaching is needed in a majority of schools inspected this year and over the past seven years, the report says.     **Welsh language development** When it comes to the Welsh language, in the early school years nearly all Welsh-medium schools and most English-medium schools pupils \"make a good start\" when learning to speak and listen in Welsh. But there are weaknesses in the way many local authorities plan for Welsh language provision and recruiting Welsh medium staff is \"a challenge across many areas of Wales\", says the report.   !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05vvl86.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionOldcastle Primary in Bridgend already collaborates with other schools on numeracy  School-to school collaboration More cooperation between schools is seen as one of the biggest shifts in education over the past seven years and Estyn believes there is enough excellence across Welsh education to support improvement and help reduce variability. The \"spirit of cooperation\" was most obvious in the way that the new curriculum is being developed.    Political and professional reaction David Evans, Wales secretary of the teaching union, National Education Union Cymru (NEU), said: \"This report shows that despite increasingly difficult funding settlements and the ongoing concerns of workload, schools and teachers in Wales are continuing to provide an education service we can be proud of. \" He said it was \"especially good news\" to see Estyn praising schools for working constructively together. Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said the move towards a culture of self-improvement within Welsh education was not enough to raise standards. He said: \"Everyone knows that unless the government urgently address the underlying issues of diminishing education budgets and failures on recruiting and retaining teachers, this new culture is merely a case of building a house on sand.\" Welsh Conservatives education spokesman Darren Millar said the report highlighted many of the same concerns from previous annual reports. \"It's clear that we need to make much more rapid progress to ensure that our children get the high quality education they deserve,\" he said. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"Our national mission for education seeks to raise standards, reduce the attainment gap and deliver an education system that is a source of national pride and enjoys public confidence. \"The report notes our efforts to reduce the attainment gap, but we know there is no room for complacency. \"That's why we're doubling the Pupil Development Grant(http://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/schoolshome/deprivation/pdg- and-early-years-pdg/?lang=en) for our youngest learners, so that every child has the opportunity to reach their potential.\"   ",

The ban, which came into effect on Thursday, is part of a policy that, the government says, is in line with a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 that said teaching English may hinder the students' proficiency in Korean.  \"According to many English education experts and neuroscientists, the right age for learning English as a second language is the third grade,\" Kwon Ji- young, director of early childhood education and care policy division at the Ministry of Education, told Al Jazeera.  \"Starting second-language education at preschool is too early. Before that, social skills and cognitive development should take place. A lot of parents think earlier the better when it comes to learning a second language.\"  In South Korea, kindergartens that conduct English classes are not officially registered as pre-schools but operate as private academies.  Although expensive, the growing demand for early English education has made these outlets very popular among parents who can afford them.  Korea's\\xa0annual household income(https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/korea/annual-household-income- per-capita)\\xa0per capita is $15,335.\\xa0Some of these outlets charge more than $1,500 a month.   !(/mritems/Images/2018/3/2/deff1c416a3d4de7bd3dd0c5a84b7542_18.jpg)  ---  Kim has warned of a widening gap between 'haves' and 'have-nots' after the ban Faras Ghani/Al Jazeera     The ban, which will also see around 7,000 teachers lose their jobs, will create a further divide with children from low-income families set to miss out in a highly competitive society, say experts.  \"If, after the second grade, you compare the ones who received private English lessons with the ones who didn't, the difference will be huge. In Korean society, the more money you have, the more educated you can be,\" said Kim Hee- won, a private English teacher.  Kim, who has been teaching in the capital Seoul since 2003, ruled out English learning having an adverse effect on a child's proficiency in Korean.  She did, however, warn of the increase in demand for English institutions and also of the competitiveness that exists among parents.   {articleGUID}   \"In Korea, some mothers compare what kind of stroller they have for their kids, which hospital their child was born in and how they want to follow the trends.  \"The level of competition is very fierce, and they will spend a lot of money to ensure their child gets taught English.\"  Hwang Hee-jung, a single mother to Ko Jae-joon, agrees. Her son was born in the US and was studying in a Korean school in Seoul until last year when she transferred him to an international school.  \"I think speaking English is very important because the university admission exam we have\\xa0is very tough and students need to get a high score in English to pass,\" said Hwang.  \"In a Korean school, my son was taught English just one hour a week. Now, majority of his lessons are in English, and the more he practises, the better he will get.\"       ---   How an exam brings South Korea to a halt      Together with the ban, the ministry has issued a warning and reminder to Korean parents, urging them to treat English as a second language.  \"It's important how parents perceive English as a second language. Korean children are exposed to stressful learning conditions due to academic pressure. It even starts before they are born,\" said Kwon.  \"The Ministry tries to conduct programmes and seminars for parents to improve their perception of English education.\"  A Ministry of Education official, who wished to remain anonymous, said there would be plans put in place for children from low-income families.  \"The Ministry has plans which include offering financial help to attend English programmes and assisting schools which lack resources to create those programmes,\" the official said.   {articleGUID}   Mobile phone apps and online translation software are being increasingly used for basic communication.  But critics say English fluency is needed more than ever, especially in a society where long hours and extra effort often does not result in success due to the level of competition.  Korean parents will seek private lessons for their children in the aftermath, said one parent, before adding that the assurances handed out by the government will not count for much.  \"We will encounter the unavoidable gap between the haves and the have-nots. It's simple: No money, no opportunity, no education. That's how it will affect the children here in Korea.\"   ** _With additional reporting by Wooyoung Lee_**  ",

Ms. Lee seized on a proposed $1 million cut to the department 9s Office for Civil Rights, and its proposed cuts to after-school programs. , The cuts, coupled with the Trump administration 9s decision to examine and possibly rescind guidance meant to protect minority students from racial discrimination in discipline(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics /school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html) and special education decisions, inflamed a debate about the department 9s approach to minority students. ,  cYour head is in the sand about racial bias and racial discrimination, Ms. Lee said, adding: cYou just don 9t care about civil rights of black and brown children. This is horrible. , Ms. DeVos said that she was cvery proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights, and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination. , She also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools. ,  cI believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education, Ms. DeVos said. , She also defended her agency 9s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school-shootings- obama-discipline-policies.html) of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month. ,  cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps, Ms. DeVos said. cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is. , Ms. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country. , Ms. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association. , Ms. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to cspend taxpayer dollars efficiently. , The directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos 9s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee. , One week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was obtained by The New York Times(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/education-secretary- devos-reorganization-plan-union.html). ,  cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department 9s plans for fiscal year 2019, the email said. cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this. , Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was cabsolutely not true that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present. ,  cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that 4 a deliberative document not in final form, she said. cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization. , While it is not abnormal for education secretaries to reorganize the department, and not many decisions require congressional approval, it is also customary for the department to share details with key committees. , In the email, the staff member leaked a reorganization plan that included a consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Labor Department. , Education Department officials said they had since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most protested part of the proposal. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump 9s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. , Though the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House 9s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico(https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/14/devos- defies-white-house-education-budget-414849). Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. , Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department 9s programs and resources. , Ms. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop. , Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about ca disconnect between Ms. DeVos 9s administration and his office. ,  cIt 9s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don 9t have staff that understand how the system works, Mr. Frelinghuysen said. cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills. , The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts. , For the most part, Ms. DeVos 9s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services. , Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department 9s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department 9s overhaul. , Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of cofficial time, which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. , The union said the agreement came cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table, which concluded with the department 9s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. , The department said that the union cspent more than a year dragging its feet, and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. , The department put its final offer in place.

            "article": " PARENTS in England are faced with a choice when their children are old enough to attend secondary school. They can pay to send their offspring to a private school, which usually involves sitting an entrance exam. Alternatively, in some parts of the country, the child can sit an eleven-plus exam and, provided they pass, attend a grammar school. Grammar schools are publicly funded and tend to excel in league tables of academic performance. The overwhelming majority (about 90%) of British pupils, however, attend non-selective state schools. Debate has raged for years over whether most selective schools do well because they provide a better education than state schools, or merely because they cream off the brightest and most privileged. According to research led by Robert Plomin and Emily Smith-Woolley, both of King 9s College London, the educational benefits of selective schools largely disappear once the innate ability and socio-economic background of pupils at selective schools are taken into account.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

That information includes DNA data and the results of intelligence tests and exams. At first the researchers calculated a genetic score taken for each child by adding up contributions from thousands of minor variations in their DNA that past studies (including data from 300,000 individuals) have linked to educational attainment. Pupils attending grammar and private schools had significantly higher genetic scores than those in comprehensives. But when those scores were adjusted to reflect each child 9s test results at 11, as well as the education and occupations of their parents, the differences vanished. That makes sense. Previous research has shown that many of the traits that selective schools are screening for are, in part, inherited from their parents. The tests being used by schools appear to be inadvertently picking up some of these genetic differences. The researchers then scored each child based on the results of science, maths and English GCSE exams, typically taken by all schoolchildren in England and Wales at the age of 16. On average, the results of children at private or grammar schools were a full GCSE grade higher than those at state schools. That suggests attending a selective school gives children a boost. Without correcting for any other factors the researchers calculated the boost to be worth about 7.1% of the difference in GCSE results. But was this due to better teaching at these schools or an outcome of the selection procedure? To see, the team adjusted the grades based on the results of each child 9s test scores, family circumstances and genes. Once they did this, the gap between the schools narrowed dramatically, with school type explaining just 0.5% of the difference in average GCSE grades. For any individual, genetics accounted for about 8% of the difference, modest in comparison with the many other factors involved, such as socio-economic backgrounds, test results at 11 and things still to be accounted for. The research comes with important caveats. First, the thousands of genetic variations so far linked to educational attainment are not well understood. Many of these variations may not be linked to intelligence at all. If, for instance, a weak bladder leads a child to perform poorly in timed exams or protuberant ears means bullying blighted their education, genetic variants for these traits will show up as disadvantageous. Stronger bladders and flatter ears will therefore confer advantages and better genetic scores. Second, had the study also been conducted in a nation, such as Denmark, where wealth is more evenly spread it is possible that genetics would appear to play a bigger role in educational outcomes, because socioeconomic disparities would have a lesser impact. The research does not appear to support cprogressive eugenics d, as advanced by Toby Young, a journalist and a co-author of the study. Mr Young has argued that poor people should be able to screen embryos free on the basis of intelligence, if the technology becomes available. Setting aside ethical questions, many of the genetic differences that might appear to contribute to social mobility (think flatter ears, etc) may not be associated with actual intelligence. Overall, such an idea might shift educational attainment by a few percentage points at best. That is tiny compared with the advantages enjoyed by the children of the educated and wealthy.

            "article": "  Libertarian economist Bryan Caplan didn 9t strive for subtlety when he titled his new book _The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_. As I wrote in a  Remarks column(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/the-case-against- college) in the print edition of _Bloomberg Businessweek_ , the George Mason University professor makes a strong case that most of what people learn in high school and college is unnecessary and quickly forgotten. He says that only about a fifth of the value of an education is the increase in human capital. The rest is csignaling 4the degree itself puts you in line ahead of non-graduates, even if you learned nothing useful, because it tells potential employers that you 9re reasonably smart, reasonably determined to complete what you started, and reasonably good at fitting in. Signaling is a zero-sum game: possibly useful for the individual who gets ahead, but wasteful for society. I recommend the book. Still,\\xa0I can 9t fully buy\\xa0Caplan 9s conclusion that the solution is to cut back drastically on taxpayer support for college, and even high school. Caplan\\xa0disagrees with my disagreement. On the\\xa0blog he shares with some other economists, EconLog, he called(http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2018/01/two_comments_on.html) my article cfun and fair but indicated that I had fallen victim to csocial desirability bias by arguing that society should bend over backward not to deprive lower-income strivers of the human capital that college does build. (He also made a fair point\\xa0about my throwaway line concerning Sanskrit and cement mixing, and I agree with him, so set that aside.) Here 9s Caplan: > Human beings like saying 4\\xa0and believing 4\\xa0whatever sounds good, even if what sounds good makes little sense.\\xa0My question for Coy: If deleting 80% of the perceived social rewards of education makes you no more willing to cut public support for public education, what would?\\xa0 What if we deleted 90% of education&apos;s perceived social rewards?\\xa095%\\xa099%?\\xa0I know it sounds nice to say, \"If it helps one person, it&apos;s worth it,\" but that&apos;s crazy.\\xa0No one spends their own money so casually 4\\xa0nor should they.\\xa0Furthermore, you can easily use some of the budgetary savings to help \"strivers\" in more cost-effective ways.\\xa0So why not?     So let me answer that question. I accept Caplan 9s economics-y point that life involves trade-offs. If public support for education helped just one person while costing $1 trillion, it wouldn 9t be worth it. Likewise, if Caplan could prove that wasteful signaling accounts for 99\\xa0percent of the value of\\xa0education. But that 9s not what he says. He says it accounts for 80 percent of the value of education. Some other economists put the ratio considerably lower 4less than half. And reforms could further increase the amount of human capital that the education system creates. In other words, education really does educate, even if it is overly expensive and not very effective. When you yank public funding from education, you are making it difficult or impossible for children who grew up poor or in the lower middle class to get the same access to learning that children of rich families take for granted. As for Caplan 9s idea of using some of the savings to help strivers in more cost-effective ways: Tracking low-income students toward vocational education because it 9s all they can afford feels Dickensian(http://dickens.port.ac.uk/poverty/). Libertarians such as\\xa0Caplan\\xa0stress individual liberty and minimal taxation. Most of us are a bit more communitarian, meaning that we 9re more likely to think of society as a family. A family tries to give every child the very best shot at success, even when it is (overly) expensive to do so. If that 9s what Caplan\\xa0wants to call csocial desirability bias, so be it.   ",

I say it's time we work together to end it. !Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170409101815-equal-pay-women- large-169.jpg)(/2017/04/11/opinions/equal-pay-talk-should-be-for-all-women- jones-opinion/index.html) Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(/2017/04/11/opinions/equal- pay-talk-should-be-for-all-women-jones-opinion/index.html) At the American Association of University Women (AAUW), our 170,000 members(https://www.aauw.org/) and supporters throughout the 50 states and US territories have a goal: Close the pay gap now. And we have a plan(https://www.aauw.org/fairpay/). No single act will do it -- we need to bring the pieces together for change. First, we need strong federal and state pay equity laws. It's been more than 50 years since the Equal Pay Act of 1963(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm), prohibiting workplace wage discrimination on the basis of sex and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm), barring all employment discrimination on the basis of race, religion and national origin, as well as sex. While these laws helped to make advances, they are in need of 21st century updates. In short, times have changed, and laws must too. And many states are now taking action. In 2017, 42 states(https://www.aauw.org/2017/10/13/state- equal-pay-victories-in-2017/) introduced laws to address the wage gap. Their strategies ranged from banning salary histories to ensuring employees have vital access to salary information in order to identify if they are being paid unfairly. Five states and Puerto Rico succeeded in passing their laws. This year, per AAUW's internal monitoring, 38 states have pay equity legislation under consideration, with a new law passing in Washington state just last month. !Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404161412-starbucks-maternity- leave-2-large-169.jpg)(/2017/04/04/opinions/paid-family-leave-for-all- boushey-bethell/index.html) Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(/2017/04/04/opinions/paid- family-leave-for-all-boushey-bethell/index.html) Second, we must change employer practices and break down barriers for women. Growing numbers of employers recognize fair pay and good benefits are not just good for employees, they are good for business and bottom lines.

Third, we must support women in advocating for themselves. At AAUW, we are launching a new commitment to train 10 million women to negotiate their financial futures by 2022. Through AAUW's Work Smart program(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http- 3A__bit.ly_NegotiateNow&d=DwMFAg&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=rz4oN5WSLeQq9veWzO9LvZAr9bK4sqmmNDo8Im869pQ&m=lzq8NpCMw1nOFMa4S9ogjy6OBzNAZKtQyl408muoK8o&s=q-fIRYr4yaxhEdC9yX6Jb3SR9xJZkGEEb5CjKF8niQM&e=), we will give women the skills they need to effectively understand their market worth -- based on experience and accomplishments -- and the tools and confidence to negotiate for it. In workshops around the country, we have seen that when women negotiate for higher pay, it can result in more income for themselves and their families. While you can't negotiate around discrimination, this effort will help accelerate change for women and the broader movement for equal pay.

            "article": "  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio named Richard Carranza, Houston 9s superintendent of schools, to run the largest U.S. school system, days after learning that his first choice for the job had decided to remain in Miami. Carranza, 51, a second-generation Mexican-American, has run the Houston school system since August 2016. He previously had been San Francisco 9s superintendent for four years and led school systems in Tucson and Las Vegas before that.\\xa0 Carranza joined de Blasio to announce the appointment at a City Hall news conference Monday. Last week, Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho reneged on an agreement to take the job.        Describing Carranza as the embodiment of the American Dream, de Blasio recounted the educator 9s upbringing as the child of immigrants who valued education.\\xa0He praised Carranza 9s success in increasing test scores among black and Latino students.  cIn everything he 9s done, he 9s been devoted to children and he 9s been a change agent in his work, de Blasio said. cHe has a proven record as someone who can get results while moving an equity agenda.

That's a 26% increase -- roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of the US and China combined. But in the past year, US policymakers have taken drastic steps backward that will cut this progress off at the knees -- trapping women, families, and countries in poverty.

            "article": " Early in her career, Jewelle Bickford, now a partner at Evercore Wealth Management, worked at a global bank in New York with a male colleague who was on his best behavior during the first half of the day, she said, but during and after lunch, his work ethic devolved. cWhen he came back, you would walk by his office, and he would have his head down, Ms. Bickford said. cAnd you knew he had had quite a few drinks. , At the end of the year, when bonuses were announced, a friend of Ms. Bickford 9s who worked in human resources told her how much that male colleague had received. cIt was many multiples of what I made, Ms. Bickford said. cHe stayed there. I left. , It was a Monday in late January, and Ms. Bickford was at a table with four other women in a semiprivate room at Kiki 9s, a Greek restaurant in the Chinatown neighborhood in Manhattan. They included Gayl Johnson, a director of administration in New York City 9s Department of Sanitation; Alix Keller, the director of product technology at Hello Alfred, a home concierge service; Melissa Robbins, a Philadelphia-based political strategist; and Kimberly Webster, formerly a lawyer at a New York firm. , The women were of different backgrounds, ages and professions, but they had one thing in common: All said they had experienced gender-based wage discrimination over the course of their careers. , Though the pay gap has long been in the public consciousness 4 on average, American women make 80 cents for every dollar(http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness /fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf) men make 4 three recent incidents have brought renewed scrutiny to an issue many women in the workplace say they continue to confront on an almost daily basis.. , Early last month, Debra Messing and Eva Longoria chastised E!(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/movies/debra-messing-catt- sadler-e-news.html) on the Golden Globes red carpet for paying Catt Sadler, the former co-host of E! News, half of what her male colleague, Jason Kennedy, made. (Ms. Sadler left the network in December(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/arts/television/catt-sadler-e -equal-pay.html).) The next day, Carrie Grace, the former China editor of the BBC, resigned that position after salary figures released by the broadcaster showed a gap between male and female talent(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/europe/bbc-salaries-pay- gender.html). , And, of course, there is the perhaps the most famous recent incident 4 the revelation that Michelle Williams was paid $80 a day for reshoots(https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/09/exclusive- wahlberg-paid-1-5-m-all-money-reshoot-williams-got-less- than-1-000/1018351001/) on cAll the Money in the World while her male co-star, Mark Wahlberg, was paid $1.5 million in total (he later donated it to charity(http://deadline.com/2018/01/mark-wahlberg-michelle-williams- timesup-donation-million-and-one-half-donation-all-the-money-in-the- world-1202242504/), following an outcry) 4 that got many women in offices around the country swapping tales of when in their own careers they found out they were being paid less than their male counterparts and what they did (or did not do) about it. ,  cI never really complained about the pay discrepancy, Ms. Bickford, 76, said, pausing between bites of moussaka. cI was brought up in a culture where it was considered gauche. ,  cI missed that class, said Ms. Johnson. (Age? cYou can say 855 plus. 9 d) Ms. Johnson, who was sitting diagonally across from Ms. Bickford, took a bite of her lamb chop. cI 9ve been doing this job for over 20 years, Ms. Johnson said. cI started as a clerk and worked my way up. I 9ve had five promotions. But my white male counterparts earn $25,000 to $30,000 more a year than I do. , Ms. Johnson is one of 1,000 women on whose behalf a local union(http://www.cwa1180.org/) filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2013, claiming that the city paid women and minorities substantially less than their white male colleagues. In 2015, the E.E.O.C. ruled in favor of the women(https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/nyregion/new-york-city- discriminated-in-paying-managers-commission-finds.html?_r=1) and recommended that the city negotiate a payout. The suggested starting point was $246 million. Though the city and the union came to a broad agreement(https://www.amny.com/news/women-city-workers-reach-settlement-over- unequal-pay-1.13361145) last April, the details are still being worked out. , To help the union build its case, Ms. Johnson spent years gathering information. And she was not shy about demanding her rights. Once, she said, she called a supervisor and asked why she was making less than a male counterpart. The answer, she said: cHe has a family to support. , Ms. Johnson is a single mother of three. Her experience is one example of what 9s called the motherhood penalty(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/a-child-helps-your-career- if-youre-a-man.html?_r=0), a term for the economic and career setbacks women experience when they have children. (Men 9s earnings went up by more than 6 percent when they had children, if they lived with them, and women 9s decreased 4 percent for each child they had, a study found(http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood- penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay). And research(http://gender.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/motherhoodpenalty.pdf) has shown that employers rate fathers as the most desirable employees.) , Ms. Keller, 35, is raising a 9-year-old son alone. cI 9ve made about 40 percent less than a colleague that 9s maybe only a tiny level above me, someone I didn 9t report to, Ms. Keller said. cI 9ve been in a situation where a male colleague was making 100 percent more. I almost died inside. , Next to Ms. Keller was Ms. Robbins. cThe last campaign I was working on, I told my campaign manager, 8We 9re going to lose if we do this your way, 9 said Ms. Robbins, who declined to provide her age. cSixty-five percent of my salary was cut. My leadership as a black woman meant nothing to them. , Ms. Robbins described another job in sales where she asked for a raise, from $14 an hour, after bringing in a major client. According to Ms. Robbins, the company 9s owner refused. After quitting, Ms. Robbins said, a man was hired to replace her. His salary? More than twice as much. cThat was the most humiliating experience that I have ever had, she said. , Sitting across from Ms. Robbins was Ms. Webster, 36, who says she left the law firm she was working for in 2016 after she wrote a letter to the partners suggesting that they were acting out unconscious bias. cAt least for one case, and it may have been for multiple cases, my time was being billed out at a lower rate than two of the three white, male paralegals, Ms. Webster said. cThe very next business day, I got put on a performance improvement plan, she added. cThey were putting the paperwork in motion to either justify firing me or getting me to leave. , Retaliatory practices toward employees who complain about discrimination are far from abnormal. The E.E.O.C. reported(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/retaliation_considerations.cfm) that 48.8 percent of the complaints filed by workers in 2017 contained an allegation of retaliation. , Toward the end of the evening, entrees were forgotten and talk turned to the current moment and the future. cI believe we 9re at a tipping point, Ms. Bickford said. cThe computer has really helped us disseminate information, and I think men are on notice now. Ms. Bickford and her colleagues in the business world have formed the Paradigm for Parity(https://www.paradigm4parity.com/), which provides a five-step plan for gender equality that they have persuaded dozens of corporate leaders to implement. , Ms. Robbins was recently one of the speakers at the Women 9s March in Philadelphia and is working to help elect more female leaders. And Ms. Johnson plans to stick around in city administration and in the union as long as she can. cWe have to look out for the ones who follow behind us, Ms. Johnson said. cThere are more battles to be fought. Everyone deserves a chance.  ",

            "article": " What differentiates the Mayfield Innovation Center(http://www.mayfieldschools.org/MayfieldInnovationCenter.aspx) from traditional classrooms is evident not just in the virtual reality technology, the 3-D printers or the open architecture that make the two-floor, 30,000 -square-foot building seem less of a secondary school than a Google satellite office. , It is also in the words emblazoned on the crimson-colored wall of the Computer-Aided Drafting and Design lab, a quote attributed to Curt Richardson, the founder of OtterBox, which makes consumer electronics accessories: , _Failure is a part of innovation. Perhaps the most important part_. , Wait a minute. Failure, being extolled, even celebrated? In a high school? , Yes, in part because this is not a typical school. The center at suburban Mayfield City Schools, a district of 4,300 K-12 students 15 miles east of Cleveland, is a striking example of an approach to education that could eventually make traditional methods as outdated as chalk and blackboards. , Mayfield 9s model is described as project-based, team-centered, career and industry-aligned learning. , Project Lead the Way(https://www.pltw.org/our-programs?&gclid =EAIaIQobChMIrNjWwvLk2QIVA- EbCh0J6gftEAAYASAAEgL40_D_BwE&utm_campaign=Null_PLTW_General_Brand&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google), an Indianapolis-based nonprofit that is one of the prime progenitors of this educational philosophy, articulates it in its mission statement: ,  cWe believe all students 4 beginning at a young age 4 need access to real-world, applied learning experiences that empower them to gain the skills they need to thrive in college, career and beyond. , At programs like Mayfield 9s 4 where 11 teachers have completed Project Lead the Way 9s certification since 2014 4 that means not only access to state-of-the-art technology, but also partnerships with local organizations to provide those experiences. These include the Cleveland Clinic, which collaborated with the high school this semester in a six-week project in cardiopulmonary education. , Eighty-seven students in grades 9 through 12 were assigned cases that required learning about the anatomy of the heart, as well as advanced medical technologies addressing heart disease. Working in teams of five or six, the students used materials like balsa wood and foam board to create three- dimensional models showing specific problems in the heart, and they became immersed in sophisticated virtual reality simulations that allowed them to see a stent being inserted into an occluded artery. , During the process they were mentored not only by their own teachers, but also by staff members from the hospital. Maria Held(https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/7274-maria-held), a clinical nurse specialist, was dazzled by the Innovation Center, a $3 million facility that opened in 2015 and was largely paid for by a bond issue. ,  cIt 9s almost futuristic, Ms. Held said. cEspecially compared to when I was in school. , Keith Kelly, superintendent of the Mayfield City School District, said the center was cabout getting kids involved in inquiry, in solving problems, in partnerships, in authentic projects that may be of interest to them. , And it is not just the schools that are driving this. The project-centered approach to education involves industry and colleges as well. Here are some other examples. , The Pasadena, Calif., Unified School District 4 a district in which 65 percent of the students qualify for free and reduced-price lunches 4 has nine career-themed cacademies for its high school students. These are learning environments that closely simulate various industries and professional settings, and include an app development lab, a credit union, a digital film studio and even a courtroom. , All are supervised by teachers working with advisory boards and mentors from local industry, including such organizations as McDonnell Douglas, Caltech, Kaiser Permanente and Saatchi. , Superintendent Brian McDonald calls it a clinked learning approach 4 linking core academic content with a strong set of career technical education course and work-based learning opportunities. cI really think this is the future of education, he said. , Toyota has a number of initiatives aimed at funneling students into careers with the automaker, via partnerships with 256 high schools, summer internships for high school students, specialized degree tracks, and part-time employment at the college level and eventually, for those who finish the pathway, jobs. , The company 9s $10.3 million commitment is intended to address what the program developer, Dennis Dio Parker, calls cthe crisis level shortage of advanced manufacturing technicians facing his industry. ,  cThis is self-motivated change, said Mr. Parker, who is based at the automaker 9s Georgetown, Ky., production support center. cInstead of complaining and griping and pontificating about the educational system, we realized that we had to do something about it. , Toyota, some say, is a model for other industries. cThey send a clear signal to all employers that schools can 9t do this alone, said Vince Bertram, president and chief executive of Project Lead the Way. cIf we 9re going to solve the skills gap, we have to work together. , While many of these innovative programs are STEM-oriented, one partnership between higher and secondary education in Massachusetts seeks to address a different problem: a shortage of nonwhite teachers in the classroom. ,  cAs the number of students continues to diversify in terms of race, language and ethnicity, the teachers are still about 90 to 92 percent white, said Claudia Rinaldi, the director of the education department at Lasell College in Newton, Mass. (Nationwide, the number is about 85 percent.) , Lasell 9s cPathways to Teacher Diversity 4 part of a statewide effort supported by a Gates Foundation grant 4 is a partnership with four school districts in the state intended to encourage more high school students of color to pursue careers in education. cResearch suggests that when these students have a teacher of color, they do better, Ms. Rinaldi said. , An orientation meeting for the Pathways program a year ago attracted 160 students from the four districts. The first group of 12 is getting college credit for an introductory teaching course; an additional 26 are being mentored by Ms. Rinaldi 9s Lasell students. , The long-term goal, she said, is to get these students to return, as certified teachers, to K-12 schools like the ones they attended. cThe districts are hungry to diversify their teaching force. , In 1972, City-as-School High School was established by New York City 9s Board of Education, as a cschool without walls. According to a Bank Street College of Education paper(https://www.bankstreet.edu/scholarly- initiatives/occasional-paper-series/35/part-i/city-as-school/) on the alternative school 9s history, prospective students were invited to csee the city as your curriculum and to cimagine yourself in various and glamorous-sounding professional settings. , Today, most of the 600 students who attend City-as-School spend about two days per week in traditional classes at its Greenwich Village campus. The other three days, they are involved in internships with one of about 300 organizations 4 from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Marvel Comics. There, the students are supervised by employees of the organization (who themselves go through special training), and also by City-as-School teachers who help their students work through the new and daily challenges of work life. ,  cWe have a very real world context for what they 9re learning, said the principal, Alan Cheng. , And that was what the founders of City-as-School hoped to foster. The practicality and applicability of education are still the goal, as innovative school programs and their partners seek to reimagine the educational system in the 21st century. Or as another sign at the Mayfield Innovation Center reads (this one just outside the drafting and design lab, and attributed to Thomas Edison): , _There is a way to do it better. Find it_.  ",

They tested these on a set of 1,270 photographs of parliamentarians from around the world and found that all three classified lighter faces more accurately than darker ones.

The other two systems had similar gulfs in their performances. Probably, this bias arises from the sets of data the firms concerned used to train their software. Ms Buolamwini and Ms Gebru could not, however, test this because those data sets are closely guarded. IBM has responded quickly. It said it had retrained its system on a new data set for the past year, and that this had greatly improved its accuracy. When testing the new system on an updated version of the set of politicians Ms Buolamwini and Ms Gebru had used, the firm said it now achieved an error rate of 3.46% on dark-skinned female faces 4a tenth of that the two researchers had found using the existing system. For light-skinned males the error rate also fell, to 0.25%. This article appeared in the Science and technology section of the print edition under the headline \"Garbage in. Garbage out\"  ",

            "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress 9s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration 9s efforts to re- examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. , The report(https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-258), issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. , Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported 4 including by black students in affluent schools. , Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration 9s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. , The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. , On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year 4 and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. , Nina Leuzzi, a prekindergarten teacher at a Boston charter school, said she kept her word to her class of 20, predominantly minority 4-year-olds, in making her case to the secretary for why the guidance should stay. When the children asked her why she was traveling to Washington, she told them it was to keep them safe. ,  cRescinding this would send the message that there is no longer a concern about discrimination in our schools, Ms. Leuzzi said. , Nicole Stewart, a former vice principal in San Diego, told Ms. DeVos that pressures to reduce suspensions had made schools dangerous. She said administrators did not expel a student with a knife at her school because he had a disability. Weeks later, he slit a student 9s throat, she said. ,  cIt is no wonder that our kids don 9t think that rules and consequences apply to them, Ms. Stewart said. cWe are not modeling what consequences look like in the real world. , Ms. DeVos is facing new pressures after Republicans linked the guidance(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school- shootings-obama-discipline-policies.html) to the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and President Trump assigned her to lead a school safety commission that will consider whether to repeal the guidance. , Ms. DeVos has declined to say publicly whether she believes that racial bias plays a role in the disproportionate rates at which black students are punished in school. But according to attendees at Wednesday 9s meeting, the secretary opened her remarks by acknowledging that the conversations were taking place on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 9s assassination, and that racial disparities in discipline were a problem in the country. , Evan Stone, co-founder of Educators for Excellence, which represents nearly 30,000 educators across the country, said the acknowledgment gave him hope. cStill, we have a real uphill battle ahead, said Mr. Stone, who attended the meeting with Ms. Leuzzi and five other teachers who are part of the group. , Members of Congress urged Ms. DeVos not to make a decision on the guidance until the G.A.O. report was made public. The Education Department did not issue a response to the G.A.O. findings, as is customary, and did not respond to a request for comment on the report. , The Obama administration guidance was issued based on data that showed that, in 2012, black students were being suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. According to the G.A.O. analysis, in the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school. , The agency also found the disparities for black students started in preschool, and persisted regardless of the type of school they attended 4 disparities were particularly acute in charter schools 4 or the disciplinary action they received. , And black students were the only race in which both boys and girls were disproportionately disciplined across six disciplinary actions examined, which included corporal punishment, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and school-related arrests. , Moreover, the agency found that black students were suspended more often than their white peers in schools of all poverty levels. In the most affluent schools, 7.5 percent of black boys had been given out-of-school suspensions, while 1.8 percent of white boys had. , The finding marks the first time that national discipline rates have been analyzed by poverty level, and challenges a common claim that poverty, more than race, may be driving disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions. , Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles 9s Civil Rights Project, called the finding cgroundbreaking. He said it affirms other research(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class- white-and-black-men.html) that shows that even black boys raised in rich neighborhoods were likely to earn less than their white peers. ,  cThis further shows that poverty is not explaining the disparities, Mr. Losen said. cThere 9s a racial discrimination problem, and that can no longer be disputed. , The G.A.O. analysis was requested by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. , The agency was charged with identifying patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, the challenges that school districts faced with discipline reform, and how the Departments of Education and Justice have addressed the issue through enforcement measures. The investigation took place from November 2016 through March, and included data analysis and interviews with officials in the Education and Justice Departments, as well as district leaders in five states. , The report was praised by Democratic lawmakers as evidence that the 2014 guidance had value. The guidance informed schools that wide racial disparities could signal discriminatory practices that could result in a federal investigation and loss of federal funding. It also suggested a number of strategies for managing nonviolent behavior without resorting to kicking students out of school. ,  cThe G.A.O. 9s first-of-its-kind analysis confirms that racial bias contributes to pervasive discipline disparities, Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler said in a joint statement. cThe G.A.O. 9s findings underscore the need to strengthen the guidance, not rescind it as some have recommended. , But critics who want to see the Obama-era guidance rescinded said the report 9s scope was too narrow to draw broad conclusions. ,  cNone of these findings change the basic story line, said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research organization. cWhat we 9ve learned is discipline reform is being applied unevenly. If you are concerned there are some specific districts and schools that are responding particularly poorly to this, I don 9t think this study gets at that question. , Mr. Petrilli also said the report did not answer the question at the heart of the Obama-guidance criticism: whether racial bias accounted for all the disparities. , The G.A.O. examination illustrated how racial bias was unfolding in some districts. , For instance, at a school district in Kentucky where black students were 10 times as likely as white students to be disciplined, school officials acknowledged that 61 types of violations were undefined, which allowed staff to punish black students more harshly. , In interviews, district officials also reported that they maintained broad discretion in how they disciplined students, and that more serious offenses, like those concerning weapons, violence and drugs, still resulted in removing students from school. , And all of the school districts reported that while they embraced the opportunity to revise their approach to discipline, their biggest barrier was not student behavior. It was the lack of resources to tackle cases of trauma and mental health issues that increasingly plague the nation 9s children.  ",

Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed 2,387 schools would receive money from the \\xa3750m Pupil Equity Funding scheme in 2018-19. Schools in Glasgow will benefit from more than a sixth of the cash. They will receive a total of almost \\xa322m to help fund improvements at 191 schools. The amount of money each school will get is linked to the number of pupils it has receiving free school meals, with the money going directly to head teachers, allowing them to choose how to use the resources.    Mr Swinney announced the allocations to areas and schools ahead of the visit to St Francis RC Primary School in Dundee, where staff used part of the cash they received in 2017-18 to set up six week-long summer schools focused on boosting literacy, numeracy and wellbeing for pupils in the most deprived areas.  'Significant impact' He said: \"Every child should have the best possible start in life, no matter their background. Schools have a significant role to play in ensuring every child is given the right support to help them achieve their full potential. \"Our priority is to close the poverty-related attainment gap. This \\xa3120m of Pupil Equity Funding is aimed at doing just that. \"The funding is targeted towards schools who have the highest numbers of pupils receiving free school meals, so that the money is spent on the children who need it most.\"   He added: \"Last year's allocation is already making a big impact. I have visited a number of schools up and down the country where this funding has empowered teachers to put in place creative new initiatives that are tackling the attainment gap in their schools right now.\" Neil Lowden, head teacher of St Francis RC Primary School, said the cash from the scheme \"has had a significant impact on how I have managed my school in terms of the absolute focus on raising attainment in literacy and numeracy as well as improving outcomes in health and wellbeing for the children in St Francis\". He added: \"As a head teacher, the Pupil Equity Funding has fundamentally allowed our school community to make a real and significant difference to the lives of the children who come through our doors every day.\"  Temporary posts Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), said: \"The identification of funds to those pupils who need support is always helpful but unfortunately, it is replacing other support that has been lost during a continuous programme of education cuts. \"Schools always want to make a difference to those most disadvantaged with additional teachers to assist access to the curriculum and increase inclusion to activities that most other children take for granted. \"The major worry is the sustainability of the funding and the major investment in permanent highly-qualified professionals. \"The current arrangement has seen a large number of temporary posts being created that are not in the interest of the children who need regular and committed professionals to support them through their education journey.\" He added: \"PEP funding is a start but it cannot close, with the present limited funding, the gap to give the most deprived the same education experience as the most advantaged.\" The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said it had concerns about using free school meal claims as the basis for the allocation of funds. Executive director Eileen Prior said: \"We know there is some good work being done with the additional PEF funds but we are keen to see some hard evidence of impact on achievement and attainment.\"   ",

            "article": " HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) is a poorly named department. It usually has few resources other than overworked staff, clunky technology and piles of employee handbooks. Hassled recruiters have to sort through reams of applications that vastly outnumber the jobs available. For example, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), a consumer-goods company, receives 1.2m applications for 25,000 positions every year. AI-enabled systems can scan applications far more quickly than humans and work out whether candidates are a good fit. Oddly enough, they may also inject more humanity into hiring. According to Athena Karp of HiredScore, a startup that uses algorithms to screen candidates for J&J and others, only around 15-20% of applicants typically hold the right qualifications for a job, but they are rarely told why they were not hired, nor are they pointed to more suitable jobs. Technology is helping cgive respect back to candidates d, she says.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Nvidia, a chipmaker, also gets more r\\xe9sum\\xe9s than it can comfortably cope with, so it spent a year building its own system to predict which candidates are worth interviewing. It has recognised patterns that recruiters might not: for example, candidates who submit especially long r\\xe9sum\\xe9s turn out to do less well than others, so those extra words will count against them. Hilton, a hotel chain, has shortened the average time it takes to hire a candidate from 42 days to five with the help of HireVue, a startup. It analyses videos of candidates answering questions and uses AI to judge their verbal skills, intonation and gestures. This can be especially helpful when the candidate comes from a different culture or speaks another first language, says Ellyn Shook, chief leadership and HR officer of Accenture, a consultancy with 435,000 employees that also uses HireVue. Employers tend to hire candidates who are like themselves, which makes for undiversified workplaces. Orchestras, for example, used to be mostly male. Recruitment of female musicians went up only when they introduced cblind auditions behind a screen. Algorithms can act as virtual screens, making hiring fairer. Pymetrics, a startup whose clients include companies such as Unilever, a consumer-goods giant, and Nielsen, a research firm, offers a set of games for candidates to play, usually at an early stage of the recruitment process, that ignore factors such as gender, race and level of education. Instead they test candidates for some 80 traits such as memory and attitude to risk. Pymetrics then uses machine learning to measure applicants against top performers and predict their suitability for a role. This can help candidates without conventional qualifications. Another firm that is helping companies become more diverse is Textio, a startup that uses AI to improve job descriptions. For example, it has found that corporate jargon like cstakeholders and csynergies tend to drive away certain candidates, especially non-whites, and that women are less likely to apply for a job that is described as cmanaging than cdeveloping a team. Tweaking job descriptions can get 25% more qualified people through the door and boost recruitment among minorities, says Kieran Snyder, Textio 9s boss.

In the past, there was no way of redirecting them to other jobs as they became available. AI will make it possible to crepurpose candidates we have attracted before d, says Sjoerd Gehring, vice-president of talent acquisition for J&J. The health-care giant uses HiredScore, a startup, to grade candidates. When a vacancy opens up, the system automatically generates a shortlist of candidates that could be a good fit. This will bring big cost savings, says Mr Gehring. AI can also help with managing employees. HR professionals and recruiters at big firms cannot possibly know all their own talented workers across countries and departments, says Chris Louie of Nielsen. His company is using AI to improve internal mobility. Twine Labs, a startup that is working with Nielsen, suggests internal candidates for new roles, based on employee data and job requirements, taking in hundreds of variables. Around half the candidates it suggests are approved and promoted, says Joseph Quan, Twine Labs 9 boss. That is about the same success rate as for a human recruiter. Another use for AI is to help employers reduce staff turnover. On average, replacing a worker takes around 20% of annual salary, sometimes much more. Workday, a software firm, has started to predict how likely employees are to leave. It looks at around 60 factors 4such as pay, time between holidays taken and turnover in managers to whom the employee reports 4and flags those at risk of quitting so companies can try to retain them. Arena, a startup that works with hospitals and care-home companies, where turnover is high, considers retention even before it takes someone on. By using data from job applications and third parties to predict which applicants are likely to stay for more than a year, Arena has reduced its clients 9 median turnover by 38%, says Michael Rosenbaum, Arena 9s boss. In future AI may also be used to determine pay. Infosys is looking into using AI to decide when to give employees a rise, based on their performance and their pay relative to that of colleagues. The technology will make pay fairer by taking biases and personality traits out of consideration, says Sudhir Jha, head of product management and strategy at Infosys. But there is a risk that workers will try to game the system. All this points to a broader issue in AI: transparency. Companies will need to ensure that algorithms are being constantly monitored. In America, where it is illegal to discriminate against protected groups such as racial minorities, firms must be able to prove that they are hiring from these groups roughly in proportion to the population and are not introducing any bias, says Mr Rosenbaum. Startup bosses say they offer their clients transparency and regularly check their algorithms to make sure they are free of bias. But as AI becomes more prevalent, concerns will grow that algorithms could reinforce discrimination. Recruitment is just one example of the technological disruption that AI will bring to the workforce. The number of recruiters will come down, because AI will handle many of the mundane tasks they used to do, and face-to-face interviews will become rarer. At Unilever only shortlisted candidates are now interviewed, after several rounds of AI-enabled screening and recorded interviews through HireVue. For the remaining recruiters, though, AI will make work easier and more interesting. It may even help some of the workers it displaces. Accenture is rolling out a custom-built tool called Job Buddy which tells employees how vulnerable their job is to automation and predicts what training they might need so they can develop the right skills for the future. Ms Shook of Accenture says that around 80% of the people who have tried it are taking the advice it offers. But they may not have much choice.

Ahmed deserved better from the legal system. If the case had proceeded through the full discovery process of sharing documents and taking depositions, we could have learned more about the details of Ahmed's treatment by school administrators and police officers as well as the broader climate facing students of color in the school district. !Hoboken mayor: Diversity is an American value (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Hoboken mayor: Diversity is an American value (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171108135551-election-wins- large-169.jpg)(/2017/11/21/opinions/hoboken-mayor-diversity-american-value- bhalla-opinion/index.html) Hoboken mayor: Diversity is an American value (/2017/11/21/opinions/hoboken- mayor-diversity-american-value-bhalla-opinion/index.html) Yet the court in Texas bypassed a deeper exploration of these issues by dismissing the case. This isn't a loss for Ahmed alone, but for all black and brown students who are experiencing the impact of punitive treatment within their school walls and a climate of bigotry outside of them. Discriminatory disciplinary practices targeting black students has become a national crisis as the Department of Education has found(https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/data.html) that black students are three more times more likely to be suspended than white students are. Black girls are acutely affected and are being suspended(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__ocrdata.ed .gov_downloads_crdc-2Dschool-2Ddiscipline- 2Dsnapshot.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=EP_9DVc9-CC6-Uhr9NMVzplbR4yw2-lmr0_XL7FfdBo&e=) at higher rates than any other girls of color. Students from Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian communities also face challenges because they are viewed as suspicious and dangerous in the post-9/11 environment. And, in the wake of Ahmed's encounter, other Muslim students reported(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mic .com_articles_125446_meet-2Dthe-2Dmuslim-2Dstudents-2Dwho-2Dhave-2Dbeen- 2Dharassed-2Dat-2Dschool-2Dfor-2Dless-2Dthan-2Da- 2Dclock-23.tsHOWCDJf&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=2KCFb_zuLj1Oz1ziFkw8Z8Fw7efHOdSk53f3zYYWa0g&e=) being targeted by anti-violent extremism initiatives at their schools, dragged out by school security personnel and suspended for minor infractions.

School administrators and educators must be cognizant of the racial realities that young people encounter daily. And the legal system must take seriously the complaints of young people of color who face police brutality, stop and frisk, deportations and the school- to-prison pipeline. Otherwise, young people will confront challenges ranging from achievement and wage gaps to isolation to a sense that they just don't belong in America. We can and must do better to address the racial realities that young people face in America today, and there are a few concrete steps we can take. School officials must heed the recommendations of organizations such as the Advancement Project(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https- 3A__advancementproject.org_resources_taking-2Drestorative-2Dpractices- 2Dschool- 2Dwide_&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=j9XBWD8Kjxl6XZHxQst3HqCbIfSb6wHegqdvfQx83zc&e=), a multiracial civil rights group, and Desis Rising Up and Moving,(http://www.drumnyc.org/institutionalizedbullying/) which organizes low-wage South Asian workers and youth in New York City, by focusing on opportunities for collaborative problem-solving rather than simply relying on punitive disciplinary measures. Schools must set and evaluate equity benchmarks to close the achievement gap that often widens when children of color are suspended or expelled. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Students and teachers should receive ongoing anti-racist training and address the consequences of systemic racism and intergenerational trauma through inclusive curricula and honest dialogues. School counselors must provide culturally specific services and resources to children who feel targeted to strengthen their mental well-being and self-esteem. Parent-teacher associations and school boards must ensure that schools remain places of sanctuary and refuge for students. And students must be supported so they can organize, dissent and raise their voices. There was a simple reason why Americans responded with compassion and outrage when they first heard about Ahmed Mohamed. The legal system may ignore the culture of anti-black and anti-Muslim bias that pervades our school systems and country.

Calculations for the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) put Hull University(http://www.hull.ac.uk/Home.aspx) top for admitting a balanced intake of rich and poor students. Institutions like Cambridge, St Andrews, Bristol and Oxford were placed near the bottom of the table. Cambridge welcomed \"different interpretations of the data\". However, a spokesman for the university pointed out that the HEPI analysis relies on a single measure, adding \"widening participation in higher education is a complex issue\".      * I missed out on university but my son won't(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43084674)   * Wealthy students tighten university grip(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42339106)  Last year the charity Teach First compared official child poverty figures with university participation rates and found young people in some of the wealthiest areas of England were 18 times more likely(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40898523) to go to university than those in the poorest. Another analysis showed four fifths of students accepted at Oxford and Cambridge(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41664459) between 2010 and 2015 had parents in top professional and managerial jobs.  Neighbourhood chances Each year, admissions figures(http://www.hefce.ac.uk/analysis/yp/POLAR/), known as Participation of Local Areas (Polar), divide neighbourhoods into five groups, according to the proportion of young people going to university. In a perfect world each university would take a fifth of its students from each group, says HEPI. For this study, statisticians used the 2016 Polar data to rank each of the UK's 132 universities in terms of how near they came to this target. The resulting table turns the usual university rankings upside down.  Top 10 universities for class equality   * Hull   * Derby   * Edge Hill   * Chester   * Plymouth College of Art   * York St John   * Leeds Beckett   * Worcester   * Anglia Ruskin   * Cardiff Metropolitan  Bottom 10 universities for class equality   * Cambridge   * St Andrews   * Bristol   * Oxford   * Aberdeen   * Edinburgh   * UCL   * Durham   * Robert Gordon   * LSE   Image copyrightUniversity of Hull Prof Iain Martin, report author and Anglia Ruskin vice-chancellor, said that despite ongoing efforts to boost equal access to higher education: \"We do not have an educational level playing field.\" Nick Hillman, director of HEPI, added: \"This analysis reveals which universities reflect our society best and those which have further to travel.\" He said learning outcomes were better when students from diverse backgrounds studied alongside each other. \"The best way to deliver fairer access to selective institutions is the same as the best way to deliver widening participation overall, which is to provide more places,\" he added. Cambridge University said the Polar data takes no account of household income or access to education and \"effectively assumes that people living on the same street have the same likelihood of entering higher education as their neighbours\". The spokesman said Cambridge:   * Runs outreach programmes across the UK to raise aspirations among under-represented and disadvantaged groups   * Uses multiple measures to assess every applicant's educational and socio-economic background   * In 2017 had the highest level (63%) of state school applicants for 35 years and over 20% of students describe themselves as being from an ethnic minority.  A spokesman for the Russell Group, which represents several institutions near the bottom of the table, said members were \"fully committed to encouraging students from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter and succeed in higher education\".

Although there is something particular in the overt discrimination practiced toward Marina, the movie bridges language and cultural barriers, striking an emotional chord with the universal nature of its themes. It's worth noting, too, that the small, intimate approach to the story makes this a movie that will play perfectly well on TV, which is where many people will no doubt catch up with it.

            "article": " In 2005, Gerry Adams went to South Africa. After landing in Johannesburg, he laid a wreath at Freedom Park before driving to the University of Witwatersrand to make a speech.  At that point, he'd been the leader of the Irish nationalist party, Sinn Fein, for 22 years. It was a party Nelson Mandela(https://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/nelson-mandela-nation- father-20126254044646548.html) described as \"an old friend and ally\", and this was one of several visits to South Africa by Gerry Adams that aimed to burnish his moral credentials as a peacemaker.  Waiting at the university was a BBC journalist who had scheduled an interview with the politician, and was struggling to find an interesting angle on a story about a man made famous in a conflict that had long since ceased to be \"top of the bulletin\"\\xa0material.  The interview started politely as Adams related his time in South Africa, and then the BBC journalist changed tack. Pointing to the African National Congress' (ANC)\\xa0largely peaceful overthrow of the apartheid regime, he asked Adams if he felt Mandela's party enjoyed a kind of moral legitimacy that Sinn Fein never would.   !(/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/2af8c6073e334a8fa49b5e130de87cf8_18.jpg)  ---  South African President Nelson Mandela meets with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in 1995 at the African National Congress headquarters in Johannesburg Juda Ngwenya/Reuters     He was, of course, referring to Sinn Fein being the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), an organisation responsible for killing more than 1,700 people.  It was an abrupt and unwelcome confrontation between two sides of Adams' persona, two epochs of his life: the defender of violence, and the man of peace. The politician responded by suggesting bias on the part of the BBC; the interview went cold, ended awkwardly, and was never broadcast.  Adams will soon step down as leader of Sinn Fein after 35 years at the helm. In that time, he has catapulted the party out of political obscurity.  Last year, Sinn Fein came within one seat of shredding the domination of pro- British political parties in Northern Ireland, a feat that could very well have resulted in a referendum on ending British rule there.  This success was built on the back of a negotiated settlement that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, a settlement in which Gerry Adams played a large part. As political resumes go, it's an impressive one.   A 'significant' figure  Former IRA man Tommy McKearney is not a cheerleader for Adams. Nonetheless, he describes him as \"one of the most significant major figures in Irish political life over the last 40 years, whether one likes or dislikes him\".  Adams' significance comes from him having persuaded the IRA to give up the use of armed force and to replace it with constitutional politics to achieve a united Ireland. This is a point even his unionist opponents acknowledge.  Ben Lowry, deputy editor of the Northern Irish unionist daily newspaper, the News Letter, says: \"He definitely steered the IRA, over a long period of time from the early 1980s until the late 1990s, away from violence.\"  Born into a poor family in west Belfast in 1948, Adams became involved in nationalist politics in the 1960s.   !(/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/79ca2363265a491aacacd03b1ea92679_18.jpg)  ---  Gerry Adams with Christy Burke, Sinn Fein's candidate in Dublin Central, in 1983 Independent News and Media/Getty Images     By his early adolescence, Northern Ireland had been run for 40 years by the Ulster Unionists, pro-British and almost entirely Protestant.  Injustices against Catholics, including discrimination in the allocation of housing and unequal voting rights, gave rise to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. Adams signed up to the organisation in 1967.  Two years later, a cocktail of political turmoil pushed this small region of the UK, containing just 1.5 million people, over a cliff.  Sectarian rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Belfast and Londonderry prompted a plea from the government for British troops on the ground. The troops were at first welcomed by Irish nationalists and Catholics as protectors, but quickly became the target of IRA gunmen, who saw them as illegitimate enforcers of British occupation.  The decades-long conflict that followed saw the Provisional IRA emerge as a deadly force that killed thousands of policemen, soldiers and civilians, as well as senior figures in the British government, almost claiming the life of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher(https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2013/04/20134814012127352.html).   Deadly hunger strikes  Gerry Adams spent the 1970s being variously interned and arrested for alleged IRA activity but has always denied being a member.  It was the events of 1981 that gave rise to his political career.  That was the year that 10 IRA prisoners starved themselves to death, using a hunger strike to demand political status that the British government refused to grant.  The outpouring of emotion that followed encouraged the Sinn Fein leadership to seek an electoral mandate that would back up their claims of widespread support for British withdrawal and Irish unification.  They would proceed, in the words of one activist, \"with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other\".\\xa0   !(/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/dd04213287b14b79b441b92189861187_18.jpg)  ---  Martin McGuiness and Gerry Adams pictured in 1985 Independent News And Media/Getty Images     Adams took over the leadership in 1983 and put that strategy into action.  McKearney was one of those who participated in a lesser known hunger strike in 1980.  Adams, he says, did not conceive of the strategy independently, but cultivated it and persuaded others.  \"The argument was being made through the 80s that there had to be an alternative,\" he says. \"The IRA, Sinn Fein and the republican movement, in general, has a political objective, and decisions were made pragmatically and rationally about how best to advance that political agenda.  \"Once it was deemed important to defend that position with arms and then the decision was taken to move away from arms, it wasn't useful any longer, and the movement was persuaded of that by Gerry and others.\"  What began as a dual strategy evolved over the course of the 1980s into a view among many in Sinn Fein that continued violence was pointless.  Some of this was likely motivated by the very successful efforts of British intelligence to undermine the IRA through a network of informers.  McKearney does not refer to this, but does describe the British state as a \"very strong and determined enemy\", and admits that \"some options were closed down and others opened up\".  Something of a window of opportunity for peace negotiations was opened in the 1990s. By the end of that decade, Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness had persuaded their party to enter into an agreement that would eventually see the IRA end its armed campaign and decommission its weapons in return for the release of prisoners and political representation in the government of Northern Ireland.  Gerry Adams, a man whose voice had been banned on British television four years earlier, now occupied an office in Stormont, formerly the seat of unionist power.  But observers point to a contradiction in that success. How, they ask, could Adams have so successfully controlled a notorious paramilitary group of which he has consistently denied ever being a member?  Since the peace agreement in 1998, Adams has been plagued by accusations from unionists and nationalists alike that he not only joined but helped to lead the IRA in the worst years of Northern Ireland's violence.  In 2014 he was questioned for four days by Northern Irish police in connection with the 1972 murder of a single mother of 10 children. He was released without charge.   'He can't tell the truth from lies'  There are those who excoriate Adams' record, and among them is former IRA member Shane Paul O'Doherty. Since spending a decade and a half in jail for his part in a letter-bombing campaign, O'Doherty has renounced violence entirely.  He calls Adams a \"strategist, full of charisma, a great cult leader, he has people who will follow him to hell\", but, he says, \"at this stage in his career he can't tell truth from lies\".  Editor Lowry says: \"Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community\".  Adams' characteristic opacity has fuelled speculation over his past. He is, says Lowry, \"mysterious, hard to read, inscrutable\". For unionists, that's disconcerting, especially since Adams is a man who gets results; for those who support him, it breeds respect.  > Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community.\\r > > Ben Lowry, News Letter\\xa0deputy editor > >   Even in the twilight years of his political career, Adams has continued to evolve and grow in stature.  He gave up his place in Northern Ireland's assembly to campaign for and win a seat in the Dail - the elected legislature of the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein is now the third largest political force in the Republic.  The party's future lies in consolidating its position on both sides of the Irish border; a future bought for it by the leadership of Gerry Adams.\\xa0  Most commentators believe Adams will remain an essential figure to his party behind the scenes, inhabiting a perhaps familiar position, in the shadows.

            "article": " MELBOURNE, Australia 4 At Lumineer Academy, a newly opened primary school in Williamstown, Australia, there is no homework. There are no classrooms, uniforms or traditional grades. , Instead, there are ccreator spaces, cblue-sky thinking sessions and cpitch decks. , If the school 4 furnished like a start-up with whiteboards and beanbag chairs 4 sounds like the idea of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, that 9s because it is. , That entrepreneur is Susan Wu, 44, an American who has been called one of the cmost influential women in technology(https://www.fastcompany.com/3017162/the-most-influential-women-in- technology-2010-susan-wu) and who has advised or invested in companies that include Twitter, Reddit and Stripe. , Ms. Wu and her team believe they are starting an education revolution. They say they have created a new model for teaching children, called Luminaria(http://www.luminaria.org/), that promises to prepare them to become the architects of 4 rather than mere participants in 4 a future world. ,  cOur current school models were built 100-plus years ago for the Industrial Revolution, said Ms. Wu. cWhat they cared about were homogeneous factories that produced a template of a kind of worker. The world has changed. , Critics, however, see Lumineer Academy(http://www.lumineer.edu.au/) as another in a series of attempts by Silicon Valley(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/technology/tech-billionaires- education-zuckerberg-facebook-hastings.html) to apply the same techniques used to churn out successful apps to instead turn out successful children. , In the United States, as more tech executives have tried their hands at opening schools, education experts have debated, and in some cases warned about, the effects of corporate money and influence(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/silicon-valley- baltimore-schools.html) pervading the classroom. , In recent years, schools and education programs have been founded by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla; Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; and Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce. , Despite glittering launches and promises to disrupt education, schools founded by tech executives have yet to demonstrate success. AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000. , Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school 9s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart. , Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools 4 nearly three times the rate of American children 4 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit. , Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education. , Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education 4 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria. , Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu 9s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school. ,  cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time, said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. cAlmost any problem space 4 no matter how different it is from the last 4 she seems to be able to tackle. , Lumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000. , Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.) , Classrooms in the school have been rebranded cstudios. There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working. , The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases. , Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums. ,  cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, 8This can 9t be true, 9 said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they 9re quite prescriptive. , Ms. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn 9t joined Ms. Wu 9s school. ,  cI felt like I was too restricted, she said. cI couldn 9t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them. , There is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school. In one studio, 8- and 9-year-olds worked on a project about socializing. The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up 9s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch. , Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas. ,  cI was kind of impressed with the number of clich\\xe9s and buzzwords that they packed into a short amount of marketing copy, said Audrey Watters, whose blog, Hack Education(http://hackeducation.com/), analyzes the intersection of education and tech. cIn the case of Luminaria, they have everything, they have all the buzzwords: social and emotional learning, mind- sets, grit, S.T.E.M., mindfulness, authentic learning, global consciousness. I mean, pick two of those. , Glenn Savage, an Australian education policy expert, said that it was difficult to see how the school 9s lofty goals could fit within Australia 9s cvery structured education system. ,  cIt 9s important that parents don 9t work on the false assumption that sending students to a school that claims to do things radically different means that the students won 9t be doing anything like students in other schools 4 because that 9s just not the case, he said. , One wall at the school displayed students 9 work with the Asylum Seeker(https://www.asrc.org.au/) Resource Center(https://www.asrc.org.au/), a nonprofit organization that assists refugees hoping to resettle in Australia. , The students had created a cpitch deck 4 tech jargon for a PowerPoint presentation 4 aimed at persuading the group to collaborate with them on a project (it worked). In a nearby ccreator space, students were working to build a profitable micro-farm. They have been assigned to grow and sell goods at the local farmers 9 market by the end of the school year. , One student, Ines Morgan, 8, said she particularly liked a project in which her class observed an ant colony. ,  cOur hypothesis was, 8What happens when an ant colony gets disrupted? 9 she explained. cThey lived in chaos for like a day or two, but then, a few days later, they stuck together and just all decided to rebuild again. , The school 9s website promises to remove the cstress and anxiety students encounter at other schools. , But if students are shielded from emotional adversity in their early years, critics say, they may struggle to cope when they reach high school 4 where desks, traditional teaching methods and puberty await. , Ines, the 8-year-old ant colony disrupter, said she had seen ca little bit of bullying but that it was dealt with as a collective. , When asked how the situation was resolved, another student, Noah Helu, 8, said, cWell, it 9s like what Ines learned about the ant colony: Sticking together helped us stop the bullying.

The local authority said other cuts being considered would affect services such as behaviour support and English as an additional language. The details are in a letter sent from the council to head teachers. In a statement, Highland Council said a \"wide range of proposals\" were being considered to help it make savings. The local authority's Independent-Lib Dem-Labour administration is having to tackle an estimated budget gap of \\xa325.8m in the coming financial year due what it what it calls the \"scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years\".     Cuts 'appalling' SNP councillor and former Dingwall Academy rector, Graham MacKenzie, has described the council's proposed cuts as \"appalling\" and said they would \"worsen\" the attainment gap in the Highlands. Teaching union the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said it would be concerned if the council pushed ahead with the proposals. In the letter, the council said reductions in additional support needs teachers and pupil support assistants had been proposed. However, it added that vacancies and the turnover in these roles were \"likely to protect all those presently in post\". Also proposed is a reduction in specialist additional support services, excluding NHS Highland-funded services. The letter said: \"This is likely to impact in educational psychology, behaviour support, English as an additional language, interrupted learning, autism, assistive technology, and pre-school support services.\" About 40 teaching posts could also be cut. This would affect medium-sized and larger secondary schools.  'Remain committed' Other possible savings outlined include having fewer crossing patrol personnel and \"significantly\" reducing funding to Inverness' Eden Court Theatre and to High Life Highland, which operates council-owned leisure centres, museums and libraries. The proposals will be considered by councillors on 15 February. In its statement, Highland Council said: \"We have managed to protect education in previous years, and there were no new saving measures for schools last year. \"But the scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years means it is no longer possible to sustain that level of protection. \"We remain committed to supporting education and maintaining teacher numbers as far as we can, and especially for primary schools and rural communities.\" It added \"Other councils have made savings on additional need services in previous years, and we are now having to consider that. \"Other than this, there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in 90% of Highland schools, as we will protect all primary schools and our smaller secondary schools.\" Alistair Bell, Highlands secretary of the EIS, said that while the details set out in the letter were only proposals at this stage they were still a cause for concern. He told BBC Radio Scotland: \"If this is what is going to happen it is a grave situation for what is already a stretched service. \"At a time when the Scottish government is asking teachers in schools to bridge the attainment gap, this can only hinder that process.\"   ",

Zeman, 73, is a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an early fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and campaigned by warning against Muslim migrants in a country with tiny religious minorities. His challenger, a 68 -year-old chemistry professor, vowed to creturn dignity to the post, a reference to Zeman 9s frequent clashes with media and political rivals. Opinion polls signaled a close race before the two-day runoff. Voting will resume at 8 a.m. and last until 2 p.m. Saturday, with results expected in the afternoon. The Czech Republic boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU, the lowest unemployment in the bloc and the highest living standards among its post-communist members. Still, Zeman has tapped anti-establishment sentiment that boosted populist politicians that challenged the EU 9s liberal, multi-cultural values elsewhere across the continent in elections last year. While the president has a largely ceremonial role, the post serves as an influential voice in public debate.      cCzech society is very divided, said Balazs Jarabik, a scholar at Carnegie Europe. cThe urban elites should show a bit more understanding toward rural voters. They really do have totally different possibilities. And the differences are only growing. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ3Z.QCPsoL4/v0/60x-1.jpg) Jiri Drahos, left, and Milos Zeman during a television debate on Jan. 23.

Zeman has already pledged to give Babis a second chance(/news/terminal/P2Z5U5SYF01S \"Czech President Zeman Sticks to Plan to Name Babis Premier Again\") to form a cabinet regardless of the outcome of the presidential election. Babis and his ANO party endorsed the incumbent before the presidential election.

Critics say his pro-Russian and anti-migrant rhetoric, jokes about killing journalists, vegetarians and teetotalers and his support of extremist political forces including a far-right party that advocates leaving the EU, have undermined the authority of the presidency. Zeman calls himself a euro-federalist, but he also suggested that Czech Republic should hold a Brexit-style referendum to leave the EU. He said he 9d vote to stay in although people should have a choice.     During the campaign, the incumbent accused Drahos of being soft on refugees. His supporters ran a full-page add in Pravo newspaper on Thursday that said cStop the migrants and Drahos. This country is ours. While Drahos said the Czech Republic ccan handle some 2,600 refugees, he also opposes the EU 9s quotas for migrants.   ",

Four of seven targets to improve disadvantage aren 9t being met, which is still the best result since 2011, the government 9s annual Closing the Gap report(https://closingthegap.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/ctg- report-2018.pdf?a=1 \"Link to Report\") on Monday showed. In a bid to help erase economic disparity, indigenous businesses had received more than A$1 billion ($780 million) in government-commissioned contracts since 2015, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.  cWe cannot close the gap if we do not have equal participation in the economy, Turnbull told parliament.     The report shows where Australia stands in its bid to end differences in health care, education, and job opportunities between the nation 9s 650,000 Aborigines and other Australians, about 230 years after European settlement. Indigenous Australians populated the continent at least 50,000 years ago and make up about 3 percent of the population. The program, initiated by then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2008, has sometimes struggled for momentum due to changes in government leadership. Over the eight years to 2016, about A$23.8 billion was spent through the program to improve conditions for the indigenous, the Australian newspaper reported on Monday.  Measures On Target:   ---    * Halve the gap in mortality rates for indigenous children under five by 2018     * 95 percent of all indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025\\xa0     * Halve the gap for indigenous Australians aged 20-24 in Year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates by 2020     Measures Not On Target:   ---    * Close the gap in life expectancy by 2031     * Close the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous school attendance by 2018     * Halve the gap for indigenous children in reading, writing and numeracy achievements by 2018     * Halve the gap in employment outcomes between indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018       ",

The Brilliant Club(http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/) is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal. In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15. In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.  University gap This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.     Image caption Pupils get extra lessons with postgraduate students, showing them university is in reach  The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%. Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome. In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and \"classrooms fit for purpose\". In Philippi, she says: \"The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT information and communications technology. \"With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa.\" Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.  Image caption Putting young people in the frame for university  While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the \"academic and social skills\" needed to complete their degrees. But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons. The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking. In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and see, perhaps for the first time, what it's like to be a student and to show that it's an accessible target.  Unequal chances It's a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.  Image caption When pupils complete the course, they go on a visit to university to find about life as a student  University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education. Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year. But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered. Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university. \"Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement,\" says the impact report on AccessEd's pilot phase. But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal. * * * More from Global education(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * Liberia's big school experiment(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * Helping to keep girls in school in India(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * Terror survivor campaigns for open speech(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the Global education series(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

The move has been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney in a bid to tackle a recruitment crisis in the profession. The Scottish government said it was providing \\xa31.3m to create hundreds more opportunities for people to qualify as teachers. Edinburgh's Queen Margaret and Napier universities will train new recruits from 2019. Mr Swinney said the government was addressing difficulties recruiting classroom staff and he hoped this would \"build capacity within teacher education\".    It comes as the EIS teaching union warned schools are facing a recruitment \"crisis\" - with this one of the reasons why they are demanding a 10% wage rise for teachers.  'Raising standards' Edinburgh Napier University will initially offer a total of 30 places on a one-year Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) course - which allows those who already have a degree to train as teachers - with a focus on maths and sciences. It is planned to expand that into areas such as English and computing, with up to 150 training places after three years. Queen Margaret University will recruit up to 120 students to an undergraduate primary course but will also have 20 places on a PGDE course for those who wish to be home economics teachers.  Image caption The move could create hundreds of new teachers  Mr Swinney said: \"Teachers have a key role to play in helping us raise standards and close the attainment gap. That is why we are doing everything we can to attract talented and enthusiastic people to the profession. \"We recognise that, in common with many other countries, it is hard to recruit teachers in the numbers we need, particularly in certain specialist subjects. \"Adding two additional universities to the institutions that offer initial teacher education, supported by \\xa31.3 million investment from the Scottish Government, means we can not only recruit additional teachers to take up post within the next two years but build capacity within teacher education. \"The two new teacher training courses offer more choice and flexibility for anyone considering teaching as a career, especially in the specialist home economic and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects where we know there are shortages at the moment.\"  'By teachers, for teachers' Kenneth Muir, chief executive and registrar of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, hailed the move as a \"landmark development in the provision of initial teacher education\". He added: \"We must continue to adapt to ensure we do not miss out to other professions on new, high quality teaching talent. \"It is important that high standards are maintained and we will ensure the courses offered by QMU and Napier universities satisfy fully our accreditation criteria.\" Alistair Sambell, vice principal and deputy vice chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, said: \"Our new teacher education programme will be designed by teachers, for teachers. \"As a university we have an applied approach to learning, and student placements in schools will be underpinned by practice-based learning in class, supported by practising teachers.\" Prof Petra Wend, principal of Queen Margaret University, added: \"Teacher education at QMU will offer research-informed, practice-based programmes developed in collaboration with professionals from the sector and inspired by the needs of Scottish children and schools today.\"   ",

He talked face to face with his young patients, often sitting on the floor and playing with them. ,  cHe enjoyed kids and he dealt with them in a wondrous way, Dr. David Mandelbaum, a former student of Dr. Gold 9s at Columbia who is a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the Brown University Alpert Medical School, said in a telephone interview. cHe always sensed what a kid was able to do, not what he couldn 9t do. , He was also concerned with the patients 9 parents, spending time, for example, to understand the effects that a neurologically damaged child 9s condition had on their marriage and finances. And if he could not give them hope, he gave them answers. ,  cHe told me the worst news in the most loving way, Amy Gleicher said in a telephone interview, recalling Dr. Gold 9s diagnosis concerning her year-old son, Max, in 1993. cHe told me my son was mentally retarded in such a way that I had dignity and my child had value. , Dr. Gold continued his humane approach as advances like M.R.I. 9s and CT scans revolutionized medicine. But he became distressed in the 1970s and 980s, he said, as he watched students and other doctors become too focused on technology and not enough on the people they were treating. ,  cSo one day in 1988, he said in the 2016 interview, cI was making rounds with the students and residents and a student presented me 8the brain tumor in 209. 9 And I said: 8The brain tumor? Isn 9t there a child involved in this? Tell me about the child, tell me about the family. Tell me how this is impacting on the family. Do you know any of this? 9 They did not, he said. , At home that night, he told his wife of his concerns about where medicine was headed. As he recalled, she told him, cYou know, Arnold, I 9m tired of you griping about medicine. _Do_ something about it or shut up. , They began the Arnold P. Gold Foundation together in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in 1988, hoping to clone Dr. Gold 9s humane approach to patient engagement. They started white-coat ceremonies at medical schools(http://www .gold-foundation.org/what-do-medical-students-hope-to-remember-about-their- white-coat-ceremony/) in which students pledge the Hippocratic oath in the early days of their education, rather than at graduation, as is common practice. Dr. Gold felt that graduation was too late to set expectations for the clinicians they would become. ,  cThis should be established at Day 1, he said in the interview. , Arnold Perlman Gold was born in Manhattan on Aug. 8, 1925. His father, Michael, a Jewish native of Dublin, and his mother, the former Rebecca Perlman, were lawyers. As a youngster, Arnold read cArrowsmith, Sinclair Lewis 9s 1925 novel about a doctor 9s search for truth. ,  cArnold was very idealistic and wanted to save the world, said Dr. Brian Benson, Dr. Gold 9s son-in-law, cand he was very impacted by that book. , In 1938, when Arnold was 13, his father died, and his mother sent him to live with an aunt in Galveston, Tex., believing that he might get a better chance at an education there. He attended the University of Texas, Austin, but left to serve stateside in World War II as a Navy corpsman. , He later graduated from the University of Texas, studied for a master 9s at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and earned his medical degree from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. , During his internship at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Dr. Gold tended to 30 children with polio who were in iron lungs. His mentor there, Dr. Margaret Smith, ctaught me a lot about patient-centered care, and she also led me into the field of pediatrics, he said in 2016. ,  cI was originally going to be an internist, an endocrinologist, he said. , When he was chief resident at Cincinnati Children 9s Hospital, part of his work placed him in Dr. Albert Sabin 9s laboratory while Dr. Sabin(http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0826.html \"His obituary.\") was developing the oral polio vaccine. While in Cincinnati, Dr. Gold rode horseback for the Frontier Nursing Service to treat people in rural Kentucky. , He returned to New York as visiting chief resident at the Babies Hospital(http://www.nyp.org/morganstanley/about-us/history) at the NewYork Presbyterian-Columbia University campus (now Morgan Stanley Children 9s Hospital) before beginning his long career at Columbia in child neurology. , Dr. Gold lived with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which affected his muscles later in his life and made it difficult for him to breathe. He treated patients until he was 88 and spoke at last year 9s white-coat ceremony at the(http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2017/08/14/ps-community-welcomes- class-2021-white-coat-ceremony/) College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia. , Besides his wife, the former Sandra Orenberg, who has a doctorate in counseling, he is survived by two daughters, Amelia Gold and Maggie Gold Seelig; a stepdaughter, Jennifer Arnold; a stepson, Stephen Silver; and 13 grandchildren. His stepson Jeffrey Silver died(http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/community-mourns-passing-of- pure-soul/) in 2010. , Dr. Gold recalled that in creating his foundation, his goal was to change the course of medical education. ,  cMy colleagues were very distressed, he recalled in the 2016 interview. cThey looked at me as sort of, 8What 9s happening to Arnold? 9 And one of them even said to me, 8I think you 9re smoking opium, 9 and, 8How could you ever believe that you can change medicine? 9 People were not very encouraging. , But 30 years later, the foundation said, more than 170 medical schools and physician assistant programs hold white-coat ceremonies annually. More than 260 nursing schools hold similar gatherings. , The foundation has also inducted 30,000 students, residents and faculty into its Gold Humanism Honor Society to recognize their compassionate patient care. The designation became prestigious enough for medical students to include it in applications for residencies. , Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, the president and chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said in an email that the honor society cdemonstrates that, increasingly, the medical profession recognizes humanistic attributes such as empathy and compassion as being every bit as important as academic achievement. , He added, cThis is just one more element of Dr. Gold 9s outstanding legacy.

But economists, surely, inhabit planet Earth, surveying it dispassionately. Alas, a new paper suggests that even dismal scientists divide on gender lines. Ann Mari May and Mary McGarvey of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and David Kucera of the International Labour Organisation surveyed economists from 18 European countries, and found that differences in the wider population can survive even an economics education. Male economists are more likely than female ones to prefer market solutions to government intervention, are more sceptical of environmental protection, and are (slightly) less keen on redistribution (see chart).  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Women were 14 percentage points less likely to agree that Walmart generates net benefits, and 30 points more likely to agree that American openness to trade should be tied to higher labour standards abroad. Perhaps the divergence does not matter. Good economics should, after all, involve using theory and data to quell prejudices. But some evidence suggests that ideology seeps into economists 9 work. Zubin Jelveh of the University of Chicago, Suresh Naidu of Columbia University and Bruce Kogut of Columbia Business School parse the language used in economics papers to identify the authors 9 predilections, and confirm that they match their participation in political petitions. They find that right-wing economists tend to produce estimates that fit their anti-interventionist views. Other data crunched by Mr Naidu confirm that women use more left-leaning language than men. The differences in opinion are cause for concern when the overwhelming preponderance of men in the economics profession is taken into account. Ms May and her co-authors found that men in their sample were twice as likely to be full professors as women. If economists 9 senior ranks are skewed in favour of men, then the profession 9s output might also be biased towards results they find appealing. A final difference that Ms May and her co-authors uncover suggests one reason why economists might dismiss gender differences as a problem. Male economists are relatively likely to think that men and women face equal job opportunities generally, and that pay gaps are largely explained by differences in skills and choice. By contrast, women are more likely to perceive unequal opportunities, both in general and specifically within academia. If women hold different views to men, then that could put them at odds with the profession 9s more senior gatekeepers. And if men are more likely to have faith in markets to nudge women to the best jobs, then they could be more resistant to the idea that the gender imbalance is a problem that needs solving. Men were also more sceptical than women that greater gender balance in research teams would improve economic knowledge. Of course, some differences of opinion need not necessarily reflect well on women. It might be that they suffer from cmotivated reasoning d, believing that their lack of promotion is because of the system rather than their own shortcomings, or that economics would benefit from more people like them. Alternatively, their personal experiences could give them information that men do not have. It seems plausible that men are susceptible to motivated reasoning too. It is easier to attribute one 9s success to hard work than to unfair privilege. Even the most brilliant of economists can be blind to their own biases. In 1960 George Stigler, a late Nobel laureate and dogged empiricist, bemoaned the cdeleterious effects of economists 9 policy desires on their theory, but maintained that overall, as a positive science, economics was ethically and politically neutral. Yet some of his own views fell short of this ideal. Susan Brandwayn, one of his former students and now an independent economist, remembers Mr Stigler telling her class that the day the University of Chicago 9s economics faculty hired a woman was the day that he would leave.  _ **Correction (February 25th 2018):** An earlier version of this piece referred to Susan Brandwayn as one of George Stigler 9s graduate students and suggested he had made his comment about the hiring of women to her. In fact he was speaking to her class in graduate school._ This article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Battle of the X 9s\"  ",

England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed \\xa370m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities.    It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North.   * Is there a north-south divide in schools?(/news/education-38172816)   * Osborne urges action on north-south divide(/news/business-42893861)  The commissioner's research also finds:   * too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up   * more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good   * large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18   * there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities  Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. * * *  Teenagers' concerns Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. \"There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,\" said Hafsah. \"Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south.  !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p062dkf7.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionHow Northern students see North-South education gap \"It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. \"It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. \"For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out. But it's not fair.\" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. \"A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. \"So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you.\" Qasim added: \"If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education.  Image caption Qasim says money plays a big part in opportunity  \"If you have more money, it does lead to more doors being opened for you. \"Some of us may have part-time jobs, but if your parents have a lot more money than other parents would do, then you won't have to get a part-time job so you can focus more on education, rather having a part-time job and having to pay for stuff.\" * * * Ms Longfield said that disadvantage manifested itself in childhood in many ways, including \"a lack of confidence, uncertainty and low expectation, isolated communities with narrow and poor job prospects, poor school results and poor connections to further and higher education\". She added: \"Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. \"There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. \"Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives.\"  Image copyrightOffice of the Children's CommissionerImage caption The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England  Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. \"The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do.\" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. \"We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. \"So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. \"Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. \"The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools.\"  'More to do' The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as \"Opportunity Areas\" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: \"We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. \"As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. \"Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes \\xa33.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, \\xa312m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home.\" The government has also committed \\xa370m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. \"By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England\"   ",

            "article": "  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deployed a new weapon at the Olympics to fight back against the Trump administration 9s sanctions and threats of a preemptive strike against his nuclear program: His sister. Kim Yo Jong shook hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, cheered enthusiastically for a unified Korean team, and displayed a sense of humor in weekend meetings. She also delivered a letter inviting(https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-10/kim-jong-un- invites-south-korea-s-moon-to-summit-in-pyongyang \"Kim Summit Invitation to South Korea May Ease Peninsula Tensions\") Moon to a summit with her brother in Pyongyang, and asked him to play a cleading role in reuniting the two Koreas after nearly seven decades.  cI never expected to come here on such short notice to be honest, and I thought it would be strange and different but it 9s not, Kim Yo Jong said at a dinner Sunday night before heading home. cThere are many things similar and the same. I hope we can quickly become one and meet these good people again in Pyongyang.     The warm words were aimed at further exploiting divisions between the U.S. and South Korea, which differ on the best way to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. Her visit amounted to a charm offensive designed to counter the U.S. narrative that Kim Jong Un is a madman who tortures his own people and would blow up Los Angeles or New York City if he didn 9t get his way. North Korea 9s participation in the Olympics has already allowed Kim Jong Un to undermine President Donald Trump 9s pressure campaign, with some sanctions suspended temporarily until the event ends. In pushing for a summit with Moon, Kim is seeking to consolidate those gains while maintaining his nuclear arsenal to deter a U.S. invasion. The question now is whether the U.S. and South Korea can stay united in keeping up the pressure on North Korea just as sanctions limiting export revenue and curbing fuel imports start to bite. While Trump 9s advisers have threatened military action to prevent Kim from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon, Moon is seeking to prevent a war that could devastate South Korea and the region. Kim 9s proposal for a summit was ca brilliant diplomatic maneuver, said Andrei Lankov, a historian at Kookmin University in Seoul who once studied in Pyongyang. Moon would irritate Trump if he accepts the invitation, while declining would make the U.S. and South Korea appear cunreasonably bellicose, he said. How North Korea Managed to Crash the Olympics Party(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/the-koreas-get-in- the-olympic-spirit-for-now \"Click for full story\")      cThe proposal, as well as North Korea 9s presence at the Games, sends a signal that the North Koreans are ready to talk, Lankov said. cAnd this signal helps the opponents of a military operation in Washington and elsewhere. Signs of discord in the U.S.-South Korea alliance were evident immediately after the announcement. Moon 9s office initially provided conflicting accounts of whether he accepted the invitation, with a Blue House spokesperson later clarifying that pre-conditions first needed to be met. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence didn 9t discuss the invitation with Moon Saturday while they watched a speed-skating event, a senior White House official said. Speaking to reporters later, Pence reiterated that there was cno daylight between the U.S., South Korea and Japan in pushing to isolate North Korea until Kim abandons his nuclear program.  Pence Talks Later on, Pence told the Washington Post that the U.S. is ready to engage in talks about North Korea 9s nuclear program even as it maintains pressure on Kim 9s regime. In the interview, he said Moon assured him that the North Koreans wouldn 9t get economic or diplomatic benefits for just talking 4 only for taking concrete steps toward denuclearization. Moon came to power promising a softer approach to Pyongyang and has repeatedly sought a summit with Kim Jong Un. Moon initially opposed U.S. plans to deploy a missile shield in South Korea, and last year vowed to prevent war at all costs after Trump threatened cfire and fury against North Korea. Moon faces the risk of a backlash at home if he goes too far. His approval ratings, while still high at 63 percent, fell after he pushed for a unified women 9s ice hockey team for the two Koreas. Conservative groups have protested the appearance of North Korean athletes at the Games in Pyeongchang with vulgar signs.  8Wild Dream 9 South Korea 9s Unification Ministry said Monday that the dialogue would be led by the two Koreas with cooperation and support from international partners. South Korea cwill faithfully implement the international sanctions on North Korea, while also adhering to the principle of resolution through peaceful means, it said. North Korea has shown no signs it 9s willing to discuss denuclearization. Its negotiators protested last month when South Koreans raised the issue during talks over the Olympics, a line North Korea 9s state-run media has reiterated. Last week, a commentary published by the Korean Central News Agency called denuclearization ca wild dream that can never come true. Moon won 9t have much space to negotiate with North Korea without backing from the U.S.,\\xa0said Christopher Green, senior adviser on the Korean peninsula at the International Crisis Group in Amsterdam.  cHis goal is to do enough on the inter-Korean front to get the United States and North Korea to jaw-jaw, Green said. cThe real strategic games have only just begun.  _ 4 With assistance by Sohee Kim, and Toluse Olorunnipa_   ",

            "article": " But for the latter movement, stories of officer-involved shootings were dismissed at first as gratuitous race-baiting, then as exceptional cautionary tales, then as isolated incidents, then as pleas not to allow one bad apple to spoil the bunch. The court of public opinion was slow to grant validity, eventually yielding only to numbers tabulated in headstones. But in the post-MeToo era, it seems the tide has changed. Anecdotes are sufficient; formal due process is perhaps optional. Deaf ears are now empathetic, and unwilling to entertain the notion that misconduct could ever be \"justifiable.\" What matters is listening to ensure that no one else will find their loved one's name next to a hashtag. Find it ironic? Me too. !Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180110130620-02-catherine-deneuve- file-large-169.jpg)(/2018/01/10/opinions/le-monde-letter-catherine-deneuve- perez-opinion/index.html) Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(/2018/01/10/opinions/le-monde-letter-catherine-deneuve-perez- opinion/index.html) But Justice Ginsburg's revelation was hardly intended to identify a powerful irony. It was intended to acknowledge the powerful force of momentum. The Supreme Court hears but a lean fraction of cases seeking its review. Among the factors (https://www.supremecourt.gov/filingandrules/2017RulesoftheCourt.pdf)it considers is the divisiveness of the issue presented, the impact of the court's holding on the nation, and whether the conduct at issue offends our collective constitutional principles. But as landmark civil rights cases like Brown v. Board of Education or Lawrence v. Texas demonstrate, momentum has a way of catapulting an issue to the front of the figurative queue. But sometimes momentum yields unfortunate results. Before invalidating a key provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get pre-authorization from the Department of Justice before making any changes to its voting laws, for instance, Chief Justice John Roberts implied(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/holder-v-roberts) the election of black men and women to political office placed us in a post-racial world that no longer required this kind of government oversight. Ginsburg correctly dissented, arguing instead that such protections were necessary in spite of perceptions of progress. She, like others who have experienced discrimination, understood that pruning the tree of oppression doesn't destroy its roots. Milestones, no matter how significant, should neither be blindly touted nor used as an excuse to call off the watchdogs. It should shock and offend you that a nation this old should still be patted on the back for taking its first steps. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the MeToo movement seems to prompt such visceral reactions. People believed that we were in a post-gender world. We're not. People are surprised to learn that democratic principles of equality remain aspirational, and elude huge segments of our population. Even 45 years after the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade, the right of women to exercise autonomy over their bodies remains vulnerable to political attack. The litmus test for whether you believe in equality is not whether one wears a pin; it is whether you understand that equality is the linchpin of a democratic society. Are you surprised that people still don't understand that? Me too.  ",

If successful, this regressive law (https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hr-620-could-put-disability-rights-at- risk)would significantly hinder a person with a disability's right to file a lawsuit for violations of access. It would require creating a written claim with specific legal requirements to document the violation (which would be onerous for an attorney, let alone your average John Q. Public with little experience with accessibility requirements and measurements). Businesses would then have 60 days to respond and an additional 120 days make \"substantial progress(https://www.defendingourfuture.org/hr-620-ada-education-and-reform- act/)\" -- a term still undefined. In practice, business owners could spend decades failing to comply with the accessibility requirements of the ADA as long as they claim to be attempting substantial progress. This attempt to undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities is happening largely in response to several stories claiming that there is a growing army of disabled people cruising the streets, looking for potential lawsuits wherever they go, and are getting rich off of the spoils. The reality, of course, is that the only thing that can be collected in ADA lawsuits are attorney's fees, so no disabled person who brings charges can actually get monetary damages from a lawsuit. All they can achieve is the business remedying its inaccessibility. !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley-family-1-large-169.jpg) !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley- family-1-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family 04:42 Furthermore, in cases where it's assumed that there are hundreds of lawyers repeatedly filing case after case to the point of appearing fraudulent, the Center for American Progress (where I am a senior fellow) has traced the number of attorneys doing so to only 12 lawyers, and there are disciplinary actions available to take action against them in state bar associations or district courts. A federal law -- especially one that would harm more than help -- is hardly necessary here. There is a significant countermovement against this legislation, comprised of a mix of social media (with groups like Crip the Vote and others using HandsOffMyADA), traditional civil disobedience by ADAPT(http://adapt.org/) and others, visits to legislators and phone banking by older disability organizations like the ARC and the Autism Society. These organizations are also working with groups like Little Lobbyists (https://www.littlelobbyists.org/)and other parent/family organizations who organized last year to protect Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. For those of us who are parents and working in the disability justice space, these alliances are proving to be interesting examples of not having to choose one group or the other. As someone who was 10 years old when the ADA became law, I have little memory of life before it, beyond what I've heard from my parents and elders in the community. The notion that I will need to start thinking about life without the ADA or with extremely limited access, paired with additional bureaucratic measures required to access public spaces, feels like I forgot to turn off Netflix before bed and an especially dark episode of \"Black Mirror\" is still playing in the background. This shouldn't be our reality.

He was a global chief administrative officer and partner of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and, he said, cI wanted to fundamentally shift my career. , When Mr. Fisher turned 50, he heard about the program and started to make his plan. cI was nervous about finding my new career, he said. cI 9m the type of guy who wants to go get things done. I felt it would be valuable for me to be in a stimulating environment, where I had to develop different routines and to detox, or reprogram. , This semester, Mr. Fisher is enrolled in a course on community colleges and another on leaders and leadership in history at the Harvard Kennedy School. His aim is to figure out his cnext direction, to have a little bit of fun, make some new friends and to broaden my perspective and life, he said. cI did not retire in the classic sense of the word.

'Brainwashing' process Kanat and other human rights advocates describe, citing sources on the ground, how people supposedly prone to influences of Islamic extremism undergo a \"brainwashing\" process inside the detention camps -- often housed in converted schools or government buildings. Detainees are required to praise the ruling Communist Party, sing revolutionary songs, learn to speak Mandarin, study the thought of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and confess perceived transgressions such as praying at a mosque or traveling abroad, according to activists. \"It's completely unlawful -- the authorities provide no legal documentation to the families and there are no time limits (on the length of detention),\" said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, which published a detailed report on the subject last September and called on Beijing to free all detainees. !Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180201130146-xinjiang-anti-terror- propaganda-posters-large-169.jpg) Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014. \"There's a lot of fear, with people losing contact with loved ones.\" Xinjiang authorities have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for information on the political education camps and response to activists' allegations, but state media outlets have covered these facilities and touted their effectiveness in de-radicalizing the locals. One newspaper article last April said that Uyghur residents \"eat and live alongside party cadres\" in one such camp that had \"already trained 2,008 people.\"(http://www.xinjiangyaou.com/xinjiang/002/1455513.shtml) Calling for a \"great wall of iron\" to safeguard the region's stability, President Xi has further expanded and strengthened China's vast security forces in Xinjiang.  Ubiquitous surveillance Activists say the regional government, now led by a hardline Xi loyalist, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs but also increasingly relied on high-tech tools to keep the population in check. They cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65. The authorities also enacted a sweeping anti-extremism law last year, with long beards, veils in public and home-schooling all on the ban list,(https://cnn.com/2017/03/31/asia/china-xinjiang-new-rules/index.html) prompting new denunciations from international human rights groups. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment as well as curtailed religious freedom in their homeland. Other critics have linked the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's repressive reign there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. !A Chinese paramilitary policeman watches as an ethnic Uyghur family walks in front of Urumqi&39;s Grand Bazaar, July, 2009.

Over the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, has also fueled ethnic tensions, despite the government's best effort to paint a picture of ethnic harmony. \"We guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnicities and prohibit the discrimination and oppression against any ethnic groups,\" Zhang Yijiong, a senior Communist Party official in charge ethnic minority affairs, told reporters last October. \"The cultures, histories, languages and traditions of all ethnicities are protected and respected by national laws.\" Critics of Beijing's Uyghur policy see a starkly different scenario in Xinjiang, as the authorities intensify their crackdown and forced political indoctrination spreads. \"These campaigns are purportedly about counter-extremism and counterterrorism, but ... it's really about surveillance, control and assimilation,\" said Wang, the Human Rights Watch researcher. \"The real intention of the Chinese government is to eliminate the Uyghurs as a distinct ethnic group,\" Rebiya Kadeer, a longtime exiled Uyghur leader who recently stepped down as president of the World Uyghur Congress, told CNN in an interview in Washington last year. \"Religious suppression, cultural restrictions, Uyghur language ban -- all this repression in Xinjiang only makes the Uyghurs hold on to their identity more firmly,\" she added. \"China has awakened the Uyghur people.\"  ",

            "article": " New York 9s 1.1 million students have this week off, giving Richard A. Carranza(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/nyregion/carranza-new-york- schools-chancellor.html), as of Monday the chancellor of the city 9s public schools, a chance to ease into running the country 9s largest school system. , With 75,000 teachers and 1,800 schools, the job is a big leap for anyone. Mr. Carranza faces an additional set of challenges. He is new to New York and has never worked in the system, unlike his predecessor, Carmen Fari\\xf1a, who spent 52 years in the city 9s schools. His new boss, Bill de Blasio, is a second-term mayor with likely ambitions for higher office and a reputation as a micromanager. , At the news conference where his appointment was announced, Mr. Carranza declared that there was cno daylight between himself and the mayor, which makes it hard to know how much he will set a new course for the school system or push on issues, like segregation, that the administration has soft- pedaled. , Mr. Carranza comes to New York by way of Houston where he had a short stint as superintendent. Before that, he worked in San Francisco, Clark County, Nev., and Tucson, where he grew up. As he steps into his new position, here are some of the biggest issues he will face. , A 2014 report (https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration- and-diversity/ny-norflet-report-placeholder \"The report\")found that New York City has one of the most segregated school systems in the country. Nearly 70 percent of students are black and Latino, and they overwhelmingly go to school in racially isolated classrooms, with few white and Asian children. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Fari\\xf1a have repeatedly blamed the city 9s segregated neighborhoods and have suggested there is little they can do. Even after facing intense public pressure, they have taken only modest steps, such as setting aside seats in some schools for low-income students. When the mayor released what had been billed as a cbigger vision d(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/nyregion/mayor-bill-de- blasio-new-york-public-schools-diversity-plan.html \"Times coverage\") for integrating schools, he resisted even using the word csegregated. , A high-profile example of the problem is the lack of black and Latino students at the eight specialized high schools where admission is decided by a single test. This spring, only 10 percent of offers(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/nyregion/admissions-specialized- high-schools-new-york.html) at these schools went to black and Latino students. When Mr. de Blasio was running for mayor in 2013, he pledged to diversify these schools, but more recently he has suggested(https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/newsletters/politico-new- york-education/2018/03/12/de-blasio-on-specialized-high-school-diversity- crisis-043202) that his hands are tied and that any change must come from the state. , Mr. de Blasio came into office pledging to lift up low-performing schools, rather than close them, as his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had done. But his $582 million Renewal initiative, which flooded 94 schools with resources while subjecting them to sometimes contradictory directives, has produced disappointing results(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/nyregion /new-york-city-will-close-or-merge-19-schools-most-from-renewal-program.html). This year, the city proposed closing eight of the schools 4 the largest number it had ever closed in one year 4 drawing protests from parents and elected officials. , Mr. Carranza will have to decide whether to continue the initiative, whose future looks cloudy; the official who led the effort was recently moved aside, and no successor has been named. Fifty schools are expected to remain in the program next year. Another challenge: The city 9s Education Department has said that, to replace some of the schools it is closing, it will open eight new schools in the fall, something that this administration has little experience doing. , Though the city has made real progress on increasing overall graduation rates, the academic divides between different groups of students are yawning. Citywide, the graduation rate last year was 87.5 percent for Asian students and 83.2 percent for white students. For black students, the rate was 70 percent and for Hispanic students, 68.3 percent. Just 32.5 percent of students still learning English graduated. , Even within the same school, black and Hispanic students and those who live in poverty can fall behind their peers. A study(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/nyregion/study-black-white- achievement-gap-schools.html) from the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School looked at student performance for third through fifth graders on the 2016 state math exam, and it found the poorer the students, the lower their scores tended to be on the test, even if they attended school with wealthy children. , The issue is far from unique to New York. In San Francisco, Mr. Carranza faced a similar gap: African-American children there have long scored among the lowest in California on standardized tests. cIt 9s fair to say that like all the superintendents before him he was not able to find the magic formula, said Norman Yee, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco and a former president of the city 9s Board of Education. , In San Francisco, where Mr. Carranza spent his longest-tenure as a superintendent, he oversaw about 55,000 children. In New York, double that number 4 more than 111,500 students 4 were homeless at some point during the 2016-17 school year. That is 10 percent of the city 9s public school population. , Those homeless students include anyone in a temporary living situation, which could include children living in a car or a hotel or staying on the sofa at a friend 9s house. , In addition to the emotional toll, the academic effects of homelessness can be severe. Homeless students are chronically absent at far higher rates than other children, are more likely to drop out than their peers and less likely to graduate or to test on grade level. Even after finding housing, the Education Trust-New York found that formerly homeless children continue to struggle academically(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/homeless- students-school-new-york.html) for years. , Following through on a campaign promise, Mr. de Blasio in his first term created a public prekindergarten seat for every 4-year-old in the city. He is now planning to go further, creating thousands of seats for 3-year-olds in what he is calling c3-K. But while the prekindergarten initiative has been popular among parents, it has caused problems(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/nyregion/free-preschool-deblasio- new-york-city.html) for the previously existing system that provides free or subsidized child care and early education to low-income families. , Home-based child care providers have lost income and stand to lose more as 3-K is rolled out. So-called EarlyLearn centers, which serve infants to 5-year- olds 4 and, unlike prekindergarten classes in public schools, are open 10 hours a day and do not close for school vacations 4 are struggling to retain teachers, because teachers in public schools can make as much as $30,000 more per year. Many centers have had to close classrooms because they cannot find teachers to oversee them. , Directors of these programs have begged the city to address the salary disparity, which they say has drawn experienced teachers away from classrooms serving low-income children 4 who need those teachers the most 4 to classrooms serving higher-income children. ,  cThe narrative out of City Hall is that the signature initiative is early childhood education, and how that has helped low-income families, said David Nocenti, the executive director of Union Settlement, which serves roughly 350 children in centers in East Harlem. cThe reality is quite different. , About 200,000 New York City public school children are identified as having a disability, which can range from mild learning differences to severe challenges. , Spending on special education has increased under the de Blasio administration, while results for these students remain poor. The graduation rate among students with disabilities last year was just 46.7 percent, and the enormous system that serves them is riddled with problems. According to an annual report that the Education Department makes to the City Council, 48,000(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/nyregion/special-education-nyc- schools.html) students during the last school year received only some of the services they needed, or none at all. , Highlighting an additional area of vast shortcomings, the city 9s public advocate, Letitia James, found(https://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/sites/advocate.nyc.gov/files/denial_of_service_report_7717_1.pdf) that in the 2015-16 school year nearly half of the 9,000 issued vouchers, which allow students to receive services their schools cannot provide, went unused, in part because there were too few therapists in certain parts of the city. The Special Education Student Information System, the electronic platform that tracks student needs and services, is also riddled(https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/05/09/new-york-citys- special-ed-tracking-system-malfunctioned-more-than-800000-times-per-day-but- changes-are-underway/) with problems that, for example, lead it to provide incomplete information about whether students are receiving the services they need. , Mr. de Blasio ran for office criticizing charter schools and promising to halt the practice of giving them space in public school buildings, but he soon got a lesson(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/nyregion/cuomo-put-his-weight- behind-charter-school-protections.html) in the danger of going head-to-head with their wealthy supporters. In 2014, the year that Mr. de Blasio took office, a pro-charter group spent $9.6 million on lobbying(https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/nyregion/groups-that-back- bloombergs-education-agenda-enjoy-success-in-albany.html), more than any other organization in the state, much of it on advertisements attacking him. , Since then his administration has at times struggled to navigate its relationship with the city 9s 227 charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated and serve roughly 10 percent of the city 9s public school students. Perhaps the biggest challenge in the coming years will be finding space for new or expanding charter schools. Under legislation passed in 2014, the city must provide space for these schools or be responsible for at least part of their rent. But nearly every decision to place a charter school inside a school building is controversial, requiring other schools to squeeze into less space. , Ms. Fari\\xf1a has at times been disparaging of charters, and charter leaders are hoping that Mr. Carranza 9s arrival will be an opportunity for a reset. James Merriman, the chief executive officer of the New York City Charter School Center, said he hoped Mr. Carranza would embrace charter schools as partners. He suggested that Mr. Carranza could ask charter leaders to start schools specifically aimed at serving homeless students, for instance, or, with a change in state law, ask a high-performing charter to take over an elementary school zone and enroll all students in the zone rather than admit students through a lottery. ,  cIf he 9s willing to meet the sector at that level and see us as full partners, he 9ll find people on the other side, and together with philanthropy, we could do some interesting things, Mr. Merriman said.

Some commercial software can now tell the gender of a person in a photograph. , When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time. , But the darker the skin, the more errors arise 4 up to nearly 35 percent for images of darker skinned women, according to a new study that breaks fresh ground by measuring how the technology works on people of different races and gender. , These disparate results, calculated by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, show how some of the biases in the real world can seep into artificial intelligence, the computer systems that inform facial recognition. , In modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women. , One widely used facial-recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white, according to another research study. , The new study also raises broader questions of fairness and accountability in artificial intelligence at a time when investment in and adoption of the technology is racing ahead. , Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending. , Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults(https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement 4 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases. , Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far. ,  cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail 4 to make them socially accountable, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah. , Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, Google had to apologize(https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/google- photos-mistakenly-labels-black-people-gorillas/) after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as cgorillas. , Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini 9s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations. ,  cBut this is the first work I 9m aware of that shows that empirically, Ms. Friedler said. , Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long. , But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face. , By then, face recognition software was increasingly moving out of the lab and into the mainstream. ,  cO.K., this is serious, she recalled deciding then. cTime to do something. , So she turned her attention to fighting the bias built into digital technology. Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of calgorithmic accountability, which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair. , Her short TED Talk(https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms) on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the Algorithmic Justice League(https://www.ajlunited.org/), a project to raise awareness of the issue. , In her newly published paper(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf), which will be presented at a conference(https://fatconference.org/) this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems 4 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China 4 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software 4 and their code was publicly available for testing. , She found them all wanting. , To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark- skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents. , The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race. , Then, each company 9s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft 9s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM 9s and Megvii 9s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males. , Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was cdeeply committed to cunbiased and ctransparent services. This month, the company said, it will roll out an improved service with a nearly 10-fold increase in accuracy on darker-skinned women. , Microsoft said that it had calready taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology and that it was investing in research cto recognize, understand and remove bias. , Ms. Buolamwini 9s co-author on her paper is Timnit Gebru, who described her role as an adviser. Ms. Gebru is a scientist at Microsoft Research, working on its Fairness Accountability Transparency and Ethics in A.I. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/fate/)group. , Megvii, whose Face++ software is widely used for identification in online payment and ride-sharing services in China, did not reply to several requests for comment, Ms. Buolamwini said. , Ms. Buolamwini is releasing her data set for others to build upon. She describes her research as ca starting point, very much a first step toward solutions. , Ms. Buolamwini is taking further steps in the technical community and beyond. She is working with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(https://www.ieee.org/index.html), a large professional organization in computing, to set up a group to create standards for accountability and transparency in facial analysis software. , She meets regularly with other academics, public policy groups and philanthropies that are concerned about the impact of artificial intelligence. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation(https://www.fordfoundation.org/), said that the new technology could be a cplatform for opportunity, but that it would not happen if it replicated and amplified bias and discrimination of the past. ,  cThere is a battle going on for fairness, inclusion and justice in the digital world, Mr. Walker said. , Part of the challenge, scientists say, is that there is so little diversity within the A.I. community.  ,  cWe 9d have a lot more introspection and accountability in the field of A.I. if we had more people like Joy, said Cathy O 9Neil, a data scientist and author of cWeapons of Math Destruction. , Technology, Ms. Buolamwini said, should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it 9s used on. ,  cYou can 9t have ethical A.I. that 9s not inclusive, she said. cAnd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards.

She and her husband threw water and supplies into a tiny closet under the stairs and huddled with their infant and 2-year-old, believing they were about to die.\\xa0 \"We grabbed everything we possibly could -- blankets, pillows, diapers, wipes, food, water bottles -- as I'm crying my eyes out,\" Thompson said. \"We called his parents, and I'm crying so hard that they can't understand me.\" It took 38 minutes for officials to send an alert retracting the warning because Hawaii did not have a standardized system for sending such corrections, the FCC said.\\xa0    The federal agency, which regulates the nation's airwaves and sets standards for such emergency alerts, criticized the state's delay in correcting it.\\xa0 The head of the FCC has called the error \"absolutely unacceptable(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-false-ballistic-missile- alert-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-investigation/).\" Earlier this month,\\xa0Miyagi gave CBS News correspondent David Begnaud a tour(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-hawaiis-emergency-alert-command- center/) of Hawaii's Emergency Alert Command Center and discussed what went wrong. During their conversation, Miyagi explained cellphone users weren't told about the error sooner because his agency didn't have procedures for issuing corrections. That has since changed 4 and two people will now be required to send out alerts in the future.\\xa0 The FCC said the state Emergency Management Agency has already taken steps to try to avoid a repeat of the false alert, requiring more supervision of drills and alert and test-alert transmissions. It has created a correction template for false alerts and has stopped ballistic missile defense drills until its own investigation is done. According to the FCC inquiry, the recorded message used for the drill began by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" -- the script for a drill, the FCC said. Then the recording used language that is typically used for a real threat, not a drill: \"this is not a drill.\" The recording ended by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise.\" However, the worker on duty did not hear the \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" part of the message and believed the threat was real, according to the employee's statement. The worker responded by sending the alert.   ",

To build a website I needed a computer, but no one in my family could afford one. Luckily, my relative gave me a Nokia 2690 phone. It wasn't very advanced, but adequate enough for me to learn the language of programming.  The new Zuckerberg? !Nokia 2690 phone.(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Nokia 2690 phone.(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180104171441-nokia-2690 -phone-large-169.jpg) Nokia 2690 phone. Once I had become a capable programmer, the idea for my first web project was sparked after I watched The Social Network movie, which about the founding of Facebook. I was inspired by Mark Zuckerberg. But I wanted to go further and create something better. At that time Facebook was set up to connect people you already knew, but I wanted to create a platform which connected everybody. After some time and a lot of effort, my attempt to replace Facebook fell through. I couldn't get enough users to sign up on the website. The few that signed up didn't stick around because there was only a few people to chat with.  A new idea, a new app !The dot Learn team.

I quickly moved onto my next idea: an app that makes it easy to send text messages to multiple people at once and at an affordable price. The cost of sending text messages in Nigeria was around $0.013, I planned on reducing it to $0.005. To build the app, I learned a new programming language called Java. I also needed to have a computer to compile the code, but I still couldn't afford one. Fortunately, I was able to find a way to build an app right on my Nokia phone, through an application called J2ME SDK Mobile(http://elvischidera.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/create-j2me-apps-with-your- mobile-phone.html). I spent days programming, carefully typing everything on the phone's small number pad. After a few months, I had built the website and the app. !Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171207115153-kenya-cyrptocurrency- miner-restricted-large-169.jpg)(/2017/12/18/africa/inside-life- cryptocurrency-miner-kenya-africa/index.html) Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner(/2017/12/18/africa/inside- life-cryptocurrency-miner-kenya-africa/index.html) The app launch went well\\u200a -- \\u200aat least better than my first project. We got some local press and grew to about 5,000 users. There were a few daily transactions, but over time, due in part to my inexperience (I was still only 14 years old), I was not able to keep up with the number of users and had to shut the app down. It was becoming clear that to take my programming skills to the next level I would need a computer. I cut my daily expenses and lived a simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop. Still, it wasn't enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job building a website to earn the remaining sum. How do you build a website for PC on a feature phone? Simple: have a Facebook friend you disturb every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback. It was cheaper than going to a cyber cafe.  Making apps !Welcome, to the bleeding-edge of African innovation: VR, 3D printing, AI and the rest.

            "article": " AUTOMATION and globalisation have brought drastic changes to Western labour markets. Middle-skilled jobs are disappearing fast. In America, wages for blue-collar workers have been largely stagnant since the 1970s, whereas those for university graduates have soared. Silicon Valley types frequently warn that advances in technology, especially in artificial intelligence, will be devastating for low-skilled workers. One prominent study, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University, estimated that 47% of jobs in America could be automated over the next two decades. The spectre of mass unemployment, along with increasing levels of income equality, has led many policymakers to see investment in university as crucial for economic prosperity. Governments have plenty of reason to be bullish about higher education. Perhaps the best piece of evidence they have of the wisdom of investing more in universities is the graduate-wage premium 4the difference in wages between those with university degrees and those without. In their book cThe Race between Education and Technology d, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz of Harvard University point out that this premium fell during the first half of the 20th century in America as universities expanded enrolment, but started rising sharply around 1980. Although the premium has started to level off in recent years, the fact that university graduates still make around 70% more than non-graduates suggests that demand for skilled workers still far exceeds supply.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

While universities are places of learning, they are also social sorting mechanisms. Part of the reason why university graduates earn more is because they are brighter and harder-working to begin with. Some professionals, such as doctors or engineers, do require an extensive amount of technical training, but many do not. The fact that humanities graduates, whose courses often have little to do with their subsequent work, tend to earn more if they come from more prestigious institutions suggests that one reason for going to university is to get ahead of peers in the job market. Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, argues that earning a degree is like cstanding up at a concert d. Doing so improves your view of the show, but it comes at a cost to those sitting behind you. Across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, 43% of adults aged 25-34 now have tertiary degrees, up from 23% in 1995. Yet it is not clear to what extent these degrees have translated into economic gains. An analysis by _The Economist_ of American labour-market data finds that since 1970 the share of workers with degrees has increased in virtually every occupation. But in around half of occupations with better-educated workers average wages have still fallen in real terms. The ubiquity of the degree means that for many workers going to university is more of an obligation than a choice. Moreover, university does not suit all learners. Estimates of the economic returns to higher education tend to assume that all students will graduate. In practice, around 30% of students in Europe and 40% of students in America will drop out before earning their degrees. This means that the expected economic returns of a university education for average students are far lower than commonly understood. Governments are right to fret about training future workers, but they should look beyond just universities.  ",

Still others, like 83-year-old Geraldine Wallace, wrote in saying that she told her granddaughter that cI 9m glad your generation isn 9t putting up with this. , This week, after an anonymous allegation against Aziz Ansari was made public in an online magazine called Babe(https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz- ansari-28355), those conversations seemed to take on a different tone. Women of all ages debated what the article, which recounted a date between a 23 -year-old woman known as cGrace and the actor in 2017, actually depicted. Was it, in Grace 9s words, a case of sexual assault 4 or was it merely a really bad date?

( cApparently there is a whole country full of young women who don 9t know how to call a cab, she wrote.) , Meanwhile, a 33-year-old staff editor and writer, Bari Weiss, wrote in The Times Opinion(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe- sexual-harassment.html?_r=0) section that Mr. Ansari was guilty of only one thing: Not being a mind reader. , In Vox(https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace- babe-me-too), Jezebel(https://jezebel.com/babe-what-are-you- doing-1822114753) and The Guardian(https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/16/aziz-ansari- story-missed-opportunity), women in their 20s and 30s noted that while they considered the Babe piece to be poorly reported, it had sparked an important and necessary conversation about the complicated dynamics of sexual consent. , We gathered Ms. Weiss and two other Times staffers 4 ages 29 and 59 4 to talk sexual consent, metoo and the seeming generational divide. , **JESSICA BENNETT: This particular story has left me grappling with a particular question. Is it possible for something to be nonconsensual but** **also** **not sexual assault?** , **BARI WEISS, STAFF EDITOR AND WRITER, OPINION, 33** : One of the most remarkable aspects of this truly remarkable moment is that we are collectively and openly reassessing what we regard as kosher when sex and power is involved. But one of the more distressing and underreported aspects of this re-moralization is that some younger feminists are telling older feminists that they don 9t understand their own lives. They are telling women who experienced what they considered cbad dates or cbad sex that those experiences were, in fact, assault. Or worse. , Many older feminists I know are sitting there saying cHow dare you look at me 4 me who has kicked open the door of every room you occupy, who had to beg for the paid maternity leave you now enjoy, who endured the alienation of being the only woman at the table so that now you get to sit at its head 4 and tell me I 9m not self-aware enough to understand my own life? , **FAHIMA HAQUE, SOCIAL STRATEGY EDITOR, 29** : I probably sound salty but it doesn 9t surprise me that women, generationally, are differing on the MeToo movement. I am a younger feminist, but I 9m not an unthinking one who assumes I have no agency. I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I 9ve grappled with, nearly every day of my life, what needs to happen for men to be better and for women to feel strong enough to use their voice clearly to hold men accountable. So I fully admit that I 9m pretty militant about male behavior. , **SUSAN CHIRA, SENIOR GENDER CORRESPONDENT, 59** : I share my generation 9s general unease with labeling sexual awkwardness sexual assault. It 9s not only about refusing to see yourself as a victim, but also it 9s a fundamental act of fairness. I also think all generations are confronting that sex is an area of great uncertainty, vulnerability and, at times, abuse of power. Just because it 9s common to emerge from bad sexual encounters feeling bruised doesn 9t mean we shouldn 9t question why it 9s so common and what needs to change. , **There seems to be one thing some younger women have insisted on: That Aziz did abuse his power in the situation, even if it wasn 9t professional power. What do you think?** , **BW:** Refusing to give a factory worker a promotion unless she blows you? That is an abuse of power. Going on a date and hooking up 4 however boorishly 4 with another person? That is simply not an abuse of power. If we are going to weigh every relationship on the scales of power, well, then investment bankers won 9t be allowed to date baristas. We need to draw a bright line between what happens in the workplace and what happens in the privacy of our apartments (or kitchens). Right now they are getting conflated. , **SC:** I think it 9s crucial to make distinctions, and Aziz 9s accuser fell far short because she didn 9t. Yes, he was more powerful than she was 4 not only as a man who often takes the role of aggressor in sex, but also because of his celebrity. But he held no institutional power over her career or advancement. And yet if he behaved boorishly or insensitively, if he failed to pick up cues she may have been too embarrassed to verbalize, he, like other men who 9ve behaved this way, should be reflecting on why this encounter went so awry. , **Bari, you wrote this week that the only thing Aziz is guilty of is not being a mind reader. That 9s true, but Grace also describes expressing her discomfort in multiple places. Shouldn 9t we have a higher bar for men 9s emotional intelligence?** , **BW:** Absolutely. But that is not going to happen overnight. And until that blessed day of universal male emotional intelligence is upon us 4 or when someone figures out how to clone Jeff Goldblum 4 I want fewer women to be harassed, assaulted and raped. In part that means telling women to use their common sense. , **FH:** Aziz Ansari did write a (very good) book on modern romance, but this just highlights that even the most sensitive, thoughtful 4 dare I say 8woke 9 4 kind of man also has a lot to learn. We need to have a higher bar. , **Daphne Merkin, a critic and novelist, recentlymade the point(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/opinion/golden-globes-metoo.html) in our Opinion section that we are treating women like frail Victorian-era housewives. I heard similar from a middle-aged friend, who wondered why Grace didn 9t cjust get up and leave. Thoughts?** , **FH:** The cget up and leave theory is, in theory, a good one. But that just feels ugly and callous in practice. It paints some women as strong warriors and others as weak fools. I will always respect first- and second- wave feminists for taking those crucial first steps for women 9s rights, but to shun the new wave of women because their approach is different is divisive. We won 9t move forward. I get that Grace 9s actions are grating, because ideally she would have felt confident enough in herself to leave. But I remember that at 23 it can be daunting to be the one who says no. , **SC:** Not sure this cuts generationally, though it may. That is, there are so many reasons women may be constrained from saying explicitly when they 9re uncomfortable, or they end up staying what turns out in hindsight to have been too long. Yes, it 9s important to learn to say no firmly. But we all know men don 9t always listen to that. And we also know that women themselves are often conflicted. Sex is always going to be messy and fumbling, to some degree. And I personally think we have to be tolerant of some uncertainty, some grayness. But if MeToo is going to spur real changes, men have to curb their sense of entitlement. , **Here 9s a question we get often from readers: What about due process? Is it really fair to place Aziz Ansari 9s name on the same spectrum as Harvey Weinstein?** , **BW:** Our current situation 4 guilty because accused, as Margaret Atwood put it(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/am-i-a-bad- feminist/article37591823/) 4 is absolutely terrifying to me. And it should be to anyone that cares about justice and due process. , **FH:** The MeToo movement is the best part of social media. And trial by Twitter is the worst part of social media. But, most people aren 9t on Twitter exhaustively the way media folks are, so frankly while it 9s troubling that some bring out their 280-count pitchforks, I 9m just not too concerned that it 9s going to sideline the overall power and scope of such newfound, increased transparency. , **SC:** What 9s extraordinary 4 and deeply unsettling 4 is that MeToo gives women power that men have had for so long. Men could ruin reputations, undermine or destroy women 9s careers, act impulsively. I hope and believe that women can wield power more responsibly and more justly. , _This interview has been edited and condensed._ , _**Make a friend 9s day: Forward this email.**_ , _Get this from a friend?Sign up here(https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters /gender-issues). _ , _You can also read uson the web(https://www.nytimes.com/series/metoo-moment) or listen to us on WNYC 9s The Takeaway(https://www.wnyc.org/series /metoo-memos-understanding-cultural-moment). _ , _Share your feedback atnytgender@nytimes.com(mailto:nytgender@nytimes.com)._  ",

Where do morals come from? What is the difference between Jesus in the Bible and in other scriptures? These are just some of the questions the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) says that secondary school pupils grapple with on a regular basis. But the REC is warning that a shortage of religious education teachers could contribute to religious stereotyping and discrimination, leaving pupils at risk of becoming ignorant, or bigoted. It says high quality specialist teaching about all faiths, beliefs and world views is essential in a diverse society and is launching a campaign to try to attract more teachers into the profession. Government data shows that in 2017-18, only 405 of initial teacher training places in England for RE were filled - well below the target of 643; figures for Wales have not yet been published.    The figures come against a backdrop of schools struggling to retain existing teachers(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42873153) \\- last month a report found the number of qualified teachers leaving the profession (for reasons other than retirement) had increased from 6% (25,260) of the qualified workforce in 2011 to 8% (34,910) in 2016.  'The big mysteries of life' For Lynsey Wilkinson, head of religious education at Redhill Academy in Arnold near Nottingham, RE is important, given the range of views and opinions to which pupils are exposed. \"We live in a dynamic ever-changing society full of different perspectives, beliefs and cultures,\" says Miss Wilkinson. \"Learning about these things helps the pupils in my classroom see the world clearly and helps them develop a genuine understanding about the world and the people in it. \"And that understanding will help them to shape the society of the future - a better society.\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Miss Wilkinson says that while she does not have a religious faith herself, it's exhilarating to debate big questions of life with pupils. \"I don't consider myself religious, but there's an academic side to RE that's fascinating to me - the idea of approaching these huge concepts from an intellectual point of view is one I've developed a real passion for. \"I spend my day helping these tirelessly curious kids get to grips with the big mysteries of life, examining spiritual beliefs, walking them through abstract philosophical concepts and getting into spirited debates over morals and ethics.\"  'At risk of ignorance' Rudolf Eliott Lockhart, chief executive of the REC, says specialist teachers are crucial for keeping young people properly informed. \"Without good quality religious education delivered by a qualified RE teacher, who provides accurate and balanced information about the array of different world views that make up modern Britain, young people are placed at risk. \"Not only are they at risk of ignorance that might lead to misunderstanding or even bigotry, but as they go through life, they risk basing their knowledge, understanding and opinions on sources that perpetuate inaccurate and misleading stereotypes. If and when those prejudices and falsehoods surface in the classroom, well trained teachers of RE are equipped to challenge and correct them. \"With information and opinion so freely available on social media and other online sources, pupils need to be taught to differentiate between sources that are reliable and reputable and those that are more likely to lead to religious discrimination and hatred. \"It is clear that in Britain today, we need to develop a better understanding of different faiths and beliefs so that we build more cohesive communities. In a world where religious literacy is now a vital skill in all walks of life, the shortage of qualified RE teachers is a deep concern and needs to be urgently addressed.\"  What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Religious education remains compulsory at each key stage for all state-funded schools, including academies and free schools, and we expect all schools to fulfil their statutory duties. \"In addition, we have changed the law and the requirements in schools so that they have to actively promote mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.\" A spokesman for the Welsh government said: \"We are currently reforming the way in which initial teacher education is delivered - putting in place new accreditation criteria and strengthening the ways in which schools and universities work together. \"An advisory board has also been established to consider issues of teacher recruitment and retention. \"We believe that this, together with a new curriculum, a new approach to our foundation phase and a commitment to professional learning will help us attract the very best teachers.\"   ",

In his first public speech since taking up the post, Mr Hinds said schools needed a mix of traditional academic subjects and a sense of \"resilience\" and skills such as public speaking. Mr Hinds said that a high proportion of new jobs would require digital skills. He also called for improvements in vocational training for adults. The education secretary said young people needed the skills to be able to \"write apps\" as well as being able to use them.    He said lessons in computing were needed to prepare young people for industries being changed by artificial intelligence and the arrival of technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Speaking at the Education World Forum in London, Mr Hinds emphasised the need for both \"core academic subjects\" and other, \"soft skills\" that could make young people more employable.  'Sports and voluntary work' But in his first presentation since becoming education secretary in the recent ministerial reshuffle, he gave few clues about any significant change in direction. Instead, Mr Hinds focused on how schools needed to prepare people for a shifting jobs market - and the importance of skills in communication and developing character. \"I would suggest that there is nothing soft about these skills,\" he told this international education gathering. \"The hard reality of soft skills is, actually, these things around the workplace, and these things around character and resilience are important for anybody to achieve in life, as well as for the success of our economy,\" said Mr Hinds. He stressed the importance of the \"ethos of a school, the expectations set for students\" and activities such as \"sport, public speaking and voluntary work\". Mr Hinds said these would shape the \"character, resilience and workplace skills that our young people take with them\". The new education secretary also pointed to the importance of helping adults to retrain for a changing jobs market. The conference heard that the UK's economy could receive a huge financial boost if there were improvements in the levels of basic skills. Andreas Schleicher, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) director of education, said that a fifth of 15-year-olds in the UK struggled to achieve even the most basic levels in maths and reading. \"If the United Kingdom were to ensure that all students had at least basic skills, the economic gains could reach $3.6 trillion (\\xa32.58trn) in additional income for the economy over the working life of these students,\" he told the conference. On the basis of standards rising in other countries, Mr Schleicher said: \"Such improvements in educational performance are entirely realistic.\"   ",

            "article": " H. Fred Walker stood before his Edinboro University community on a recent snowy day and issued a warning. ,  cWe have been very insular in that we have not looked beyond the boundaries of Edinboro, the college president told a group of staff and students who had gathered at a meeting in this town tucked away in Northwestern Pennsylvania to hear the details of the college 9s strategic plan. cWhen we 9re judged against our peers, it 9s a punch in the eye for us. , While it was difficult for many in the room to hear, it was a reality years in the making for Edinboro, a four-year public university with an enrollment of about 6,000 students that is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. In the last decade, enrollment has plummeted, faculty salaries have caused expenses to skyrocket and completion rates have dissipated. , No longer is the school 9s most promising pipeline the average teenager going to college for the first time, but more likely the adult who may need to go back for a second or third. After 160 years as an anchor of rural Pennsylvania, the university is becoming obsolete. ,  cThere 9s a reckoning that has to come, Mr. Walker said in an interview in early March. , For Mr. Walker, the reckoning came just a few weeks later. He resigned on March 27 after he enraged faculty and students with comments he made about his reform tactics to the The Chronicle of Higher Education(https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Tough-Talking- President/242843). , It is one of the most striking, but not unusual, signs of tumult gripping higher education institutions across the nation as they look for ways to thrive in the next century. Edinboro is among many colleges and universities facing a gloomy picture 4 painted by polls, politics and population shifts 4 that are forcing an overhaul of campuses. Amid a growing disillusionment with higher education, thousands of institutions are seeking ways to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape that has been destabilized by skeptics, an impatient work force and a fierce conservative populace streak. , For colleges, that means re-examining centuries worth of practice. At Edinboro, that means gone are the days of educating for education 9s sake. , Edinboro 9s provost, Michael J. Hannan **,** who started as an assistant professor at the university 30 years ago, will lead the school on an interim basis, and he has signaled that he plans to follow the course set by Mr. Walker. cI have every confidence that we will address our present challenges, guided by our values and an unwavering commitment to our students, Mr. Hannan wrote in a statement to the school community following Mr. Walker 9s resignation. , Mr. Hannan said the university had been ignoring signs for at least a decade when, even amid a demographic downturn, it was building new dormitories instead of bracing for the market changes. cUnfortunately, in our case, there was no concerted, strategic effort and we 9re trying to change that at this point, he said in an interview as provost. cI don 9t know if we thought we 9d be the exception. , In Washington, congressional Republicans have set their sights on the Higher Education Act(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/house- republican-higher-education-bill-obama.html) 4 the law governing the nation 9s roughly 4,000 colleges and universities 4 to dismantle what they see as bloated, liberal-leaning bureaucracies that have left 6 million unfilled jobs and over $1 trillion in student debt. Elite institutions like the Ivy Leagues have already experienced the effects of the backlash, after they were targeted with an endowment tax in a sweeping Republican tax bill(https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/12/18/large-endowments-would- be-taxed-under-final-gop-tax-plan) passed by Congress in December. President Trump has even called for vocational schools to replace community colleges. , The efforts are driven in part by a 20-point divide between Democrats and Republicans in their confidence in colleges, shown in the most recent Gallup Poll(http://news.gallup.com/poll/216278/why-republicans-down- higher.aspx?g_source=HIGHER_EDUCATION&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles) that assesses attitudes in the country toward higher education. The results are clear: no longer is a college degree the crucible it once was. ,  cToo many Americans, particularly working-class Americans, are not sure that the return on investment is as high as it could be anymore, said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education. cAnd that 9s where we have to do a better job. ,  **READ MORE** : Middle-Class Families Increasingly Look to Community Colleges(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/community- colleges-middle-class-families.html) , Among both political parties, the chief reasons for losing faith in higher education are a cause for concern. Democrats cite college 9s rising costs while Republicans, 58 percent of whom said that college has had a negative impact on society(http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/20 /republicans-skeptical-of-colleges-impact-on-u-s-but-most-see-benefits-for- workforce-preparation/), think colleges are too ideological. ,  cThe effect of this divide on views of higher education 4 a pivotal element of the American dream for so many 4 raises questions about the future of higher education in this country, a Gallup analysis said. , That is particularly true for universities like Edinboro, which have thrived on their ability to convince white, working-class families that their limited resources were well spent sending their teenagers to be shaped into the next generation of great thinkers. Now, with shifting demands, Edinboro and other universities are looking at eliminating several programs that have traditionally carried that goal, a move that some call the next war on the liberal arts. , This shows the self-referential style of higher education driven by faculty with Ph.D.s is waning, said Mark Schneider, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who wrote the study  cSaving the Liberal Arts(https://www.aei.org/multimedia/saving-the-liberal-arts-bridging-the- divide-between-education-and-employment/) with Matthew Sigelman, chief executive of Burning Glass Technologies. ,  cAll of a sudden, you woke up one day and students were dropping English majors because they want jobs, Mr. Schneider said. , Among the programs being cut (http://www.goerie.com/news/20180321/what- programs-majors-will-edinboro-university-cut)at Edinboro are degrees in music, geography and a master 9s in social science. The university will add programs like a master of business administration and a bachelor 9s of science degree in health sciences. , Mr. Hannan said the school was sensitive to preserving liberal arts majors 4 like political science and history 4 in its review, though some specialties would be discontinued. cWithout some of those programs, you have to question whether or not you are a university, Mr. Hannan said. cBut for better or worse, many students are career-minded, and we have to respond to that. , The university plans to emphasize co-curricular activities, leadership and life skills, and experiential learning opportunities in its new plan. It will also double the size and budget of its career center. , Nationally, Gallup polling shows that colleges have been particularly slow to recognize the demand for work force preparation said Mr. Schneider, pointing to the 16 percent of students who reported(http://news.gallup.com/poll/199307/one-six-grads-say-career- services-helpful.aspx) using career centers on college campuses, and found them useful. , While the evidence of the benefits of higher education has never been more pronounced, the prevalence of stories about the lack of jobs and high student loan debt have put colleges on notice. , But it wouldn 9t be the first time. The demise of colleges and universities has been forecast time and again, Mr. Hartle said. And higher education is often targeted as a culprit of societal misgivings, usually during the most politically divisive eras 4 they emerged in narratives during the Communist hearings and Vietnam protests. ,  cAnything that 9s been around in the same place, doing the same function for 150 years has shown it can change, Mr. Hartle said. cBut nobody can be comfortable, and any institution that assumes that past success guarantees the future is being foolish. , Besides, higher education is facing a new threat in the business of creating and transmitting information. , That keeps Joseph E. Aoun, president of Northeastern University in Boston, up at night. While other presidents in local college towns worry about competing for endowments and enrollment, Mr. Aoun sees another threat: robots. , More than the latest polls, he is driven by a 2013 Oxford University Study (https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)that predicted that nearly half of the jobs in the United States are at risk of being taken over by computers within the next two decades. cWe said if robots are going to replace human beings we need to help students to be robot-proof,(https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/robot-proof) and we built a strategic plan around that, Mr. Aoun said. , That thinking positioned Mr. Aoun on the fringe of higher education strategizing just a few years ago, but he is now called on weekly to advise other institutions on how to help their students outsmart the workers of the future. , He calls this strategy humanics 4 a staple of Northeastern 9s program that requires computer science majors to take theater classes. The idea is to give students the ability to solve the world 9s most pressing problems in a way that robots cannot 4 with empathy. Or as he puts it: cI haven 9t seen a computer that weeps. , During his 12-year tenure, Mr. Aoun has essentially turned over the reins of the institution to students and employers. The school 9s acclaimed cooperative education and career development program, called Co- op(https://www.northeastern.edu/coop/), sends more than 90 percent of its students into paying jobs around the world. Students complete two Co-ops, sometimes three, over the course of their college careers, for six months at a time. , While other colleges are trying to get their students to use the career center, Northeastern has students in companies in 136 countries and on every continent, including Antarctica. cThe students are the ones who are in tune with the world, Mr. Aoun said. cThey 9re bringing the experience to us, and getting us out of our comfort zone. , The urban campus is described as having a cworkaholic vibe, and a running joke is that nobody looks twice at a student walking around campus in a suit. Chaitri Gulati, a third-year student at Northeastern, was drawn to the school because of the Co-op program, and because csitting in class would not just be for the sake of taking examinations and intellectual enrichment. , Ms. Gulati, who is studying economics and political science, is at Wellington Management 9s London office, where she is working with an investment team, and more important, applying theoretical concepts learned in her classes to understanding the investment process. cThe more such experiences I have, the more I learn what role I wish to play now but also later in life, Ms. Gulati said. , Northeastern is not hurting for students: it has posted record application numbers for the past nine years and last fall got 62,000 applications for 2,800 freshman seats. But Mr. Aoun is hoping to meet another demand 4 what Northeastern calls the lifetime learner. For too long, Mr. Aoun said, lifelong learning had been deemed a csecond-class operation. , A recent poll(http://news.gallup.com/poll/226868/workers-unsure-securing- training-takes-jobs.aspx) conducted by Northeastern and Gallup found that only 37 percent of workers said that if they lost their job to a machine they would turn to a college or university for retraining. Mr. Aoun hopes to lure more of those potential students. , Where others see a challenge, Mr. Aoun sees an opportunity. cThere 9s a lot of anxiety right now, he said. cBut I believe we 9re in the golden age of higher education. , Edinboro University, on the other hand, is trying to climb out of the Dark Ages. The overhaul will touch virtually every corner of the college, starting with who walks through the door. , The school toughened admissions requirements to weed out local students who have traditionally turned to Edinboro as their only education option. It is a painful reality, but so are their outcomes. Though the college has accepted nearly everyone who applied, its enrollment has plummeted nearly 30 percent in the last five years. It has a 38 percent attrition rate, and poor four-year and six-year graduation rates, at 27 percent and 49 percent. , The admissions move seems counterproductive, given that it is sure to result in fewer students. Already, Edinboro stands to be among the hardest hit in its region by demographic shifts that will see declining high school graduates and fewer births. But the school has set its sights on a new group of students 4 specifically, the 100,000 adults who have been identified by a state analysis(http://www.passhe.edu/inside/bog/pages/gap-analysis-reports.aspx) who are living in the region who have completed some college but not obtained a degree. , Marc Sylvester, president of Edinboro 9s faculty union, said the faculty supported key elements of Edinboro 9s plan forward, including raising admission standards and overhauling program offerings. , But, Mr. Sylvester said, more important than a plan was for the campus to have faith in the leader implementing it. cThere are changes that need to be made, he said. cAnd we also need to respect our traditions. Otherwise, we 9re losing our identity. ** d**  ",

His school district, which contains some of the poorest pupils\\xa0in the nation, has been under state control since 2001, an arrangement that will end this year. Proficiency in reading and maths lags about 30 percentage points behind the rest of the state. To boost results the district has turned to proliferating charter schools, which receive public funds but have independent management and now educate one in three children in the district. Twenty-one low-performing public schools, christened cRenaissance schools d, have been turned over to charter operators. At a school-board meeting on February 15th vocal charter supporters, mostly black parents frustrated with poor local schools, confronted angry, mostly white, teachers.  cI can 9t and I won 9t let my sons down, testified Rasheeda Fossey, whose children are in the school system. After a lawyer for charter schools finished speaking, teachers booed and hissed cBullshit d. Mr Hite, trapped in the middle of the squabble, says his role is cto ensure high-quality schools and cnot ask what kind of school it is d. \\xa0Charters are chafing under the district 9s supervision, which they see as biased, while the teachers 9 union operates in a state of war. The expansion of charter schools represents ca concerted effort to dismantle public education as we know it d, says Jerry Jordan, the president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

That is despite the appointment of Betsy DeVos, a longtime funder of school-choice efforts, as secretary of education. The federal government pays for less than 10% of public-school funds. Control is devolved to states and school districts, leaving the education secretary rather weak in setting policy. At a recent breakfast put on by school-choice advocates on Capitol Hill for Republican congressional staffers, Ms DeVos was not mentioned once. She may have had more influence as a deep-pocketed donor, who helped the rapid expansion in charter schools in Michigan, than as education secretary. States, especially those governed by Republicans, are expanding schemes such as vouchers and education savings accounts, where the state transfers cash directly to parents. Spending on such programmes, which now include 470,000 children, has tripled as a share of education expenses in the past ten years, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group.\\xa0Charter schools now educate 3.1m pupils, a sevenfold increase since 2000. In New Orleans, which rebuilt its woeful education system after Hurricane Katrina, 93% of pupils are now educated in charters, where they have made considerable improvement. Other urban school districts are not as far along as New Orleans, but many are emulating it. Cities like Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Washington, where 46% of pupils are enrolled in charters, are examples of a growing cportfolio model movement. Under this approach, school districts treat their charter and traditional public-school offerings much as stock-pickers do their financial portfolios, by strenuously monitoring performance and quickly ridding themselves of low-performing assets. Rather than creating unfettered markets, where the ready availability of public cash can attract unscrupulous providers, technocrats wield a heavy cudgel 4the threat of closure 4to force accountability. The financial analogy of cportfolio model d, and its association with Michael Bloomberg when he was mayor of New York City, has made the term pejorative among those who talk of education being privatised. But the portfolio model is actually less like a pure market in education, because it takes choices away from parents, many of whom are attached to their local school, no matter how mediocre. Paul Hill, the intellectual progenitor of the portfolio model, reckons that 40 school districts, most of them large and urban, have now adopted this method. Even with their impressive growth, charters educate only 7% of American pupils. The grand experiment can be justified on two grounds. The first is moral 4there is inherent good in being able to pick schools. cParents 9 right to choice is really the civil-rights issue of the 21st century, says John Schilling, president of the American Federation for Children, which Ms DeVos once chaired and helped found. cLow-income parents should also have the ability to send their kids where they want, he adds. The second justification for choice is pragmatic 4to spur competition and innovation which would cdrag education out of the 19th century d, as Milton Friedman put it. For this crowd, outcomes are important. But, like the traditional public schools they seek to replace, charter schools tend to produce uneven results. The best nationwide study, by researchers at Stanford University, suggests they have little overall effect on learning. Detroit 9s charters, which Ms DeVos pushed mightily, are widely seen as a mess. Students in Philadelphia 9s charters do better in reading exams, but not in maths. The evidence on school vouchers is similarly uninspiring, with little gain in test scores and only marginal increases in graduation rates. Pupils who took part in Indiana and Louisiana 9s voucher schemes posted significantly worse results than those who remained in the public-school system. Treating schools like a portfolio, where bad ones are quickly pushed out of business, might work a bit better.
