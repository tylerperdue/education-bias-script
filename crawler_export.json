The ban, which came into effect on Thursday, is part of a policy that, the government says, is in line with a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 that said teaching English may hinder the students' proficiency in Korean.  \\\"According to many English education experts and neuroscientists, the right age for learning English as a second language is the third grade,\\\" Kwon Ji- young, director of early childhood education and care policy division at the Ministry of Education, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Starting second-language education at preschool is too early. Before that, social skills and cognitive development should take place. A lot of parents think earlier the better when it comes to learning a second language.\\\"  In South Korea, kindergartens that conduct English classes are not officially registered as pre-schools but operate as private academies.

In Korean society, the more money you have, the more educated you can be,\\\" said Kim Hee- won, a private English teacher.  Kim, who has been teaching in the capital Seoul since 2003, ruled out English learning having an adverse effect on a child's proficiency in Korean.  She did, however, warn of the increase in demand for English institutions and also of the competitiveness that exists among parents.   {articleGUID}   \\\"In Korea, some mothers compare what kind of stroller they have for their kids, which hospital their child was born in and how they want to follow the trends.  \\\"The level of competition is very fierce, and they will spend a lot of money to ensure their child gets taught English.\\\"  Hwang Hee-jung, a single mother to Ko Jae-joon, agrees. Her son was born in the US and was studying in a Korean school in Seoul until last year when she transferred him to an international school.  \\\"I think speaking English is very important because the university admission exam we have\\\\xa0is very tough and students need to get a high score in English to pass,\\\" said Hwang.  \\\"In a Korean school, my son was taught English just one hour a week. Now, majority of his lessons are in English, and the more he practises, the better he will get.\\\"       ---   How an exam brings South Korea to a halt      Together with the ban, the ministry has issued a warning and reminder to Korean parents, urging them to treat English as a second language.  \\\"It's important how parents perceive English as a second language. Korean children are exposed to stressful learning conditions due to academic pressure. It even starts before they are born,\\\" said Kwon.  \\\"The Ministry tries to conduct programmes and seminars for parents to improve their perception of English education.\\\"  A Ministry of Education official, who wished to remain anonymous, said there would be plans put in place for children from low-income families.  \\\"The Ministry has plans which include offering financial help to attend English programmes and assisting schools which lack resources to create those programmes,\\\" the official said.   {articleGUID}   Mobile phone apps and online translation software are being increasingly used for basic communication.  But critics say English fluency is needed more than ever, especially in a society where long hours and extra effort often does not result in success due to the level of competition.  Korean parents will seek private lessons for their children in the aftermath, said one parent, before adding that the assurances handed out by the government will not count for much.  \\\"We will encounter the unavoidable gap between the haves and the have-nots. It's simple: No money, no opportunity, no education.

Primary education became free in 1961 and the 1980s saw major reforms swept through the education system, including restructuring primary and secondary education and introducing vocational classes.  In September 2017, the Ghanaian government made secondary education free, with\\\\xa0President\\\\xa0[Nana Akufo- Addo](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/talktojazeera/2017/11/akufo-addo- africa-march-democracy-hard-reverse-171124113644826.html)\\\\xa0reportedly saying: \\\"There will be no admission fees, no library fees, no science centre fees, no computer laboratory fees, no examination fees, no utility fees. There will be free textbooks, free boarding and free meals.\\\"  The benefits of the Ghanian government's focus on [education](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/education.html) are reflected in the country's rising literacy rate. According to UNESCO statistics from 2010, the literacy rate among 15-24-year-olds is 85.72 percent, compared with 34.89 percent in those aged 65 or older.   {articleGUID}   Despite these measures, many children, particularly those living in rural areas, struggle to stay in school.  Economic necessity forces children to drop out of school in search of work, and girls are often charged with looking after younger siblings and helping with domestic work.  NGOs are attempting to address these issues at the community level and ensure every child has access to education.  Johnson Ayonka is the director of the Grassroots Transparency Initiative at WillWay Africa, an NGO that supports low-income communities in health, education and economic empowerment.  Jo Hallett works with Ghana School Aid and Let's Read Ghana to provide grants to schools in rural communities and support the teaching of English in the far north of the country.  Al Jazeera spoke with Ayonka and Hallett about the realities of getting an education in Ghana today.   **Al Jazeera: What effect has the recent removal of secondary school fees had on both children and schools?**   **Johnson Ayonka:** It has had an impact, but because the national government is inefficient, the money from the central government doesn't always get to the communities. In the very poor communities, there is the wider problem of poverty that's forcing people to drop out, despite education being free and some schools are still charging fees because the money from the government didn't get to them.  Even though the intention behind the policy was good, the government was not well prepared to implement it to the fullest. They also tried to implement it from the centre, instead of from the local area and the money was not made available in advance. It was sort of \\\"putting the cart before the horse\\\", instead of the money being there before the policy, the policy comes and then the money.  The policy is OK, the students have enrolled because they know that they'll get free education, but after that, we find out that nothing effective takes place because what is needed is not there because of bureaucracy and inefficiency.   **Al Jazeera: What are the barriers still preventing access to education today?**   **Jo Hallett:** In the last few years, there has also been quite a push on more school buildings and a big push on enrolment and I think that [the Ghanaian government has] done very well on getting the vast majority of children into school, [but] there are huge barriers to accessing education. There's a serious lack of trained teachers. In many of the schools we go into, the majority of the staff are volunteers or student teachers.  There's a lack of finance for schools in general, so although the children are there, the buildings are not there, although overall they have improved, lots of schools have either very poor buildings or no buildings at all; they call it \\\"under the tree\\\" so classes are taught under a tree. There's a lack of equipment and a lack of books and resources, the training of teachers, finance of all sorts and that needs to be addressed.  Often the teachers don't get paid for several months because the District Education doesn't have the finance to pay them and, therefore, there's a lack of commitment on their part to some extent. Class sizes also vary enormously. A good teacher can manage quite a big class but sometimes it's overwhelming: you go into a classroom and there are 70 pupils in there and one teacher who may not be trained, who's trying to manage them and it's impossible really, it's really difficult.  > There's a lack of finance for schools in general, so although the children are there, the buildings are not there ... lots of schools have either very poor buildings or no buildings at all.\\\\r > > Jo Hallett, NGO worker > >   **  Al Jazeera: How are rural communities affected?**   **Hallett:** In many rural areas, the families are involved in subsistence farming or illegal mining and, with farming, the children get pulled out of school for harvest and sewing.  Another really significant thing that we see is the complete lack of spoken English in the rural areas. In school, after the first couple of years, the education is in English. There are 52 languages in Ghana, but the common language, and the language of government, [and] the language they're expected to learn in is English.  If you live in a town, the chances are that you will see English sometimes and hear it, but out in the rural areas where we go in the far north, they speak a language called Guruni, which is spoken in a very small area, and it's not written down at all so there aren't any signposts or posters so [children] don't have text in the environment, either in their own language or in English.   **Al Jazeera: Do girls face additional challenges to entering education?**   **Ayonka:** \\\\xa0At the primary level the gender gap is small, it's very, very small, and that indicates that a lot of progress has been made in the education of girls. But as girls mature into their teenage years, they face a lot of challenges because there's a lot of gender disparity in terms of who should do house chores, so girls suffer more.   {articleGUID}   When you get closer to higher levels of education, even though the gap has reduced over the years, it's still there because cultural factors come into play and there are issues of early marriage and families spending more on boys than on girls.  We need something to address that gap because it will relieve the economic aspects of education and leave the responsibility to the government so that families don't have to decide: \\\"Are we going to educate the boy and leave the girl out? Or are we going to educate both?\\\"   **Al Jazeera: What steps should the government take now?**   **Ayonka:** What we see recently from the government is that a lot of policies and actions are done in isolation. Let's say you see an area where there's a high instance of teenage pregnancy and you don't also make arrangements for the education authorities to work with the healthcare authorities and social workers; even though there's free education, you are still going to get low enrolment because there is no coordination.  Another problem is the issue of access to the education infrastructure, there's free education on paper but the schools are few, especially in the rural areas. You can say you want to give free education to people but if you don't give them physical access to the schools by building more schools, then you still don't have free education ... I think communities need to be empowered to build their own schools, to recruit their own teachers, monitor the teachers and make sure that the standard of education is high.  There's a big gap between what is happening at the government level and what is happening at the community level.   **Hallett:\\\\xa0** There needs to be a bigger commitment to funding and a raising of the status of teachers. [The government] has done some really good things, some of the curriculum books are excellent, but they also need to have a bit of money and resources to back up that commitment, but I do think Ghana is trying hard. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Q&A: The reality of free education for all in Ghana\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/qa-reality-free-education-ghana-180219070207774.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Rabat, Morocco -** Overcrowding, the lack of an efficient strategy and poor administration are harming public schools in [Morocco](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/morocco.html)\\\\xa0and diminishing the opportunities available to underprivileged children, experts, teachers and students have told Al Jazeera.  The crisis in the education sector comes despite repeated efforts by successive governments to reform the archaic system.  Meanwhile, social disparity is widening with the growth of private schools as higher-income families increasingly opt to pay for better services, threatening those who rely on free and quality education.  Despite high tuition costs, the number of those shifting from public to private schools soared from 4 percent in 1999 to 15 percent in 2015.  A World Economic Forum report in 2015 placed Morocco at 101 out of 140 countries in a quality of education index.  According to a 2014 Unesco report, Morocco was ranked among the 21 worst countries in the field of education, with more than half of students in public schools failing to acquire necessary reading and maths skills.  > It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career.\\\\r > > Anas Mrabti, high school student > >   Morocco's King Mohammed VI has highlighted the dire situation on several occasions.  \\\"The education system faces many difficulties and problems especially due to adopting some programmes and educational curricula, which do not suit the requirements of the labour market,\\\" King Mohammed said in a speech on August 20, 2013.  \\\"The current situation in the education and training sectors requires an assessment process that measures achievements and identifies the weaknesses and imbalances,\\\" he added.  Anas Mrabti, a high school student at a public school in Rabat, expressed concern over the future of underprivileged pupils.  \\\"It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career,\\\" he told Al Jazeera. \\\"The majority of students at public schools come from poor families, who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools. The dilemma is that there is a big gap between the public and private schools in terms of quality education and services.\\\"  He added that financial disparities could affect higher education.  \\\"Students from public schools find it very difficult to compete with students from private schools to access reputable institutions and universities. Parents normally send their kids to private schools because they know that those schools can earn their kids higher marks,\\\" he said.  Because privately-educated children usually attain better grades, it becomes \\\"very difficult for students from public schools to \\\\u2026 access major universities and institutions,\\\" said the student.\\\\xa0   'Students not equipped'   ****In recent years, successive governments have tried to implement structural adjustments to increase access to education and improve the education system's performance, the latest of which is the Council of Education's \\\"Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School\\\".  This strategy was first implemented in 2015 and is expected to continue until 2030.\\\\xa0  But so far, there have been few solutions.  According to Mohammed, a headmaster of a public school in Tetouan who declined to give his last name, \\\"the educational field has been suffering for a while from the gap between theory and practice, and of the gap between ideas and application\\\".  He told Al Jazeera: \\\"Students are not equipped with the practical skills they need to integrate them into the job market.  \\\"Our public schools are like buildings lacking pillars that keep them standing. Any major reform bid needs to transform goals into practical solutions.\\\"  An academic researcher, who preferred not to give his name, agreed that the Ministry of Education's previous and current attempts at reform were superficial.  \\\"All reform attempts were inspired by Western models that do not take into consideration the possibility of application, and whether the country is ready to apply such reforms on ground.  \\\"The country has its own identity and characteristics. The setup of any effective reform plan can only be achieved through a participatory approach that should include academics, educational syndicates, researchers and trainers.  \\\"Securing logistics and funding are not enough to ensure good educational quality. Public schools used to enjoy a good reputation in the past, and the authorities in this country should restore that dignity by finding solutions for such a vital sector.\\\"  Mohamed Jouji, a retired father who has two daughters in private schools, said Morocco is far from achieving its goals in the public education sector.  \\\"The issues are mainly school dropouts, weak numbers of schooling in the rural world, the high illiteracy rate, and the deterioration of educational performance,\\\" Jouji told Al Jazeera.   The end of free education?   ****Another headache added to the Moroccan burden is a new draft bill introduced by the government, which aims at putting an end to free education in the kingdom.  The bill proposes that preschool, primary and secondary education should remain free of charge for all Moroccans, but suggests registration fees for high schools and universities for middle and high-income families.  The draft law has angered parents and education syndicates, who consider the move a violation of Moroccan citizens' right to free education. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How an education crisis is hurting Morocco's poor\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/education-crisis-hurting-morocco-poor-180306225706337.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Clara Ponsati, Catalonia's former education minister, has turned herself in to authorities in Scotland and is facing extradition to Spain.

It is, of course, unacceptable for any woman to receive less than a man for the same job, in any walk of life or career path. But where equal pay and rights would make the greatest material difference - to education, to health and to economic progress - is at the sharp end of inequality: not in Hollywood, but with rural women in developing countries.  These are the women who make up more than 40 percent of the [agricultural workforce](http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/am307e/am307e00.pdf), performing labour-intensive tasks like raising livestock and hand-weeding, working much longer hours than men when domestic duties are taken into account. Yet these are also the same women often blocked from [land ownership](https://farmingfirst.org/women_infographic/), who get just five percent of agricultural support services, 10 percent of agricultural aid, and can access a fraction of the credit available to invest in their farms and families.\\\\xa0  The difference that just a little extra income or support can make goes beyond the noble goal of equality. Increasing a woman's income by just $10 has the [same positive effect](https://farmingfirst.org/women_infographic/) on her children's nutrition and health as increasing a man's income by $110.  > Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet. But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   And with equal access to the same resources as men, the benefits stretch even further to transforming millions of lives and prospects. Women farmers typically produce 20-30 percent less than men per hectare, not because they are less efficient but because they have less access to training, credit and inputs like improved seeds and fertilizer.  By giving women the same opportunities as men, total agricultural output could be boosted by an additional four percent. This is equivalent of ending malnutrition for up to 150 million people in the world.  The value of closing the gender gap in agriculture has been demonstrated in places like Bangladesh, where a Dutch-funded project helps train female farmers to become local leaders, or Farm Business Advisors (FBA).  Led by [iDE and partners](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.ideglobal.org/files/public/IDE- B_PROOFS_Photobook-2017.pdf?mtime=20170531154634), these FBAs develop networks across the agricultural supply chain to help farmers better access key materials and markets, and generate more income. It has helped women like [Jahanara Begum](https://farmingfirst.org/2018/03/fillthegap-joining-up-women- for-a-common-goal-in-bangladesh/), 45, bridge the gender gap not only by developing her own seed-selling business and unlocking new credit lines, but by equipping her to support other farmers across more than 250 producer groups.\\\\xa0  The project organises activities like post-harvest training between buyers and other market players to raise the value of crops, and in turn raise profit margins. In total, the project has seen more than 63,000 households move out of poverty with an increase in income per capita of around $420.  Meanwhile, women account for just a quarter of landowners with official rights in [Mozambique](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/mozambique.html). But when major agricultural trading company EMCL began to recruit and train young women like [Josefina dos Santos Lourenco](https://farmingfirst.org/2018/03 /fillthegap-making-queens-in-mozambique/) to manage their input supply shops, they were able to simultaneously expand their businesses and begin to address the agricultural gender gap.  Thanks to training in bookkeeping and marketing carried out in partnership with Fintrac and USAID, Josefina's inputs shop is now serving almost 1,000 farmers with essential products from appropriate fertilizers to improved seed. \\\"Today, I'm not only financially independent, but also my family is receiving lots of respect in my area,\\\" she told staff at Fintrac.  And in [Colombia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/colombia.html), where women make up 40 percent of the cocoa growers' association COMCACAOT, USAID's Rural Finance Initiative (RFI) has helped re-balance the gender pay gap by helping [individual farmers access loans](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MJHG.pdf). RFI supported COMCACAOT, an organisation that is only five years old, through targeted technical assistance and organizational development training prior submitting a loan request to Banco Agrario de Colombia.  COMCACAOT was able to vouch for 374 of its members, most of whom were women. For female members like Lidia Grueso, who herself had already overcome gender barriers to become a manager of COMCACAOT, such support to access credit allows women to afford critical farm inputs and to pay the staff harvesting the cocoa.  Meanwhile, to reduce the burden of unpaid domestic work for rural women, policy network [FANRPAN](https://www.fanrpan.org/) is working in [Ethiopia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html) and [Tanzania](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/tanzania.html) to make men aware of the need to participate more in household budgeting and chores. Following behaviour change workshops in several villages, men have begun to play a more active role in tending home gardens, collecting water and even attending the village cooking classes. By bringing men into this domain, the often overlooked hours that women work at home can be reduced, bridging yet another aspect of the gender gap facing female farmers.  Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet. But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields. A level playing field for rural women can help plant the seeds for a better life for not only for female farmers and their families, but the entire developing world.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Bridging the gender pay gap, on the red carpet and in the fields\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/bridging-gender-pay-gap-red-carpet-fields-180308124732679.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ On my first day of college, the official who interviewed me for admission sat me down on the steps of the student centre, a newly renovated building surrounded by lush landscaping and stately ivy-covered buildings.

Yet her words came back to me over the course of my four years, and again in graduate school, and even now, fourteen years later, as I move through New York City as a professional.\\\\xa0  Class ascendance led me to become what Susan Jacoby classifies in her recent New York Times Op-Ed \\\"[Stop Apologizing for Being Elite](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/opinion/sunday/elites-stop- apologizing.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&smtyp=cur)\\\" as an \\\"elite\\\": a vague description of a group of people who have received advanced degrees. Jacoby urges elites to reject the shame that they have supposedly recently developed, a shame that somehow stems from failing to stop the working class from embracing Trumpism. Jacoby laments that, following the [2016 election](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election-2016.html), these elites no longer take pride in their wealth, their education, their social status, and posits that if only elites embraced their upward mobility, the working class would have something to aspire to and thus discard their fondness for Trump and his promises to save them.  Jacoby's strategy for elevating the working class is not only ahistorical, it's also rooted in a class dynamic that simply does not exist. [As I have argued in the past](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/11/working- class-trump-suppress-161112142432583.html), the working class is not responsible for the rise of Trump. White America, regardless of class status, put Trump in power. Moreover, the working class is a carefully designed byproduct of policy and culture that creates and maintains the ruling class. To be \\\"elite\\\" relies on differentiating oneself from the masses. Wealth and socioeconomic mobility for the elite come at the expense of the working class. It's, therefore, more than strange that Jacoby imagines the rich as the intellectual philanthropists catering to the vacuous working people who just need a little knowledge from above.  > Jacoby's pull yourself up by the bootstraps, trickle-down approach to culture and intellectualism discounts the long legacy and history-in-making of working-class organising against austerity.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   College was the first moment where I truly experienced how wealthy and upwardly mobile people lived. I came from an immigrant family that oscillated between working class and truly poor. The electricity was often cut off, rent checks were late, money was perpetually tight, and in my earliest years in the US, we lived with a revolving door of cousins and relatives, 12 to a four- bedroom house. But I went to good, if overcrowded, New York City public schools and my parents had some time to help with homework. I received good grades, participated in extracurricular activities, got a steady job at the age of 14, and was accepted to excellent colleges. Once I arrived on campus, I struggled. There were few working-class kids at my well-regarded liberal arts school, and even fewer working-class students of colour. Though my public school education had been very good, it was not as rigorous as the schooling my peers had received at expensive private institutions. I found myself working twice as hard for little return. On top of the stress of coursework, the cost of textbooks and computer access meant I was constantly juggling which books I could get away with buying last, or which I could borrow from the library, at the cost of losing points for late assignments. The few students I knew with similar backgrounds had the same experience. I saw many who were unable to pay the cost of tuition leave school and go back home. In the end, I graduated on time and went on to receive a Master's degree from an Ivy League university. Even with two degrees from excellent schools, I spent almost a year working minimum-wage service jobs, saddled with debt, before I found a salaried full-time position that paid $35,000 a year in New York City. Despite my entree into the world of the \\\"elite\\\", I was still solidly working class.  We currently live in a moment of American history in which a college education [does not guarantee entry to the middle class](https://www.brookings.edu/blog /social-mobility-memos/2016/02/19/a-college-degree-is-worth-less-if-you-are- raised-poor/), where upward mobility comes with more hoops and obstacles than it has since the vast expansion of the middle class in the postwar period. The sheer definition of who constitutes the working class is shifting, as has been made evident by the [teachers' strikes](https://t.co/aAV9FfgVB1) in West Virginia and Oklahoma. This is especially true for young people of colour. Young people of colour who attend college [still earn less](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps- persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/) than their white counterparts. And despite high degrees of educational attainment, wealth in these communities is at an [all-time low](http://www.ips-dc.org/report-the-road-to-zero-wealth/). Jacoby's assertion that a college education will lead to class ascendance is patently false, and her claim that the working class is responsible for the rise of [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile- president-donald-trump-161109050153947.html) is an offensive argument, one that allows the white, upper-middle-class readership of the New York Times to wash its hands of the role it plays in creating the class frissions that the author laments - through creating and supporting policies that have kept the rich wealthy, the middle class dwindling, and the poor immiserated.  Jacoby's pull yourself up by the bootstraps, trickle-down approach to culture and intellectualism discounts the long legacy and history-in-making of working-class organising against austerity. In other words, the material gains that poor and working-class people have made come via direct resistance to the rich. She positions the working class as the creators of the Trump era and the elites as heroes in the making, when, in fact, elites are the architects of this political moment. Jacoby is correct in that elites must stop apologising for their education and their status. Beyond apology, what the upper middle class and, in particular, the white upper middle class, owes to this country is a claim of responsibility - responsibility in creating and profiteering from a financial crisis that led to ballooning student debt and stagnant wages, [which especially impacts communities of colour](http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/mar/07/student-loan-debt-crisis- civil-rights-issue/), and responsibility in allowing this nation to become one of the most unequal countries on the planet, all to retain some sort of status as \\\"elite\\\".\\\\xa0  I'm now comfortably middle class. I have debt but I also have a stable income and I'm putting my degrees to work. I know that my class ascendance is not hinged solely on my college education, but on systemic factors (for instance, I'm a documented South Asian immigrant in the US and the child of a college educated parent). As a member of the \\\"elite\\\" that Jacoby refers to, I know that my success was built on the labour of the working classes who fought for people like me. And it's time for those of us who \\\"made it\\\" to carry on that legacy by dismantling the systems that make elitism possible.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Trickle down elitism does not help the working class\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/trickle-elitism-working-class-180320123323326.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ The [Central European University](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/04/hungary-shut- university-170405104057150.html), a Hungarian-American school that has been under fire from Hungary's right-wing government, plans to open a satellite campus in Vienna, Austria.\\\\xa0  \\\"The memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Vienna, which will be presented to our Board of Trustees at the end of this week, is an initial step towards expanding our university's operations,\\\"\\\\xa0said a statement from CEU.

On October 1, 2017, millions of Catalans voted in a referendum, with the large majority of voters supporting independence. That same day, violence unfolded as the government in Madrid tried to stop the vote from happening.  In the weeks following the referendum,\\\\xa0Puigdemont inched closer to his goal for his homeland, becoming the unlikely leader of a movement that started in a tiny town in the Catalan province of Girona.  Almost four weeks after the referendum, Catalonia officially [declared independence](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/catalan-parliament-begins- vote-independence-171027115908493.html), with the Spanish government in Madrid immediately triggering Article 155, which allows the national government to take direct control of\\\\xa0[Catalonia](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/catalonia.html).  A day later, the Spanish government dismissed Puigdemont and his cabinet, calling for new regional elections on December 21.\\\\xa0  Puigdemont and a handful of other Catalan ministers then left Barcelona for Belgium, where they remain.\\\\xa0  Spain has [issued an international arrest warrant](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/barcelona-politicians-demand- release-catalans-171103124456934.html) for the Catalan leaders.\\\\xa0  Puigdemont was the driving force behind Catalonia declaring independence on October 27. But who is the now sacked Catalan leader?  [ Catalonia referendum: Who are the Catalans? ](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/catalonia-referendum- catalans-171001083248355.html)  He was born on December 29, 1962, in the Catalan region. At 16, he started working as a reporter for the local newspaper Diari de Girona.  At the University of Girona, Puigdemont studied Catalan philosophy. But he dropped out of university to become a full-time journalist.  After working for years for the now-defunct newspaper El Punt, he became its editor-in-chief in 1988. He wrote for the journal, Presencia and also founded the English-language magazine, Catalonia Today.  In 2006, Puigdemont left journalism to join a Catalan electoral alliance, which later turned into a pro-independence movement. Because of his background in communication, he also helped establish the Catalan News Agency, a \\\"digital native\\\" mouthpiece for the Catalan movement.\\\\xa0  In 2011, he was elected mayor of Girona, the capital of the province of the same name. He was the first politician in 32 years to break the Socialist Party of Catalonia's dominance in the city.\\\\xa0       ---   [THE LISTENING POST: Catalonia referendum - One country, two stories (25:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Q-vnnG_nI&t=2s)     Puigdemont further burnished his political credentials among Catalans by becoming chairman of the Association of Municipalities for Independence and being elected a member of the regional parliament.  On January 10, 2016, he was elected president of Catalonia. He is the first Catalan president to not declare an oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution and the current king, Felipe VI.  Amid criticism from the central government in Madrid for his role in the referendum, Puigdemont managed to push for the vote in the Catalan parliament. The voting was declared unconstitutional by the country's courts.  However, Puigdemont and his supporters were defiant as he pushed for the region's second referendum on independence in three years. Of those that cast their ballots, a majority voted in favour of independence, leading to a political crisis in [Spain](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/spain.html).  On October 27, Catalonia's future once again caused turmoil after the region [declared independence](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/catalan- parliament-begins-vote-independence-171027115908493.html) from Spain.\\\\xa0  Several hours after the declaration, Puigdemont was fired, and his regional government dissolved. The future of Puigdemont and the Catalan independence project is now uncertain.  The day after the declaration, the Spanish prime minister dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for new regional elections on 21 December 2017.  On 30 October Puigdemont and other members of the Catalan government were charged with rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, charges that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years.  On the same day, Puigdemont and five other Catalan ministers fled to Belgium, having left Catalonia right after the charges were laid.  Puigdemont claimed he had gone to \\\"the capital of Europe\\\" to speak from a position of \\\"freedom and safety\\\". He said that he wouldn't return to Spain unless he was guaranteed a fair trial.   On 7 December 2017, about 45,000 Catalan protesters descended on Brussels in support of the exiled president. The protests took place outside EU institutions aiming to put pressure on EU institutions to support the region's cause.  While remaining in self-exile, Puigdemont contested the regional elections on 21 December and was re-elected to Parliament. In the election, Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament.  After the election, Puigdemont called for new unconditional talks with the Spanish government and proposed to meet Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy outside Spain, but the latter rejected the offer.  On 25 March 2018, while travelling from Finland to Brussels by car, Puigdemont was [detained by German police](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03 /catalonia-leader-carles-puigdemont-detained-germany-180325105531050.html) on the border with Denmark.

In 2013, she and her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, a teacher and rights activist, founded the Malala Fund, which champions the right of every girl to 12 years of free and safe education.

In an escalation, a leader of the far-right group, Forza Nuova, was recently tied up and beaten on the streets of Palermo, while two Power to the People activists were stabbed and assaulted as they were putting up electoral posters in Perugia, a city in central Italy.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/27/1cf547fcd0864dd78c74a904bb70ba8f_18.jpg)  ---  Artists have decorated the outer walls of the former hospital [Ylenia Gostoli/Al Jazeera]     Back at the OPG centre, helpdesk worker Saverio, a philosophy graduate, listens to the story of an Ivorian opposition supporter who has fled his country.

The training programme was not part of our course and we never thought we would actually use this skill on the job - until one of our classmates, Ivan Flores, used it to help save a man's life while reporting in the South Bronx.  Statistics show that many more journalists can find themselves in a similar situation in the near future. The US is in the middle of an opioid epidemic.\\\\xa0According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2016,\\\\xa0[more than 42,000 people](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html)\\\\xa0died as result of an opioid overdose in the country.\\\\xa0 Today, more people than ever before are dying from opioid overdoses, and [according to experts](https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/27/opioid-deaths-forecast/),\\\\xa0i n the worst case scenario, opioids could kill nearly half a million people across the US over the next decade. \\\\xa0  Whatever happens, journalists will be covering it, and some, like our friend Ivan, will encounter overdoses while doing so.    **Why I carry an anti-overdose kit with me while reporting in America**   _by Ivan Flores_   ---   While working as a photojournalist in Afghanistan, I reserved a spot in my camera bag for my medical kit. When I moved back to New York, I replaced my medical kit for a Narcan kit (a common brand name for Naloxone), which I received for free as part of a training I took in preparation to cover the South Bronx.\\\\xa0  Overdoses have hit the Bronx particularly hard. If it was its own state, the Bronx would have the second-highest drug overdose rate in the country.  This winter, I was interviewing a heroin-user in a park when she pointed over my shoulder. Behind me, her friend had collapsed. His head split open on the curb, blood splattered on the pavement.\\\\xa0The woman said he might be overdosing. She told me they would get high together on occasion.\\\\xa0  The woman, one of my classmates and I ran towards the man with the Narcan in hand.\\\\xa0My classmate handed the woman a dose of Narcan. She inserted the nasal mister into her friend's nose and delivered the dose. But the man remained unconscious. I pulled on my gloves, tipped the man's head back and delivered a second dose from my kit.\\\\xa0 As first responders from the fire department arrived, the man regained consciousness.  He was taken to the hospital to recover. After about 20 more minutes, I wrapped up my interview with the woman whose friend we just witnessed overdosing. She wasn't phased by what she saw.  When I go into the field, carrying my notebook, two batteries for my camera, and a Narcan kit, I'm ready to respond again if the situation calls for it.     In this landscape, we believe journalism schools across the US should include Naloxone training in their curriculum alongside interview techniques, multimedia production, ethics and hostile-environment training for reporters headed to conflict zones.  Undergrad and graduate programmes are well-placed to teach these skills and one journalism professor has already started to do so. This winter, Jillian Bauer-Reese hosted a Naloxone training for students in her course on covering addiction at Temple University.  Bauer-Reese\\\\xa0said the training benefits journalists whether or not they encounter someone experiencing an overdose.\\\\xa0  \\\"Even if they're not going to use it,\\\" she said, \\\"they can better understand how this medication works while reporting on the opioid crisis.\\\"\\\\xa0  Other journalism professors should follow her lead, whether or not they teach reporting on addiction. Few arenas of American life remain untouched by the reach of this public health crisis. Journalists interact with a diverse array of people as part of their work and they are likely to come into contact with drug users in the field, no matter their geographical or topical beat.\\\\xa0  Are journalists and educators - those teaching the next generation of reporters - willing to step up? So far, few have. Last year, the news website Billy Penn [hosted a Naloxone training](http://kleincamp.com/2017/10/24 /narcan-training-journalists/) for a dozen journalists in Philadelphia. But in universities across the US, we have not found a single journalism programme that offers the training as part of the curriculum.  The deans of our own graduate programme have said they support the idea. Associate Dean Andrew Mendelson has already asked CUNY's legal office if it would be possible to hold the training as a workshop or part of graduate programme orientation.  \\\"The professional norms of journalism are always in flux,\\\" Mendelson said. \\\"I think the profession should be interrogating itself when new opportunities come about. What does it mean that we can carry life-saving medicine along with us when we're doing reporting?\\\"  To some, this question does not have a straightforward answer.  Some journalists believe that they have an ethical duty to remain rigidly detached from the individuals on whom they report - even in a life and death situation like an overdose. While others believe that Naloxone training is not necessary for journalists, as it will not do much to help stop the opioid epidemic in the US.  Kelly McBride, vice president at the Poynter Institute for journalism training and an expert on media ethics, for example, worries that giving Naloxone training to journalists may have a negative side effect.   Carrying medicine that can save an individual \\\"may make you more likely to focus your efforts on those individual narratives,\\\" she told us. This may cause journalists to ignore time-consuming, data-driven stories that would be more effective in holding actors accountable across government, insurance, first responders and drug companies, she added.\\\\xa0Individual accounts of addiction are powerful, McBride said, but \\\"they do very little to move the needle in the public understanding.\\\"   {articleGUID}   While McBride is right to insist on accountability journalism, we believe giving Naloxone training to journalists will improve the quality of the overall coverage of the opioid crisis. By learning how opioids affect the body and how to recognise signs of an overdose, journalists will gain practical knowledge that can't be gained from parsing a spreadsheet or interviewing an expert. This will provide them with valuable insight into the subject that they are covering.\\\\xa0  And most importantly, as more people grow addicted to opioids, the last resort for many may be the chance presence of a stranger carrying this simple medication -\\\\xa0And in some cases, that stranger can be a journalist.  The cost of this preparation is small. Keeping Naloxone kits in our bags takes no more effort than carrying the extra batteries our instructors remind us to bring with us to the field. We may never need to use the Naloxone kit as we may never need those extra batteries - but in case we do, we'll be thankful to have it.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the authors' own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"US journalism students should undergo anti-overdose training\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/journalism-students-undergo-anti-overdose-training-180315125055224.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Karachi, Pakistan-** A minor girl's rape and murder earlier this month has sent a shock wave across [Pakistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/pakistan.html).

According to Sahil, a non-government organization working on the problem of child sexual assaults, 1,764 cases of child abuse were reported in the first half of 2017 alone.  In at least 62 of such cases, children were murdered after being sexually abused. In most cases, the attacker was an acquaintance of the victim.  As chilling CCTV footage emerged showing Zainab walking hand in hand with her attacker in her final moments, public discourse shifted from protests to a call for preventive measures to protect all children from sexual abuse.  \\\"Even before the incident, I had been teaching my child about possible child abuse scenarios. I have told her to not talk to strangers and be aware of traps,\\\" said Umair Arif, father of a four-year-old, who joined the protesters in the port city of Karachi.  \\\"I have made her learn our house address and our phone number.\\\"   'Child Abuse Awareness'  As public voices grew, the government in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, announced plans to introduce \\\"Child Abuse Awareness' in its curriculum\\\".  In Pakistan, any discussion on sex, including sex education, is taboo and prompts resistance from the conservative section of the society.  The government has deliberately steered clear of talking about \\\"sex education\\\", but right-wing political groups have already warned the government against inserting \\\"obscenity\\\" in textbooks in the name of \\\"child abuse awareness\\\".  \\\"Sex abuse prevention education is a necessity of the day but there should be some checks that obscenity isn't taught in its name,\\\" Farid Piracha of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan 9s largest Islamic party, told Al Jazeera. \\\"The purpose should be propagation of ethical and religious lifestyle,\\\" he said.  The government insists it is not going for the westernisation of sexual education.  \\\"We will educate our children about what advances should they stop, obviously it won't be sex education, but it will be more about the safety measures that can be taken, sort of good touch bad touch kind of learning,\\\" Malik Ahmed Khan, the spokesperson for the Punjab government, told Al Jazeera.  The government in southern Sindh province has also come forward with a plan to implement what it calls \\\"life skills based education\\\" and \\\"child abuse awareness programme\\\" with immediate effect.  The programme which was first launched as a pilot project in collaboration with Aahung - a non-government organisation - will be made part of school curriculum all across Sindh by April 2018.   Questions and doubts  But Arif is concerned as a parent. \\\"I do not trust the education system in Pakistan,\\\" he told Al Jazeera.  While he agrees that child abuse awareness is very important, he is not comfortable with it being taught to children under 10 years of age by ill- trained teachers.  \\\"Children are innocent and my experience with my four-year-old is that if you tell her don 9t do something she might be more interested in doing it and that can make the issue worse,\\\" Arif said.  Some parents are also concerned that this might be a glorified version of sex education.  Aisha Ijaz, the programme manager at Aahung said this was not the case. \\\"I wouldn't say it is sex education. We call it life skills based education. It is tailored to the issues that we see in our society,\\\" she told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Our content was reviewed in 2012 by a group of parents, teachers and even some very progressive religious scholars went through the content and said there is nothing inappropriate about it, it should be taught to young people,\\\" Ijaz told Al Jazeera.   More than just the curriculum  Jamil believes child abuse awareness in schools is \\\"imperative\\\" but greater effort is needed to fight abuse effectively. She was one of the first to share Zainab 9s news on social media and has been working with child abuse survivors for years.  \\\"To parents and teachers, I really want to say please talk to children. The world is a frightening place. Teach them how to recognise danger. Be their safe house. Listen to them. Or they will lose their voice,\\\" she said.  Jamil hopes to see deeper understanding of the matter and a more holistic approach in educating children.  \\\"No man is born a rapist. It takes a very dead soul to rape a child,\\\" she told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Teach kindness and empathy and respect of all bodies, of all living things, of all nature. That is where the learning should begin.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Zainab's rape, murder sparks child sexual abuse debate\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/zainab-rape-murder-sparks-child-sexual-abuse-debate-180120122356487.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Described as one of the greatest Japanese geochemists and hailed as an \\\"iron scientist\\\", Katsuko Saruhashi would have been 98 years old on March 22.

He also studied in Spain and Germany.\\\\xa0   *  \\\\xa0Penfield believed studying medicine was **\\\"the best way to make the world a better place.\\\"**    *  In 1917 he married Helen Kermott, who shared his altruism and love of helping others. Wilder and Helen\\\\xa0had four children.\\\\xa0One of his daughters also founded a children's care centre.\\\\xa0    * After taking a surgical apprenticeship, he obtained a position at the Neurological Institute of New York, where he carried out **his first solo operation to treat epilepsy**.\\\\xa0   *  In 1928, Penfield accepted an invitation to move to\\\\xa0Montreal, Quebec. There, Penfield taught at\\\\xa0McGill University\\\\xa0and the\\\\xa0Royal Victoria Hospital, becoming **Montreal's first neurosurgeon**.     *  In 1934, he became a Canadian citizen after he and Dr William Cone founded the **Montreal Neurological Institute**.\\\\xa0    *  In 1935, he published three case studies describing the psychological effects of frontal lobe surgery.    * He used his experience treating his sister to explain the link between brain and behaviour. He said: \\\"If she were alive, I am sure she would approve of such an analysis in the hope it would help others.\\\"   *  He kept his family close throughout his career, writing the book Man and His Family, which stressed the need to nurture and encourage positive family life.    >  > > A fitting image!

Working with his friend and colleague, Herber Jasper, they developed what was known as the **Montreal Procedure**.\\\\xa0     *  **Mapping responses.** As part of the procedure, the surgeon removes part of the skull and uses electrodes to stimulate the brain while the person is conscious with the intention of targeting the areas responsible for epilepsy.     *  The doctor **mapped the responses in different parts of the brain.**     *  Through this method, Penfield was able to map the brain's sensory and motor cortices and show their connection throughout the body.\\\\xa0     *  **His first map was published in 1937** , and a revised version was published in 1950. Those maps are still used today, nearly unaltered.\\\\xa0     *  Penfield's contributions to modern neuroscience raised Canada's status in healthcare, science, and discovery while his innovations gave people with epilepsy better lives.    >  > > \\\\U0001f525\\\\U0001f35e  >  > Wilder Penfield and the greatest Heritage Minute of all time.

I'm worried my message is almost mainstream, that I sound like I'm part of the choir. I bet nearly every politician and industry leader I meet in Davos this week will talk the talk about the evils of inequality and be very eloquent and believable, too.  I mean, how could they not? The evidence is overwhelming. Surely, no stable genius attending Davos could possibly try to deny, minimise or justify 2018 levels of global inequality? Now that would be a controversial sideshow!  [Oxfam's report this year](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/world- richest-82-percent-global-wealth-oxfam-180122080920014.html) is as much about people's stories as it is about inequality's staggering statistics. These are the people around the world losing their lands and livelihoods as fast as ever. People forced to work for peanuts in ever-more exploitative and abusive jobs, like the women in US factory lines who have to wear nappies because aren't allowed toilet breaks.\\\\xa0  Millions of children still denied schooling and poor people denied affordable healthcare. Stories of discrimination and exploitation, of activists and unions silenced, and of profits flowing as rivers of money into off-shore tax havens. All this and more to prop up a man-made system where another billionaire is created every other day because the top 1 percent are pocketing more than 80 percent of the wealth our world creates. The bottom half of humanity gets none of this new wealth at all.  > The unspoken contract between the elites and the 99 percent that unfettered market globalisation and liberalisation should benefit us all is broken.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   Today's economy is designed near-perfectly to reward wealth ahead of work. This is Oxfam's story at Davos. And we're not even seriously attacked any more for saying it.  It's as if inequality apologists can barely be bothered because - and this\\\\xa0does\\\\xa0worry me - they don't feel their cosy system is threatened enough that they need to.\\\\xa0  So this year, more than ever, I am wondering who really holds the answers here. Are some of us waiting for science to come up with some new technology that will magically solve the problem, as I suspect many people are anxiously hoping for a discovery that will stop [climate change](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/climate-change.html)? Are we waiting for the enfranchised masses to vote for \\\"change\\\", for the next radical option presented to them? For a revolution?  Or do we think that corporate and political leaders will finally be moved towards enlightened collective interest all of a sudden?  I'm afraid the answer to the last one is that, beyond some notable exceptions, there is no appeal for capitalist elites to be\\\\xa0nice _._ \\\\xa0Business ethics are either imposed by regulation or else they exist off-balance-sheet, maybe on a voluntary basis - something that companies can pick up and pay lip service to when necessary.  Instead, we need to look to the business trailblazers like those leading innovative models based upon equity - worker-owned companies such as the multibillion-dollar Mondragon in Spain and Amul in India, for example.  Or those willing to consider a visionary idea. We are putting the case to business leaders that they should not pay a penny in shareholder dividends and executive bonuses until all their workers are getting a living wage and their producers a fair price.\\\\xa0  We do not have the patience to wait or hope. We need to look to the law. And new laws must be pushed into existence by the collective power of people.  We will only close the gap between men and women's pay by legislating it closed. At the speed we're going now, it will take 217 years. Iceland has caught on.  We need to throw the book at irresponsible corporate tax behaviour which alone costs poor countries $100bn a year. That book needs to hit the corporate lobbyists while we're at it.  We need to be less worried about disruptive new technologies, but more proactive in understanding and harnessing them properly. The utility of every invention depends on how it is owned and controlled for the public good.  Law has the power to ensure that nobody should work on a level of pay that they cannot live a decent life.\\\\xa0  This means governments getting back into the driving seat. In days gone by, governments would value the masses because they needed them for their factories and armies, and so they would feed, educate and keep them healthy. That's changed today.\\\\xa0  Then we were sold the idea that trade-fuelled growth would spread around the world, carried by democracy, on a rising tide that would \\\"lift up all boats\\\". That's failed, too.  The unspoken contract between the elites and the 99 percent that unfettered market globalisation and liberalisation should benefit us all is broken.  Globalisation has lifted many people out of the most abject poverty and we celebrate that. But it has been even more successful in boosting an elite few into superyachts stuffed with stupendous wealth, while dumping hundreds of millions of people onto the flotsam and jetsam at the bottom.  We are beginning to be left to trust that those at the top will rescue those below.  But the worst-case scenario is - they won't. There will be no value in it. The masses will be left adrift to fend for themselves.  It's up to us all to make sure that doesn't come to pass.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How can we bridge the widening global inequality gap?\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/bridge-widening-global-inequality-gap-180123085415512.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Recent anti-government demonstrations in Iran exposed the growing divide between rich and poor.

Rwanda was the first country in the world to have more than half of its government run by women.  Currently, 64 percent of its parliament is female, and it has been ranked the highest country in the world with most women in parliament, as of January 2017.  Jessica Horn, director of programmes, African Women's Development Fund in [Ghana](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ghana.html), says: \\\"There is a legacy of African women playing significant roles in political leadership, and so it should not be too much of a surprise to see women playing political roles in Rwanda.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/50848420d5ad44eb989dc7bcb9146048_18.jpg)  ---  Memory Pamella Kadau:\\\\xa0Rwanda sets an example for Africa and the world in terms of women's political participation process     \\\"It's the number that is significant - and that is the result of mobilising.  \\\"African feminists have always argued, though, that it is not just quantity - the number of women in parliament - but politics: whether they work for a women's rights and transformative agenda.\\\"  Horn says, \\\"On that point, every African parliament needs work.

It was the beginning of the six-year-long First Intifada.  After two decades of illegal Israeli occupation in the [Gaza Strip](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/gaza.html) and West Bank, Palestinians of all generations and political parties worked together in astounding unity as one force, demanding Palestine's liberation.  With their non-violent tactics, such as protests, general strikes, and a boycott of Israeli products, the First Intifada became a model for grassroots resistance.  \\\"We were expecting that this intifada would bring a state for us Palestinians. [The movement] was that strong. It's not like these days,\\\" said Naila Ayyash, who was in her mid-20s when the intifada broke out.  \\\"At that time, political parties were very strong, especially the women's movement inside the parties.\\\"  According to Rula Salameh, who was a freshman at Ramallah's Birzeit University when the intifada began, there wasn't a single student who hadn't joined a political party on campus. All students spent their time and energy helping their community and working towards the collective mission of liberating [Palestine](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Palestine.html) from Israeli occupation.  Salameh recalled sleeping in tents for three nights in a village near Tulkarm with 150 university students; the student council arranged the trip so they could help a Palestinian family collect olives on their land.  Since an Israeli military area and a settlement were located near their land, soldiers would typically prevent the family from reaching their lands during olive harvest season, Salameh explained.  \\\"This was the first time that [the family] managed to collect all the olives without being attacked by soldiers,\\\" Salameh said.  \\\"Compared with the situation today, it's totally different. Voluntary work was really a part of our life, part of what we were educated to do. Everyone felt that they were doing something positive for their community. We weren't wasting our energy.\\\"  While the student movement served as an engine that helped propel the First Intifada, today's youth face drastically different dynamics.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/11/8571f94741514555bd9829c22c41b64f_18.jpg)  ---  Rula Salameh [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera]         **New obstacles**  Following US President [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people /donald-trump.html)'s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's [capital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-jerusalem-decision- latest-updates-171212081649751.html) in early December, both [Fatah](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/fatah.html) and Hamas called for a new intifada, but only some 3,000 protesters showed up, compared with tens of thousands of Palestinians on the streets during the First Intifada.   {articleGUID}   Omar Kiswani, president of the student council at Birzeit University, told Al Jazeera the Palestinian Authority (PA) is the biggest obstacle for politically active youth today; students are regularly arrested and imprisoned for their political affiliations on campus.  The PA, formed under the [1993 Oslo accords\\\\xa0](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/10/killed-oslo- accords-151001072411049.html)that officially ended the intifada, has long been criticised as an obstacle to Palestinian resistance because of its security collaboration, as a quisling authority, with [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html).  Kiswani was arrested as he prepared his candidacy in student elections. He spent a year in Israeli prisons for his participation in a [Hamas](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/Hamas.html)-affiliated group on campus.  \\\"They say that our work is illegal,\\\" Kiswani said. \\\"We get arrested regularly. Students from all parties get arrested, but Hamas students are arrested more. We're getting used to it.\\\"  In the past year, two presidents of the student union were arrested, as well as other members, said Kiswani.   **PA-Israeli collaboration**  Birzeit student Yahya Rabee, 21, was arrested at 2am by PA forces who raided his home. They detained him for three days before handing him over to Israeli forces. He was imprisoned in Israel for eight months, enduring physical abuse.  In his jail cell, he found seven friends from Birzeit also imprisoned for being part of the Hamas-affiliated group. All the young members of his family have been imprisoned for the same reason.  According to Birzeit's Right to Education campaign, since [Trump's Jerusalem declaration](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-defies-warnings- reckless-jerusalem-decision-171206160643273.html), there has been an increase in student arrests. Currently, there are more than 60 Birzeit students imprisoned in Israeli jails, detentions that are illegal under international law.   {articleGUID}   Since 2004, more than 800 Birzeit students have been arrested. Some have been sentenced to more than one life sentence.  \\\"Israel tries to destroy [the youth] by arresting them, imprisoning them and by attacking, especially, the student council,\\\" said Sondos Hamad, coordinator of the Right to Education campaign.  \\\"The Israeli occupation feels threatened by student leaders, by members of the student council, by those who are our hope to change the status quo.\\\"  About 40 percent of Palestine's male population has been imprisoned by Israel since 1967.  Any Palestinian who has shown strong potential as a leader has either been imprisoned or assassinated.  \\\"We believe and hope that every Palestinian in prison will be freed,\\\" Rabee said. \\\"They're the ones who are able to lead Palestinians, not the PA. Some of them are doctors, professors; they have [the capacity] to lead.\\\"  Rabee and Ayyash both pointed out the Palestinians' financial dependency on the PA as a factor for some to avoid civil disobedience.  \\\"Some people just care about their money and how they live. They're afraid of the PA and of being imprisoned,\\\" Rabee said.

This is very bad. This is Palestinian land. Why divide it like this?\\\"  Division and isolation is what Palestinians living in the besieged Gaza Strip have been struggling with for the past decade.  Besieged by Israel and [Egypt](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Egypt.html), the UN has repeatedly warned of a humanitarian crisis unfolding.  Al-Azhar University student Randa Harara, 21, often attends non-violent demonstrations, and said they do make a difference in letting the world know about the suffering in Gaza.  Last December, an Israeli sniper shot her in the thigh while she was protesting near Gaza's eastern border. Harara had just finished giving a TV interview when she was shot, standing 300 metres away from the fence. Despite her painful injury, she is adamant about rejoining the demonstrations as soon as she recovers.  \\\"This is our duty towards Jerusalem. As a Palestinian from Gaza, this is the least that I can do for my nation to fight against [oppression] \\\\u2026 As long as we're besieged, it's normal that we keep protesting against it.\\\"  However, because of Gaza's isolation, it's difficult for protests to pick up momentum, as was the case with the First Intifada. For a population of two million, the number of people who join the demonstrations every Friday is low, Harara explained.  \\\"There's a distance between us and Jerusalem. If we [weren't under siege], we could do more.  \\\"There has to be a better way to organise the movement. We have to express our anger and frustration in any way that we can, because it's a big issue. There should be more people going to the streets, attending demonstrations. It's for the Palestinian cause. If we, the youth, don't move, then who will?\\\"   **Social stigma**  Ayyash said during the First Intifada the majority of demonstrators were women. However, today, in Gaza, it is rare to see women participating in protests.  Many told Harara that, as a woman, it's better for her to stay at home or to focus on her education.   {articleGUID}   \\\"I believe in what I'm doing. What people say about me is meaningless, as I'm sure I'm not doing anything wrong,\\\" Harara said.  \\\"I think that if other women weren't facing social stigmatisation, which prevents them from attending demonstrations, there would be many more people willing to express their frustrations through demonstrations.\\\"  Ayyash and Salameh agree the role of Palestinian political parties has diminished since the Oslo Accords.  The new generation has the energy and willpower, but no one is guiding them in the right direction, Salameh said.  \\\"This is what I hear all the time [from the youth]: 'We don't know what to do,'\\\" explained Salameh.  \\\"[Political parties] aren't interested in working with the young generation and explaining to them the power that they have and how they should use it \\\\u2026 We're not giving them a chance to replace [the old generation.]\\\"  The key to success is unity, said Ayyash. The split between Fatah and Hamas has continued for 11 years and without unity, no goal can be achieved.  \\\"Before, we were united [during the First Intifada],\\\" Ayyash said. \\\"There is a gap between the [political] leaders and the people, and Israel is playing with it.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/11/0c47569e226a4b0cb2ef962d113290d9_18.jpg)  ---  Naila Ayyash [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera]    ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"What happened to Palestine's youth-led struggle?\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/happened-palestine-youth-led-struggle-180211154056240.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ More than 1,600 people have gathered in the Rwandan capital of Kigali for the second edition of the Next Einstein Forum (NEF), a three-day science and technology event.

Since 2000, the country has experienced remarkable economic growth, with gross domestic product (GDP) rising from $1.7bn in 2000 to $8.4bn in 2016 and the number of students, teachers and schools rising rapidly as well.  However, Rwanda can be considered to be an outlier; today, only two percent of total global scientific research output comes from African countries.  NEF's goal is to increase that number significantly in the coming years and decades.  To do so, the organisation, which was founded in collaboration with the African Institute for Mathematics and Science (AIMS), offers fellowships for researchers, grants for promising technologies and support for local and regional projects that increase Africa's footprint in the scientific field.  This year's main topic was connecting science to humanity, and the majority of the panels and discussions focused on subjects like healthcare, the future of education and closing the gender gap.   **The agenda**  Discussions ranged from how to how to change the mindset of young children so that they aspire to become scientists, to how technologies like blockchain might improve the quality of life in [Africa](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html).  The event also saw [the launch](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03 /scientific-african-launched-increase-research-output-180327054503108.html) of Africa's first scientific journal, the Scientific African.  During the Challenge of Invention to Innovation (ci2i) competition, researchers from across Africa were invited to pitch inventions addressing health challenges and climate change.  It was during this ceremony, at the end of the three-day event, that the event's topics of health, education and the gender gap all came together.  One of the winners, Rachel Sibande from Malawi, who pitched a system that used maize husks as biofuel to generate electricity, dedicated her prize to all women in Africa.  \\\"This is for all the women and girls of Africa that are working to innovate and change the world,\\\" Sibande said.

Haro grew up during the Mexican Revolution and while he was a recognised astronomer, he didn't always want to be one. He studied philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and intended to go into law, but later his path changed.  This is his story:   Mexican Revolution\\\\xa0    *  Guillermo Haro was born on March 21, 1913. Growing up during the Mexican Revolution and concerned over his country and the changes that were taking place, he decided to study philosophy.    * However, during his time as a student, he met Luis Enrique Eroz, a Mexican astronomer and politician who encouraged him to change his path.\\\\xa0Haro started working as Eroz's assistant at the Tonantzintla Observatory.   *  Between 1943 and 1947, he went on to train at observatories in the US, including the Harvard College Observatory and the Case Institute of Technology, embarking upon a career in astronomy.    *  \\\"He was a passionate man ... and he had character and decisiveness. He went to Harvard ... and convinced the director of Harvard University,\\\" Julieta Fierro, a Mexican astronomer, explained.\\\\xa0         ---  \\\\xa0      Astronomy    *  Later, Haro returned to his natal land, and in 1945 started working in Tonantzintla again.    *  During this time, he met his wife, the pre-eminent Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska. She said she was drawn to his intellect.\\\\xa0    *  In interviews, she narrated how, in his childhood, Haro discovered, thanks to his mother, on a trip to Cuautla, that behind the mountains there were other mountains, and that behind them, others. He realised the world didn't end in those mountains. According to Poniatowska, this was fundamental in his decision to follow the path of astronomy.\\\\xa0    * \\\"Before Guillermo Haro, astronomy was in a stagnant state in Mexico,\\\" Arcadio Poveda, a Mexican astronomer told local media.\\\\xa0   > Before Guillermo Haro, astronomy was in a stagnant state in Mexico. > > Arcadio Poveda\\\\xa0 > >   Red and blue stars\\\\xa0    *  Among his biggest contributions was the discovery of a type of planetary nebulae named Herbig-Haro objects.    *  He also discovered flare stars - red and blue blight stars - in the region of the Orion constellation.\\\\xa0    * Haro listed 8,746 blue stars. In 1956, he listed 44 blue galaxies, and discovered T Tauri stars, a supernova, more than 10 novae and a comet.   *  \\\"Haro did not lower his guard, he always wanted to do more, he wanted to go further, he wanted the country to be transformed,\\\" Manuel Peimbert, one of his students, told local media.\\\\xa0    *  These contributions led to Haro becoming the first Mexican elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1959, alerting the rest of the world to the emergence of serious astronomy in Mexico.    * He was one of the founders of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and served as its first president in 1960.

So I sat down with some of my friends who are older than me, have already graduated or studied computer science and I started to learn how to run computer programs and software with them.  It was tough at the beginning, very complicated, but computer science has always been my obsession. After training with my friends, I completed my high school exam and did quite well.  Before the campaign started [against Eastern Ghouta], I was going to an internet shop to study, which cost a lot - nearly $3 per session every day. The books that I had to print cost me a fortune. I earn only $150 a month and printing a book costs about $30.\\\\xa0       ---  **WATCH:** [UN expects Eastern Ghouta civilian evacuations (1:50)\\\\xa0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0YHODACVJ4)    Studying on my laptop was challenging too.

Sadly, I had to withdraw since I can't complete the courses under these circumstances.  Our days now are horrifying; I just can't describe it.

For sure, studying in Ghouta is very different. We had class interrupted countless times because of the relentless shelling campaign these last years, especially in Jobar area, close to me.  In each of these shelling campaigns, medical checkpoints and hospitals have been drowning with patients.

[The university charges an assessment fee of $100 per course.]  Before studying at the virtual university, I studied computer science for two years in Eastern Ghouta, which was supported by the temporary government of the opposition, but my certificate wasn't recognised by international universities because the university didn't belong to the regime.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/3/17/ee42a695caf54e7b91a189765acd4e3c_18.jpg)  ---  Mohammed Nizar Arbash says 'the virtual option has been the best solution' for obtaining an education in Eastern Ghouta [Courtesy of Mohammed Nizar Arbash]\\\\xa0     The certificate that I received was practically useless and I had to start from scratch all over again.

Those of us who are visible as an \\\"other\\\" - having black or brown skin, bearing names that show we are Muslim or Hispanic, wearing clothing that mark us as somehow \\\"different\\\" - are repetitively evoked (in both veiled and vulgar language) in the president's public speeches, private policy meetings, and barrages of tweets.  Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/952530515894169601)\\\\xa0earlier this month that he plans to make immigration more \\\"merit-based\\\" to attract \\\"highly skilled\\\" workers and followed these plans up by calling potential and existing immigrants from Haiti and all of Africa, in particular, people from \\\"shithole countries\\\" during a policy meeting.\\\\xa0  Part of why Americans are susceptible to this violent, xenophobic, and nativist rhetoric is not because they are exceptionally thick, but because of how the national mythology of the US\\\\xa0 - one constructed on Puritan ideals of egalitarianism, \\\"hard work\\\" and perseverance against adversity - is constructed.  Americans are told, since childhood, that hard work and perseverance not only build character, but allow them to overcome obstacles, and achieve their goals and dreams. Because this powerful myth is repetitively drummed into their heads - be it through apocryphal narratives of kids who came from impoverished backgrounds who went on to become multimillion-dollar earning athletes, or women who beat the odds and attained positions of leadership in fields dominated by men - they learn to believe that their country is a meritocracy.  > These experiences of failure and not-making-it are true, unexceptional, and the norm; yet, they are unincorporated into America's popular narrative.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   Anyone who has gone thorough the immigration process here knows that US immigration is not only class-based, but underhandedly racist, too: after all, Trump himself remarked, in that same infamous policy meeting, that immigrants from Asia should be favoured over those from Haiti and Africa.  So it baffles me why legislators and pundits are suddenly calling on immigration reforms to reflect the desire for skilled workers, when it is clear, from even a cursory glance at H1B and Greencard application documents, that it is already so.  As an immigrant who was born in a small island in South Asia (Sri Lanka) and grew up in a Southern African country (Zambia), and who now lives and teaches in the US, I make a point of incorporating my own narrative of immigration - the cost, the paperwork, the lawyers' fees, the networks of fellow immigrants who helped me, and the (often difficult to identify) factors and existing privileges in my personal history that allowed me to be a \\\"successful\\\" immigrant - into how I teach my global literature classes.   {articleGUID}   \\\"It's about money and existing privilege,\\\" I laugh. \\\"America sure didn't want any tired and poor immigrants.\\\" Most of my American students are surprised - unless they, too, have come from recent-immigrant families.\\\\xa0  We all know this to be true, if we are recent immigrants to the US. But we become defensive against racism, and prefer to align ourselves with American rhetoric of being exceptional. And because US immigration policy already selects immigrants who come from privileged social class, caste, and educational backgrounds, this group is used to being seen as elite; certainly, these immigrants do not want to align themselves with workers in the service industries or the undocumented.\\\\xa0  I was dismayed, but not surprised, therefore, by the defensive rhetoric used by my fellow immigrants when \\\"Shithole-gate\\\" hit the national and international fans. On Twitter and Facebook, immigrants brought out the weaponry of respectability to prove that racists were wrong about them. Since Haiti and Africa were on the \\\"shithole\\\" list this time, they listed the exceptional African and Haitian immigrants who invented amazing things and discovered incredible surgical techniques that no doubt saved the lives of countless American racists who hated immigrants.  Others touted how so few immigrants, statistically, are involved in any crimes. Articles, like this one in the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-global-african-immigrants- explainer-20180112-story.html), rushed to assure frightened Americans that while many are refugees, and \\\"beneficiaries of the 'diversity visa programme' aimed at boosting immigration from underrepresented nations\\\\u2026African immigrants **** are better educated than people born in the US or the immigrant population as a whole\\\".  The African Studies Association's Board of Directors released the following [statement](http://www.africanstudies.org/news/967-statement-by-the-asa-board- of-directors-regarding-president-trump-s-remarks):  \\\"[In the] US Census Bureau report, Africans account for only 4 percent of the total foreign-born population in the United States, but the educational attainment of that 4 percent far exceeds the average of all of those born outside of the US.\\\\xa0Indeed, 41 percent of African residents in the US hold bachelor's degrees or higher. Nigerians, who have been singled out by the president on previous occasions, are among the most educated group in the US, with some 61 percent holding bachelor's degrees and 17 percent masters degrees.\\\"  All this is true. But this rhetoric only serves to boost the myth of merit, and further the erroneous belief that only the \\\"deserving\\\" and exceptional - who are mostly exceptional because of existing class, family, political, and educational privileges - should be in the US.  As critic\\\\xa0Steven Salaita\\\\xa0explained in a Facebook post, cases like that of 57-year-old Palestinian-American business owner, [Amer Othman Adi](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/01/youngstown_businessman_facing_deportation_is_expected_to_be_released.html)\\\\xa0-\\\\xa0who has been unjustly held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is currently on hunger strike,\\\\xa0\\\"gives lie to the conservative (and often liberal) narrative that 'good' immigrants are welcome \\\\u2026 By all accounts, including those of a mayor, a business community, and a congressman, Adi was the ideal arrivant. So, even by the insidious standards of model minority discourse (fuelled by anti-Black racism and Native dispossession), Adi isn't worthy of freedom and dignity. What is left to conclude? That people from certain countries - shitholes - are never acceptable no matter how much they conform to the state's chauvinistic mythologies.\\\"  > It is time that Asian immigrants in particular ... also stop imagining themselves as more special and deserving than US minorities of non-recent immigrant backgrounds.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   In my university classes, I make sure that I stress that all but the most privileged had to almost bend God's will to be here, and stay here. I make sure that I include immigrants who are both documented and undocumented in this narrative.\\\\xa0  We are nearly all exceptional in many ways, but not because we have class privilege and exceptional jobs - but because of the inventiveness of our hustle, the \\\"I can't go on/I'll go on\\\" ideology, evocative of Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's beautiful, painful writing.  We internalise that struggle, steel, and vulnerability in the face of immigration officials at airports, border checkpoints, local immigration offices, and the everyday racism we encounter. When I read French existentialists, I actually laugh: if they actually wanted to know what it is like to face insurmountable obstacles, they should have first spoken to a black or brown immigrant in the US (or France) first.\\\\xa0  It is true that many of the first friends I made in the US were in college because they did have something exceptional about them that parents and teachers recognised; a slew of people - school administrators, guidance counsellors, a friend in the neighbourhood who had an aunt who went to college - helped get them into university by helping them fill out paperwork, write entrance essays, and generally navigate the difficult US tertiary education system and immigrate into the lower rungs of the US middle class.\\\\xa0  But I also pose this question: what happens if you are exceptional, but a queue of terrible and overworked educators dismiss or simply do not see your ability? What happens if you are not exceptional, but simply ordinary, and poor, and immigrant?  While the ordinary middle and upper-middle class kid will often have parents and educators advocating for them - protecting the young person from learning difficult lessons even at the cost of their character and skills development - the poor and the immigrant in the US rarely have the benefits of that invisible, protective shield.\\\\xa0These experiences of failure and not-making- it are true, unexceptional, and the norm; yet, they are unincorporated into the US's popular narrative.   {articleGUID}   Those who have gone through this expensive and Faustian processes of an H1-B application, Permanent Residency or \\\"Greencard\\\" process, and eventually, US citizenship, know how ludicrously and nakedly class-based, racist, and violent it is towards immigrants. It is especially so for women of colour.  This system clearly favours those with existing economic, class, gender, and privileges that pipeline them into college educations. Those of us from urban centres, rather than rural areas, from nations with thriving education systems, from families with existing wealth and political power, and those from ethnic groups that are in ascendancy get ahead.\\\\xa0  US visas and immigration processes favour those with money in hand, to pay for those exorbitant application fees, a requirement at every step of the immigration and naturalisation process. Yet, if I suggest that the US is not a meritocracy, my students react in disbelief, and many sweetly try to convince me otherwise, using the examples of the miraculous achievements of the authors we read in class.  When I point out that the problem with a meritocracy is that only those who are truly exceptional - like the authors we read - who will \\\"make it\\\" out of dire circumstances, there is silence. When I point out that none of us would have a chance, should we have been born in more dire circumstances, since no one in class (including me) is truly as exceptional as any of the authors we read, there is more silence.  These are some of the few moments in which I have felt that I have communicated something of importance about how structures in the US work - creating at least some doubt about powerful and pervasive mythologies that serve only to blame those who cannot claw their way out of circumstances meant to make them fail.   {articleGUID}   \\\\xa0The truth is, anyone who plots, schemes, saves, and works to the point of exhaustion - sometimes only with the hope that the next or even the third generation will benefit - in an economically and politically powerful nation like the US has to be exceptional, in some way.  It is obvious that (white) Americans need to be disabused of the notion that the US's white population is special, and deserving, somehow, of privilege; it is time to get over the belief that they only received their privileges from having worked for it.  But just as importantly, those immigrants of more privileged backgrounds - those who are currently touting the percentage of people from their national group who have college and post-graduate degrees, as if waving these statistics and their material possessions are ways of proving that they are not, in fact, deserving of Trump's racism - also need an antidote for their misplaced smugness.  It is time that Asian immigrants in particular - who benefit from the Civil Rights Movement and the efforts of African Americans towards changing and challenging racist immigration laws that excluded Asians, and who have, as a group, been favoured since American immigration began moving towards a merit- based system - also stop imagining themselves as more special and deserving than US minorities of non-recent immigrant backgrounds.\\\\xa0  Our class snobbery, carried over from our old countries, and defensive superiority, developed against the racism of our new country, has only aided white supremacists who couldn't care less about how exceptional we are.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"The very American myth of 'exceptional immigrants'\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/american-myth-exceptional-immigrants-180119124728058.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ In [Kenya](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kenya.html), teachers are getting a new curriculum for the first time in 32 years.

He will be greatly missed,\\\" she said on Twitter.  The record-breaking run was on the Oxford University track during a local athletics meeting, with only a few spectators witnessing the Englishman 9s destruction of the myth that no human being could run so fast.  Bannister made headlines around the world at the age of 25. His achievement opened the physical and psychological door for many other milers, who have since beaten his time of three minutes 59.4 seconds.  Roger Gilbert Bannister, born in Harrow, a London suburb, on March 23, 1929, was a shy, gangling medical student who preferred to be an oarsman rather than a runner.  In 1946, when he went to Oxford, his great ambition was to row against Cambridge in the annual boat race on the Thames.  But Bannister, who stood 1.8 meters tall and weighed only 68 kilograms, was told he was too light to make a first-rate oarsman.  So he turned to running and his new ambition became to win the 1,500 meters at the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952.  Bannister started a five-year build-up, and, in 1947, at the age of 17, ran his first mile race at Oxford, finishing second in a time of just over five minutes. Later that year, he won the mile for Oxford against Cambridge in an athletics meeting.  >  > > All at British Athletics are incredibly saddened by the passing of Sir Roger Bannister at the age of 88.  >  > A legend in every sense of the word.

But he managed only fourth place in the Helsinki Games 1,500 meters final.  The press criticized him for faulty training methods. Bannister, nicknamed the \\\"lone wolf miler\\\" because he scorned coaches, had worked out his own training schedule to fit in with his studies.  After Helsinki, he became the forgotten man of athletics. But he had set his sights on the four-minute-mile - a challenge which had fascinated athletes and enthusiasts for years.  The world record was gradually being whittled down and a number of athletes were considered capable of crashing the four-minute barrier.  Australia 9s great miler, John Landy, recorded a four minutes 2.1 seconds mile in December 1952, and Bannister cut this to four minutes two seconds in June 1953.  With American Wes Santee trying to lower his [US](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html) record of four minutes 2.4 seconds, the pressure was on and four-minute-mile fever was mounting. To Bannister, the challenge was not only to break the barrier but to be the first man to do so.  The Oxford University versus Amateur Athletics Association fixture of May 6 was the first competition of the British season of 1954. Bannister, by then a medical student at a London hospital, set that day for his attempt.  He enlisted the aid of his training companions and friends, Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher, top athletes in their own right, as pacemakers.   Setting the record  May 6 was cold, wet and windy - not ideal for a record-breaking attempt. Bannister thought of calling it off, but, after a short rain shower and with a drop in the wind, he said: \\\"Right, I 9ll try.\\\"  After a false start by pacemaker Brasher, the field of six got away. Bannister urged Brasher to go faster and at the halfway mark called on Chataway to take over from the tiring Brasher.  Then, 210 meters from the tape, he pulled out from behind Chataway to immortalize himself as the first sub-four-minute miler.  Seven weeks later, Landy beat Bannister 9s record, with a mile in three minutes 57.9 seconds, and, in August, Bannister lowered his own time to three minutes 58.8 seconds, beating Landy at the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, [Canada](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Canada.html).   Medical career  In August 1954, Bannister captured the European 1500 meters crown. Having qualified as a doctor, he retired from active athletics at the end of 1954 to pursue his medical career.  By 1963, he was established in his profession as a consultant in nervous diseases at three hospitals, and, a year later, he became a member of Britain 9s Advisory Sports Council.  In 1971, aged 42 and a father of four, he was appointed by the government as the first chairman of the Executive Sports Council designed to finance and promote British sport.  He was awarded a knighthood in 1975. He became president of the World Sports Council in 1976 and in 1977 was the first Briton to win West Germany 9s Hans-Heinrich Siegbert prize for his services to sport.  Oxford University elected him Master (head) of its Pembroke College in 1985.  Bannister gave up his medical practice after a serious car accident and devoted himself to research. He became director of the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London and edited a textbook on nervous system disorders.  His prediction that the mile record would be progressively lowered was born out in subsequent years. In 1999, Moroccan Hiram El Guerrouj became the 13th record holder since Bannister, lowering the time to 3:43.13.   Bannister quotes  On the allure of the four-minute mile:  \\\"It was a target. University athletes had been trying for years and it just didn 9t seem to be capable of being broken. There was a magic about four symmetrical laps of one minute each. It was just something that caught the public 9s imagination.  \\\"Even then people were talking about whether it would ever be possible for someone to run a mile in four minutes ... There was no logic in my mind that if you can run a mile in four minutes, 1.25, you can 9t run it in 3:59 ... I knew enough medicine and physiology to know it wasn 9t a physical barrier, but I think it had become a psychological barrier.\\\"  On his drive to be the first to break the four-minute barrier:  \\\"It stood there as something that was waiting to be done, and I was in the right place at the right time and was ready to do it. My attitude was that it can be done, and it will be done soon, and I 9d rather it were done here.  \\\"I thought it would be right for Britain to try to get this. There was a feeling of patriotism. Our new queen had been crowned the year before, Everest had been climbed in 1953. Although I tried in 1953, I broke the British record, but not the four-minute mile, and so everything was ready in 1954.\\\"  On the bad weather on the day of his attempt and his uncertainty over whether to run:  \\\"I was using a flag on a neighboring church, a St. George 9s flag. I noticed it fluttering and I used that as a measure of the strength of the wind. And I felt that just 20 minutes before, it was not fluttering as strongly. ... I calculated there 9s a 50-50 chance of my doing it. I said, 8If there 9s a 50-50 chance and I don 9t take it, I may never get another chance to beat (John) Landy to it. 9 So I said, 8Let 9s do it. 9\\\"  On the size of the crowd at Oxford 9s Iffley Road track on the day of his run:  \\\"If the number of people who have come up to me saying they were there, they would have fit into Wembley Stadium. Matter of fact, there weren 9t more than 1,500. I hadn 9t advertised the fact. Word got out that I might break the four-minute mile, but I didn 9t want to be rail-roaded to being committed to running it if the conditions were absolutely hopeless.\\\"  On the race:  \\\"Chris Brasher was leading. He was a steeplechaser. I settled back. First lap, 58 seconds, and then as one hoped, he took us through the half-mile in 1:58. Then during the lap in which Chris Chataway took over, inevitably he was tiring. Three quarters, I heard was three minutes, 1 second. I knew I had to do the last lap in 59. At 300 meters, I overtook him. I then went flat out for the finishing line and just about managed to stagger over it, all in. I couldn 9t stand at the end. I had always been able to take more out of myself than there was in the final sprint and I did on that occasion.\\\"  On the announcement of his time by Norris McWhirter:  \\\"He had carefully rehearsed. He announced: 8The result of event No. 8, one mile, was R.G. Bannister, of Merton and Exeter Colleges, in a time which subject to ratification, is a new track record, a new British all-comers record, a new European record, a new Commonwealth Empire record, a new world record in three ... 9 That was when the crowd exploded and we didn 9t hear any more. It didn 9t matter what the rest was.\\\"  On his showdown against John Landy at the Empire Games in Vancouver, British Columbia:  \\\"I knew that more important than the four-minute mile, from the point of view of my career, was whether I could or could not defeat John Landy. The Empire Games in Vancouver were the important settling of the score. If I didn 9t manage to defeat John Landy there, he would be the world record holder and have the right to be the best miler in the world.\\\"  \\\"He went into the lead. The first half-mile was just on two minutes. At three- quarters he seemed to be getting away from me and there was a gap of about 12 yards at one point. But I managed to close the gap during the third lap, and then on the last bend he looked over his left shoulder and I chose that moment to overtake him and we managed to finish in that order: Bannister one and Landy two, by about four yards.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Roger Bannister dies, the 'lone wolf miler'\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/roger-bannister-dies-lone-wolf-miler-180304180538260.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 in part for \\\"striving\\\" to attain \\\"ethnic conciliation by peaceful means\\\".

She describes every little detail about this place - the water spring, the lavish trees and the flowers that bloom throughout the year. She tells us about the beautiful old stone houses, the fig trees and the cactus plants.  Imwas is a village situated southeast of the town of Ramleh, where my grandfather owned a plot of land. After my grandfather passed, my father inherited the land. One day, my nine siblings and I will inherit this land from our father. We'll build our home there, and we'll harvest the crops of our field.  But for now, we live in a small apartment in the Qalandia refugee camp, east of [Jerusalem](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/jerusalem.html). My family has lived there since the Israeli army forced my grandfather from his land in Imwas in 1967. We live in the overcrowded camp, thinking that this is temporary, like the rest of the camp's residents, many of whom were forced from their lands in 1948, when Israel was created.  We keep telling ourselves that this is all temporary, and we believe it. The faith we inherited from our ancestors is strong and deep - we believe that it is possible for us to return to our lands. In fact, we believe that our return will come soon. After all, it is a basic human right. We cling on to this belief today and we will pass it on to our children and our grandchildren.  Mr President,\\\\xa0I turned 20 a few months ago, but until now, I have never set foot in Imwas, the village I come from. I've only heard about it from my grandmother. I recently searched it on Google and found out that Israel built a large garden there. Of course, this garden is for Israelis only. They can walk and hike there, while we, the people of Imwas, are forbidden from visiting our village.  To add to the pain of losing our home and the ongoing difficulties we face in the camp, we recently heard that the United States has decided to [reduce aid](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/cuts-unrwa- funding-180116193513823.html) to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\\\\xa0  UNRWA was established 69 years ago to help refugee families like mine until they are able to return home. A reduction in this agency's funding will be a disaster for us because we are still not allowed to return home. If you do not reverse this decision, this will be the first step in ending the discussion on our future. It will make these \\\"temporary\\\" camps, where we have been waiting for decades, into permanent ones.  We heavily depend on UNRWA's services for our education and healthcare. The school that my younger siblings attend is now under threat of closing down. If this happens, they won't have a place to complete their basic education.  I completed my primary and middle school education at UNRWA schools inside the Qalandia refugee camp. I attended a secondary school in Ramallah, as there was not an UNRWA secondary school in the camp that could accommodate me. Now, I am studying journalism at Birzeit University, West Bank.  I want my younger siblings to also receive an education, but I now fear that there will be no schools for them to attend. I am not the only one worried about this - every parent in the camp is worried about their children's future.  The residents of the camp live in very difficult financial conditions. Most of those who work earn no more meagre salaries. If UNRWA schools close down, many families would not be able to find alternative schools to educate their children because the would not be able to afford transportation costs and private school fees.  The issue does not stop at education. The US decision will also impact UNRWA's health clinics. In Qalandia refugee camp, we only have one medical centre. This medical centre is the only place our children can receive medical care and vaccinations. The closure of this centre, or even a reduction in its services, will have serious repercussions for us. The children will not receive vaccinations, the elderly and the sick will not receive the necessary medical care; we will be facing yet another humanitarian crisis.  I am particularly fearful about my younger brother, Zain. He is not even one year old and like any other baby, he needs several vaccinations. I fear that he will not be able to get them if the centre closes down. I also fear for the brother still inside my mother's womb. I constantly ask myself: Will we be able to vaccinate him? Will we be able to find treatment for my younger siblings if they fall sick one day?  These questions keep me and my mother awake at night.\\\\xa0  In addition to healthcare and education, UNRWA also provides food to many financially disadvantaged families in Qalandia refugee camp. These families may not have food on the table tomorrow if UNRWA's services are cut.\\\\xa0  Most of the poor families who depend on food aid from UNRWA are missing a father and a breadwinner. Their children may go hungry if UNRWA is gone.  Mr President, if the US goes forward with its decision to reduce aid to UNRWA, refugees like me and my family, who had already been forced from their lands and homes, will face a new humanitarian disaster, especially the poorer and more vulnerable families. In the long term, this move will give [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html) green light to continue violating our rights.\\\\xa0  Mr President, will you go back on this decision before it's too late?\\\\xa0   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Dear Mr Trump, we're facing a humanitarian disaster\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/dear-trump-facing-humanitarian-disaster-180131094246849.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ YouTube has deleted the account of Atomwaffen Division, an [American neo-Nazi group](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/06/magazine- documenting-america-white-nationalists-150609095548558.html) that was thrust into the spotlight after several media reports linked it to a spate of murders.  \\\"This account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech,\\\" a banner read on the group's YouTube channel as of Wednesday.

State TV aired footage showing people in several cities waving flags and carrying banners bearing the image of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The large demonstrations, which were organised weeks ago, are held every year.   'They no longer fear security forces'  Potkin Azarmehr, a blogger who focuses on the\\\\xa0secular pro-democracy struggle in Iran, told Al Jazeera that several groups have been protesting for some time \\\"and now their slogans have become more radical\\\".\\\\xa0  \\\"They no longer seem to have that fear from security forces,\\\" he said.  Mahan Abedin, an Iran analyst at Middle East Eye, said the protests reflect the gap between ordinary Iranians and the political elite.      The protests appeared to be \\\"articulated by people who ostensibly have purely economic motives\\\", he said.  \\\"I think in keeping with longstanding culture, inevitably these protests have become political.  \\\"[President Hassan] Rouhani has the right attitude but his government riles people.

His work focused on bringing together relativity - the nature of space and time - and quantum theory - how the smallest particles in the Universe behave - to explain the creation of the Universe and how it is governed.  In 1974, he became one of the youngest fellows of Britain's most prestigious scientific body, the Royal Society, at the age of 32.   In 1979 he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, where he had moved from Oxford University to study theoretical astronomy and cosmology.

The APA says it mistakenly included the osteopathic group, which says it did not participate in the joint statement.  A corrected version of the story is below:  Trump focus on mental health after school shooting denounced  The U.S. medical community is voicing mounting frustration over the Trump administration's focus on mental illness to fight mass violence  By LINDSEY TANNER  AP Medical Writer  Frustration is mounting in the medical community as the Trump administration again points to mental illness in response to yet another mass shooting.  \\\"The concept that mental illness is a precursor to violent behavior is nonsense,\\\" said Dr. Louis Kraus, forensic psychiatry chief at Chicago's Rush University Medical College. \\\"The vast majority of gun violence is not attributable to mental illness.\\\"  Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old charged with killing 17 people on Valentine's Day at his former high school in Parkland, Florida, has been described by students as a loner with troubling behavior who had been kicked out of school. His mother recently died and Cruz had been staying with family friends.  Since the shooting, his mental health has been the focus of President Donald Trump's comments. And on a Thursday call with reporters, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the administration is committed to addressing serious mental illness and that his agency \\\"will be laser-focused on this issue in the days, weeks, and months to come.\\\" > So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! > > 4 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [February 15, 2018](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964110212885106689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)   Mental health professionals welcome more resources and attention, but they say the administration is ignoring the real problem 4 easy access to guns, particularly the kind of high-powered highly lethal assault weapons used in many of the most recent mass shootings.  \\\"Even for those who manage to survive gun violence involving these weapons, the severity and lasting impact of their wounds, disabilities and treatment leads to devastating consequences,\\\" American Medical Association President David Barbe wrote in an online column after the shooting.  \\\"We are not talking about Second Amendment rights or restricting your ability to own a firearm. We are talking about a public health crisis that our Congress has failed to address. This must end,\\\" Barbe wrote.  Better access to mental health care, including for those who might be prone to violence, is important, but \\\"to blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient,\\\" he said in an interview Friday.  The AMA has supported efforts to boost gun violence research, ban assault weapons and to restrict access to automatic weapons. Barbe wrote in his column that federally funded research is crucial to address an \\\"urgent health crisis.\\\"  Under gun industry pressure, U.S. government research on firearm violence has been limited for decades.  The American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and three other medical associations issued a joint statement Friday urging comprehensive action by Trump and Congress, including labeling gun violence a national public health epidemic.  The groups' recommendations include limits on high-powered, rapid-fire weapons designed to kill and funding gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  According to the CDC, there were about 38,000 U.S. gun deaths in 2016, slightly more than the number of people who died in car crashes.  \\\"The families of the victims in Parkland and all those whose lives have been impacted by daily acts of gun violence deserve more than our thoughts and prayers. They need action from the highest levels of our government to stop this epidemic of gun violence now,\\\" the groups said in a statement.  The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists contributed to the statement.  The president views gun owners as a key constituency that helped deliver him to the White House.  Before he was a candidate, Trump at one point favored some tighter gun regulations. But he embraced gun rights as a candidate, and the NRA spent $30 million in support of his campaign.  His latest budget request would slash Medicaid, the major source of federal funding for treating mental health problems, and cut school safety programs by more than a third. Last year, he signed a resolution blocking an Obama-era rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain mentally disabled people.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Sunday that Trump is working with senators on a bill designed to improve criminal background checks. \\\"While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the President is supportive of efforts to improve the Federal background check system,\\\" she said.  Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, a Trump ally, said he had discussed with Trump and GOP leaders how to restrict gun access to the mentally ill.  Federal and state laws already attempt to do this, in many cases with a ban on gun ownership for people who have been treated in mental institutions.  \\\"There's a great naivete to what the president and the governor are proposing,\\\" Kraus said. A history of violent behavior, alcohol and substance use, and previous criminal behavior are all more pertinent factors to consider.  Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of a violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis, said gun violence restraining order laws in California and Washington are \\\"a much more focused approach.\\\" The laws allow courts to keep guns out of the hands of people who pose threats to themselves or others.  \\\"Florida has no such mechanism. Could have prevented this one; there was plenty of advance notice,\\\" Wintemute said.  ___  AP Writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this story from West Palm Beach, Fla.  ___  Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter at @LindseyTanner.

During that run, the 17-year-old Kim got a lot more cheers from the audience than most US athletes because she is ethnically Korean, having been born in the US to parents who migrated from South Korea.  Kim's success has sparked a conversation in South Korea over whether she would have risen to the top had she been born and raised in Korea.  Some suggested that had that happened, she would have spent her youth studying all day instead of developing her creative snowboard style.  South Korea has not produced any star athletes in snow sports but it has put up significant Winter Olympics achievements in a short time. No athlete from the country had won a Winter Olympics medal until 1992, when the country came away with four.  That number rose to 14, the country's best-ever performance, at the 2010 Vancouver Games.  Winter sports is just one area in which South Korea has come a long way in a short time, having risen from post-war poverty in the 1950s to becoming one of the world's richest countries in a matter of decades.  To fuel this rise, South Koreans work longer hours than most of their counterparts in other developed countries, sleep less and take shorter vacations.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/11/b04e2c5ec2e649418ef4d79cd0e47c03_18.jpg)  ---   However, it also leaves some of them ill-prepared for what to do with the rest of their lives when their sports dreams fizzle [Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters]      The athletes apply this kind of vigor to training, dedicating themselves to their sport from a young age, while foregoing other aspects of youth, such as socialising, hobbies, even their studies.  South Korea's ice dancer at Pyeongchang 2018 Yura Min grew up in the US but said her family was \\\"culturally very Korean\\\" and, as a child, Korean was her first language and her parents inculcated strict work habits in her from a young age.  She started skating aged six and remembers waking up at 4:30am for practice followed by a full day at school.  After school, she would go for violin, taekwondo and ballet classes in the evenings. As her talent for skating became clear, she gave up those other activities and her life began to revolve around time on the ice.  \\\"My mom would follow me to my training, and my dad would work,\\\" said Min.  \\\"I only remember a handful of times where we all sat down and had dinner. I wish we could all sit around and talk about our days, but we all had other things to do.\\\"   Physically taxing  Analysts believe junior South Korean athletes are asked to sacrifice too much, that their training regimes are physically taxing and rob them of the chance to enjoy normal, balanced youths.  \\\"Unlike other countries, in South Korea there aren't child athletes who compete just for the fun of it. Once South Korean kids start training, they have to give up on their studies and focus all of their time, from morning till night, on training,\\\" Chung Hee-joon, professor of sports science at Dong-A University, told Al Jazeera.  South Korea's job market, too, is challenging at the best of times. Thousands of university graduates are competing for a limited number of stable and well- paid jobs at large companies.  Former athletes can find it difficult to get hired - during their youth, they did not have the time to develop the kinds of skills employers look for.  A 2013 study of 3,000 former athletes by the Korea Institute of Sports Science found that roughly a third of the athletes they surveyed ended up unemployed.  \\\"It is very difficult for athletes to get jobs other than through their parents' connections, or taking on a family business,\\\" Chung added.  \\\"Nowadays, athletes tend to mostly come from wealthy families who can afford the costs of training and the risks involved.\\\"\\\\xa0  But things are gradually improving. The government appears to be taking notice of the challenges faced by retiring athletes, and is allocating resources to helping them prepare for their futures.  > Nowadays, athletes tend to mostly come from wealthy families who can afford the costs of training and the risks involved.\\\\r > > Chung Hee-joon, professor of sports science at Dong-A University > >   Park Seong-hee, a professor of sports management at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, has, for nearly a decade, worked on a South Korean government programme that counsels and assists post-career athletes.  He said more South Korean athletes are making that transition successfully now.  \\\"The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism has reformed the sports system from the grassroots level and tried to build a sound 'sports development system,'\\\" Park said.  \\\"The government is also developing many after-career programmes for athletes, such as English education, sports industry education, retirement programmes, and graduate school scholarships.  \\\"Many athletes see the end of their careers as a death sentence. They often don't have the confidence to move forward because all they have done in their lives to that point is play sports.\\\"  Min graduated high school but decided to forego university to focus on skating.  At age 22, she still has several years of competition ahead of her, and plans to compete in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.  Once she hangs up her skates, she hopes to make her career either as a coach or in another role in South Korea's ice skating federation.  \\\"Korea doesn't yet have the infrastructure of coaching and training that is needed for ice dancing, and I'd like to help establish that,\\\" she said.  South Koreans hope that in four years time, they will have a breakout athlete of their own.   Too young to compete  Many are pinning hopes on figure skating prodigy You Young who, at 13 years of age, is too young to compete in this year's event.  She has been famous in South Korea since she caught the eyes of the masses in 2016, when, aged just 11, she became the youngest national champion in the country's history.  You wowed the audience with her ability to pull off tricks that befuddle skaters who are older and physically more mature than her. Many hope she can follow in the footsteps of South Korea's Kim Yuna, who won figure skating gold at the 2010 Winter Olympics.  But reaching this level of excellence is not by accident.  You adheres to a demanding schedule that has her training for several hours daily and eschewing the time for hobbies and friends that most 11-year-olds partake in.  Between now and Beijing 2022, she will continue with her all-out training schedule.  This push comes at a time when South Korea is starting to question its custom of all-out preparation for athletic success, as well as harsh standards of preparation and sacrifice that groom countless young people for athletic dreams.  However, it also leaves some of them ill-prepared for what to do with the rest of their lives when their sports dreams fizzle. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"The price of success for young South Korean athletes\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/price-success-young-south-korean-athletes-180211120942233.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ The oldest human remains found in the UK belonged to a man with dark skin and blue eyes, a study by scientists in the [UK](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html) has found.

He will be blamed for taking a once prestigious liberation party to the edge of disrepair. But it is the acute sense of betrayal of common South Africans that is most likely to resonate most.  Zuma became president of [South Africa](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-africa.html) in 2009 under the most casuistic of circumstances.   Populist lies  Having been [fired](http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/president-thabo- mbeki-sacks-deputy-president-jacob-zuma) as deputy president by former president Thabo Mbeki in 2005 over a corruption scandal, Zuma managed to dress himself up as a victim of a witch-hunt.  Two years later, he won the ANC leadership, dragging trade unions and the working class into a spire of populist lies in which he claimed to represent their interests. He subsequently became president of the country when the ANC won the 2009 national elections.  Under his watch, South Africa struggled to create jobs and meet its growth targets.  According to Phumlani Majozi, non-executive director at the Free Market Foundation based in Johannesburg, unemployment[ rose](https://africacheck.org/reports/anc-job-creation-boast-ignores-sas- increased-unemployment-rate/%20) from 22-28 percent under his watch.  \\\"The country descended to junk status and national debt has risen under him,\\\" Majozi told Al Jazeera.  Analysts say as Zuma became increasingly embroiled in one corruption scandal after another, he set about interfering with state institutions, placing\\\\xa0loyalists in key positions as he looked to build an impenetrable empire.  \\\"His departure will be his main legacy. It will set an important limit on the undue exercise of presidential power,\\\" Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, activist and author of Democracy and Delusion, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"South Africa will look back and wonder how we allowed a president so reprehensible to last so long in office,\\\" Mpofu-Walsh said.  Ayesha Omar, a lecturer in political science at Wits University, said Zuma possibly \\\"brought the ANC to its lowest point since its inception\\\".   But for others, such as Steven Friedman, director for the Study of Democracy at the University of Johannesburg, Zuma was always merely a symptom of a larger malaise in the ANC and government.  \\\"The system rewards patronage. This is why people join politics in this country. They know that if you get an 'in' into the system, you will make it.  \\\"This culture did not start with Zuma,\\\" Friedman told Al Jazeera.   Rising inequality  It is a view shared by 26-year-old student activist Wandile Gewu, who says state corruption has always been widespread. The focus on Zuma, he said, is exaggerated and part of an attempt to derail a larger Zuma project known as radical economic transformation.  According to [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/bp- reward-work-not-wealth-220118-summ-en.pdf%20), the top 10 percent of South African society earns half of all wages, whereas the bottom 50 percent of the country's workforce receives just 12 percent of all wages.  When broken down by race, Stats South Africa says white people earn[ five times more](https://businesstech.co.za/news/wealth/153485/whites-earn-5-times- more-than-blacks-in-south-africa-stats-sa/) than black people in the country.\\\\xa0Zuma supporters say it was the former president who introduced free tertiary education for the poor and looked to end the privilege of what is known in South Africa as white monopoly capital.  \\\"He is the only president in the history of the ANC who had the courage to fight it head-on,\\\" Gewu said.  Mpendulo Khwela, 27, also a student based in Durban, told Al Jazeera it was Zuma who brought South Africa into BRICS, a group of five emerging economies, \\\"that looks to boost and sustain the country's economy\\\".  But analysts say Zuma achieved little other than lining his own pockets.  \\\"Look, I'd say that the Zuma administration was aggressive when it came to tackling the HIV pandemic and scaling up the ARV [drug] treatment programme. But other than that, it's hard to point out any positives from his presidency,\\\" said Majozi from the Free Market Foundation.  The move to make higher education free for working class and poor students is seen by many as untenable and merely populist attempts to hold on to power. \\\"Even if free education is ideal, it's unclear how we can afford it in our current circumstances,\\\" Majozi said.  The burning question of land redistribution, considered among the most pressing issues of post-apartheid South Africa, was routinely put off and slow under Zuma's watch. It was only in 2017 that he began pushing for land expropriation without compensation.   Fraught legacy  Omar said Zuma's legacy will be \\\"characterised by populist opportunism, corruption, state capture and an utter disregard for constitutionalism\\\".  \\\"The country has found itself in a dire economic situation with staggeringly high rates of unemployment because of reckless leadership,\\\" said Omar.  Friedman emphasised that \\\"Zuma tried to make the state his private property\\\".  In 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled Zuma had \\\"failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution\\\" when he refused to pay heed to the public prosecutor's findings that he had to pay back a portion of state funds used to upgrade his rural home in Nkandla.  The opposition began impeachment proceedings in parliament, but this failed, too, when the ANC majority in parliament voted against the move. In December 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that parliament had violated the Constitution, too. This ruling, and the election of [Cyril Ramaphosa](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/cyril-ramaphosa-anc- leader-171218180222503.html) as the new leader of the ANC, set into motion the move to pressure Zuma to step down  \\\"Whatever happens, no one is going to say, 'Oh, I wish Zuma was here,'\\\" Friedman said.  Mthembu, still sitting on the bench, said he will have to come back in a few days to deliver more CVs to potential employers. He said the system is unfair and wonders if Zuma will face prosecution in the days to come.  \\\"If I commit a crime, I won't find a job. I will be marked as 'dirty'. How is it that the president can steal, be a criminal and continue to lead a nation?'\\\" he said.  \\\"You want to know how I will remember Zuma? Well, I guess he could dance.

However, since 2015 some schools have allowed the teaching of mother-tongue languages as a second language.  So, Kyaw Hla Maung chose not to record his teachings on paper but instead tattooed the consonants and vowels of one of the ancient Brahmi script on his skin.  Last year, Rakhine State made headlines around the world because of a military crackdown, which forced more than 600,000 [Rohingya ](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/rohingya.html)into neighbouring [Bangladesh](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bangladesh.html). The Rakhine consider the Rohingya outsiders from Bangladesh, and in some cases, have participated in the violence against them.  What is less known is that the Rakhine people also have a history of being oppressed - by the Burmese military, which enforced a rule of 'Burmanisation' or forcing the culture of the Burmese people on the country's various ethnic groups, many of whom have been at war with the central government since Myanmar's independence from the British.   Policy of 'Burmanisation'  Kyaw Hla Maung wants to revive the teaching of the state's history and study of the Rakhine language.  The 64-year-old believes that learning about the history of different ethnic and religious groups in the state is important to rebuilding peace, especially with the Rohingya.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/3/26/43a68ee09e4343d3867ddc639534a256_18.jpg)  ---   Kyaw Hla Maung believes that learning about the history of different ethnic and religious groups in the state is important to rebuild peace, especially with the Rohingya [Libby Hogan/Al Jazeera]      Kyaw Hla Maung, 64, looks more like a rock star than a historian. Dressed in a navy fitted top and flared pants, he now works as a tour guide trainer in Mrauk U, the ancient seat of the Rakhine kingdom.  While the Rakhine language is now openly used and widely spoken, teachers usually volunteer to teach language classes after hours in schools. Government schools and colleges still only allow the Burmese language to be taught.       ---  \\\\xa0     Under the military rule, a policy of \\\"Burmanisation\\\" resulted in the adoption of Burmese as the official language and schools across the country were forced to implement it. Ethnic language teaching was banned in public schools for four decades.  Kyaw Hla Maung said he was taught Rakhine language and history by his father, grandfather and local historian, Oo Tha Htun, whom he proudly calls his 'grand master'.  \\\"I did my learning deep in the forest because if soldiers or police came, there was lots of problems for us,\\\" he said.  In the jungle, not far from the ruins of Mrauk U, they taught him how to read stone inscriptions telling the history of the different periods of Rakhine history - Dhanyawadi, Vesali, Le Mro and Mrauk U - as well as traditional songs such as \\\"Buddha pujarniya\\\", about previous reigning kings.  The lessons came to an abrupt halt when Oo Tha Htun was arrested in 1990 and later died in prison in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine. Kyaw Hla Maung believes his teacher was arrested for a speech he made about Rakhine oppression under the Burmese government.   Brahmi script  After Oo Tha Htun's death, Kyaw Hla Maung, afraid of forgetting his grandfather's teachings, tattooed the Brahmi script on his arms.  The script is key to reading the stone inscriptions around the Mrauk U archaeological zone as it was used by the first of the four [dynastic eras](https://archive.org/details/PAMELAGUTMANBURMASLOSTKINGDOMSSPLENDOURSBookZa.org) of Rakhine State, the Dhanyawadi dynasty, around the mid 4th-century.  The Mrauk U kingdom was known as the golden age of Rakhine. It was a thriving multi-ethnic and multi-faith court that ruled over Rakhine from the 14th to the 18th century. The capital, Mrauk U, was once an important trading hub frequented by Portuguese, Dutch, Armenian, Arab and Persian traders.   {articleGUID}   From across the sea, the influence of Bengal also resulted in a distinct Muslim influence in Buddhist architecture, and Mrauk U rulers minted coins in both Arabic and Arakanese.  The people of Rakhine enjoyed prosperity up until the late 18th century when the Mrauk U empire was annexed by the Burmese Konbaung Dynasty, and many Rakhine people were taken prisoner.  The British arrived in Burma in the 19th century, bringing with them tens of thousands of migrant labourers from Bengal to work in paddy fields, creating tension with the local population in the Rakhine state. Historians, however, say the Rohingya's history goes as far back as the eighth century.  Mrauk U has remained a relatively peaceful city compared with the rest of Rakhine State with majority Buddhists co-existing with people from other faiths and ethnicities.  Apart from the Rakhine and Rohingya, Mro, Chin, Dynet and Thet ethnic minorities have lived in Rakhine State for centuries.  In today's Myanmar, Rakhine State is one of the poorest regions in the country, riven by ethnic tensions and several conflicts, including one by the Arakan Army, a Rakhine armed group at war with the military for \\\"self- determination of the multi-ethnic Arakanese population\\\".

Authorities in troubled parts of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslim minority, ban children from attending religious events.  But religious communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions.  Fear of Muslim influence has grown in China in recent years, sparked in part by violence in Xinjiang.

The lone attacker, Foyzur Rahman, was caught before he could continue stabbing Iqbal from behind. The 24-year-old attacker later said he wanted to kill Iqbal because he believed the academic was an \\\"an enemy of Islam\\\".  Iqbal, who has authored more than 200 books, is now out of danger and is recuperating at the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in the capital, Dhaka, according to his wife, Yasmin Haque.  The stabbing has brought back memories of a series of [fatal attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/secular-publisher-hacked- death-bangladesh-151031151220898.html) against secular bloggers in [Bangladesh](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bangladesh.html) nearly three years ago.  Investigators have made progress in probing the knife attack in which Iqbal sustained injuries to his head, back and left hand.  The Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime Unit (CTTC), a special unit of the Bangladesh Police who took charge of the investigation, have found some evidence that links Rahman with a right-wing forum named Dawah Ilallah.  Dawah Ilallah is an internet forum run by the banned Bangladeshi outfit Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and Ansar al-Islam, which were blamed for the spate of deadly attacks against secular bloggers.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   Terming the matter \\\"an ongoing investigation\\\", an official of the CTTC, who preferred anonymity, told Al Jazeera that the forum labelled Iqbal an atheist, and held frequent discussions on possible ways to kill him.

The case of Zafar Iqbal  On March 5, at a protest meeting in Dhaka's Shahbagh, Haque said her husband wrote more than 200 books and none of those has \\\"anything that goes against the Islamic sentiment\\\".  \\\"Had he [Rahman] read any of his books, he wouldn't have done anything like that,\\\" Haque said at the rally.  While Iqbal has never styled himself as an atheist or was believed to have said anything that goes against Islam, he has been a staunch critic of Islamist politics and growing intolerance in Bangladeshi society.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/3/13/76db2544950b47f8b6103cef7830ef56_18.jpg)  ---  Students where Iqbal teaches rallied in support of the academic after the attack. [Nafis Tiham/Al Jazeera]     His father, who worked as a police officer in what was then Eastern [Pakistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Pakistan.html), was killed during the 1971 liberation war.  He comes from a family of writers. His elder brother, late Humayun Ahmed, is the most popular and highest-selling Bangladeshi writer of all time. His younger brother Ahsan Habib is a satire writer and the editor of Bangladesh's only monthly satire magazine, Unmad, which means\\\\xa0\\\"madman\\\".  After his PhD from the University of Washington, he went on to work as a scientist at the renowned Bell Laboratory in California.  In the early 2000s, he came back to Bangladesh to join Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in the northeastern Sylhet district as a professor of electrical and electronics engineering.  \\\"Zafar Iqbal left a high-salaried job at a very prestigious research lab in the US and got back to his homeland to work for it,\\\" said Mohammad Kaykobad, a friend of Iqbal.  Kaykobad, a professor of computer science and engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (BUET), has co-authored several popular science books with Iqbal.  As advocates of popularising science education, both Iqbal and Kaykobad helped launch the national level Mathematics Olympiad and Computer Programming contest in the South Asian country of 150 million.  \\\"Prof Iqbal has contributed a lot to the education sector of Bangladesh. He genuinely cares and has tremendous belief in the talent and power of Bangladeshi people,\\\" Kaykobad told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Many of us don't talk \\\\u2026 as we fear repercussions. But he didn't,\\\" said the BUET Professor, alluding to Iqbal's outspoken nature.   Why was he attacked?  Since Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League party became prime minister in 2009, Iqbal has been an active advocate of the War Crime Tribunal, which was set up to punish those accused of committing atrocities during the 1971 liberation war from Pakistan.  The Tribunal has handed out capital punishments to a number of senior leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami - the largest Islamist party - and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.  The Jamaat, which has since been banned from contesting elections, has accused the Hasina government of politicising the Tribunal, while the International Commission of Jurists has stated that the tribunal does \\\"not adhere to international standards of a fair trial and due process\\\".\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   The author became a household name through his books that included science fiction, children's stories, and other fiction and non-fiction, but in recent years he has received criticism, particularly on social media, for his stand against Islamist politics.  Bangladeshi political analyst Zia Hassan says he \\\"personally in many ways opposes the rhetoric of Professor Iqbal, which looks at the country through the simplistic narrative of pro versus against Liberation War\\\".  This perspective has now been used as a shield to protect the incumbent government's numerous misdeeds, Hassan said, adding that he, however, would like to condemn the attack on him [Iqbal] \\\"strongly\\\".  Hassan said a lot of people have genuine concerns about the state of the nation and how the ruling party has suppressed dissent.  \\\"Since [Zafar] Iqbal is sympathetic with the ruling party and blind to its misdeeds, he has now become a foremost target and there has been a concerted effort to vilify him for the things he is not responsible for.\\\"  Every person is entitled to have his political view and \\\"those who oppose Iqbal can oppose him through debates - which we have done. The government must take efforts to protect him\\\", Hassan said.  The Bangladeshi author's perception as \\\"anti-Islamist\\\" is also due to his writings, says Asif Shibgat Bhuiyah, a popular Bangladeshi blogger known for his advocacy on Islamic scholarship.  \\\"A lot of Iqbal's writings, especially the ones written for children, are of propagandist nature,\\\" Bhuiyah told Al Jazeera.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   In many of his books, a bearded or pious man is ultimately represented as a bad person or a villain, he said.  Such action from Iqbal has earned criticism because people \\\"expected a rational and impartial attitude from a person of such intellect and capacity as Iqbal,\\\" said Bhuiyah  The blogger says the attack on Iqbal is an outcome of blind and blatant hatred that some people acquire in a highly divisive society like Bangladesh.  \\\"I fear, this will harm the Bangladeshi society in a severe way.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Bangladesh: Why was science fiction writer Zafar Iqbal attacked?\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/bangladesh-science-fiction-writer-zafar-iqbal-attacked-180313093958357.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ For people in the English speaking parts of [Cameroon](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/cameroon.html), free speech on the internet has become all but impossible.

The Anglophones [claimed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/cameroon- teachers-lawyers-strike-english-161205095929616.html) they face discrimination and that they were excluded from state jobs as a result of their limited French language skills.   {articleGUID}   \\\"The Anglophone regions feel neglected and left out of the national government's agenda,\\\" Peter Micek of digital rights organisation Access Now told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Then, the government took the extreme measure to shut down the internet completely,\\\" he said.  The first shutdown lasted 93 days, from January to April 2017.  \\\"It was devastating. People didn 9t know how to work around it,\\\" Judith Nwana said, adding that the whole society was affected; education, money transfers, healthcare and businesses all relied on internet access, which was now shutdown.  Eventually, internet access was restored in April after international pressure from, among others, the United Nations and Pope Francis.  However, in October a second, more targeted shutdown was enacted after renewed protests in the Anglophone areas.  The new blockade took aim at social media and messaging apps. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp were all shut down.  But by this time, many Cameroonians were prepared, using VPN services to circumvent the blockade.  \\\"Unfortunately, VPNs are expensive and not everyone can afford one or had budgeted for one. Regardless, businesses, the tech industry, healthcare and education are seriously affected,\\\" Nwana said.  One of those affected businesses belongs to Mambe Churchill Nanje, a software engineer and CEO and founder of Njorku, a search engine that allows people all over Africa to look for jobs.  Nanje is based in Silicon Mountain, a tech-hub based and around in the city of Buea, which was hit hard by both shutdowns.  \\\"They not only affected me and my business, but the whole of Silicon Mountain,\\\" Nanje told Al Jazeera.  \\\"It has pushed out a lot of the talent [at Silicon Mountain].

The first shutdown alone cost the country at least $38m, Nwana added. The effects of the second blockade are not as severe economically, but Nwana emphasised there is more than just monetary loss.  \\\"Shutting down social media sites is akin to shutting down the internet. It's how people communicate today.

She later worked for a non-governmental organization before joining the Pakistan People's Party of the assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  The party nominated her for a seat reserved for minority candidates from the Sindh province, where it holds a majority.  \\\"I will continue to work for the rights of the oppressed people, especially for the empowerment of women, their health and education,\\\" she said.  Pakistan's Hindus make up around two percent of the country's 200 million people.   Reactions  The victory of opposition candidate Kohli in the Senate election stirred a wave of optimism on social media, as Pakistanis celebrated the rare success for a woman from a marginalised community at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy.  \\\"Kudos to PPP for electing KrishnaKohli....

The besuited directors of a more humane, liberalised and inclusive capitalism -\\\\xa0a Democratic Party type of capitalism\\\\xa0- were being usurped in favour of the rabid irrationality and apocalyptic bluster of the far right.  A monster was birthed. And all at the behest of a population whose frustration and ignorance, especially that of the poorer elements, had bubbled over, yielding a toxic age of unreason.\\\\xa0  Specifically, the notion of a \\\"white working class\\\" became\\\\xa0de rigueur. Liberals at dinner parties described this entity in terms which were both sorrowful and condescending.\\\\xa0Having seen a decline in their economic level, \\\"white workers\\\", it was argued, had sought solace in the catharsis provided by hatred of the \\\"other\\\" - of minority groups - and thus afforded themselves a form of cultural compensation, a sense of social superiority, as a palliative to political and economic despair.\\\\xa0  The mainstream media proliferated the same image. The rise of Trump had been facilitated by \\\"a white working class\\\" who lacked the education and agency to see they were being manipulated for demagogic ends.  \\\"The white working class\\\" became a stand-in for the age-old concept of \\\"the mob\\\", the legions of people at the bottom whose irascibility, irrationality and ignorance could be whipped up, unleashing the maelstrom; or, to say the same, \\\"the white working class\\\" became the perfect placeholder for the anxiety and prejudice of the middle classes towards the people at the bottom.   {articleGUID}   A\\\\xa0[2016 article ](https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer)from National Review[ _\\\\xa0_](https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer)captured the sneering, fearful mentality[](https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer) \\\\xa0to a tee: \\\"The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\\\"  Without delving into the dubious sociological merits of the concept of \\\"the white working class\\\" - i.e. a group of workers on a nationwide scale who have a social basis and a set of interests fundamentally at odds with the working classes as a whole - one should note that the purveyors and peddlers of such a fiction have a hard time coming to grips with the notion of class per se.  Indeed, most of the polls that took place in 2016 relating to the presidential election defined class, specifically the working class, in purely cosmetic terms. The methodological criteria did not depend on information about how people earned their living but rather revolved around more superficial considerations like whether they had college degrees or not - without taking into account that many such people, who supported Trump, were affluent despite their lack of a university education.  > The concept of a 'white working class' who voted in droves for Trump, allows a more mundane truth to be masked.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   However, the biggest survey to take the measure of the 2016 election carried out by the American National Election Study revealed that, among \\\"people who said they voted for Trump in the general election,\\\\xa035 percent had household incomes under $50,000 per year\\\".  A similar statistic came out of a March 2016 NBC survey which showed that \\\"only a third of Trump supporters had household incomes at or below the national median of about $50,000. Another third made $50,000 to $100,000, and another third made $100,000 or more, and that was true even when we limited the analysis to only non-Hispanic whites.\\\" If one assumes that working class jobs tend to fall at the lower end of the economic spectrum, then one has to conclude that the vast majority of Trump supporters in the run-up to the 2016 election were simply not of the working class.  But the concept of a \\\"white working class\\\" who voted in droves for Trump, allows a more mundane truth to be masked.\\\\xa0In 2008, when [Barack Obama](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/barack-obama.html) swept into the White House on the heady promise of \\\"change\\\", 61.6 percent of those eligible to vote in the population did so. Yet in 2016, when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic candidate\\\\xa0that number [had fallen](https://www.factcheck.org/2009/01/2008-voter-turnout/) drastically to 58.1 percent\\\\xa0- millions of those who turned out before now chose to stay at home. What had changed?  During his\\\\xa0eight years in office, Obama failed to deliver on the alternative and transformative politics voters had been encouraged to expect. He promised to close the prison camp and torture hotbed of [Guantanamo](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/guantanamo-bay.html). He didn't.  He swore to recall all US troops from the bloody quagmire of Iraq, but US forces were still being sent there during the final year of his presidency.\\\\xa0He helped create a more militarised police force and under his watch the slaying of unarmed blacks, including children, became epidemic.\\\\xa0  And while Trump's toxic anti-immigration policies are sufficiently well known, what is not common knowledge is how\\\\xa0under Obama's tenure more than 2.5 million people were deported, a figure which exceeds that of any previous president.  Obama broke his pledge on introducing \\\"card checks\\\" - a system that would have made access to union membership for workers easier. At the same time, he fortified the rapacious and corrupt cabal of bankers and financiers who had helped facilitate the global economic crisis by barring the justice department from prosecuting those at the top of the largest banks. And, of course, he bailed out the banks.  A deteriorating, increasingly defunct form of managerial capitalism established by slick corporate figures rang more and more hollow, and swaths of people lost the impetus and motivation to vote for Clinton in 2016 - precisely because she offered much of the same. The concept of \\\"the white working class\\\", however, helps rescue this rather jaundiced liberalism from the mire, for it allows the pro-Clintonite liberal to perform a rather neat reversal.  The move from Obama to Trump is no longer conceived of in terms of the shattered promises made by those at the top of the Democratic Party as they endeavour to better grease the neoliberal machine through the promotion of a glittering financial elite and the prosaic, murderous routines of empire.  Rather it is recast in a melancholy lament for a more rational age, whereby a more humane set of political actors are eventually and tragically consumed by a political barbarism which has been foisted upon the nation courtesy of those at the bottom, the spectre of Trump issuing out of the seething, furious tumult of \\\"the white working class\\\".\\\\xa0   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Here be monsters: Trump's \\\"white working class\\\"\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/monsters-trump-white-working-class-180117104213439.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[] \", \n         \"source\": \"Associated Press\", \n         \"title\": \"AI in the court: When algorithms rule on jail time...\", \n         \"url\": \"https://apnews.com/20efb1d707c24bf2b169584cf75c8e6a\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ For fixers, news stories are often personal.  They are locals, sometimes journalists themselves, who serve as guides for foreign correspondents.  Equipped with intimate local knowledge, they find stories, secure interviews, and translate for correspondents who may have little experience in the country they are reporting from.  Long after those correspondents have left, fixers remain in their communities.  If they become associated with a controversial story, the consequences can be severe - public backlash, imprisonment or worse - regardless of whether the fixer had any influence over how the story was told.  In 2017, 450 fixers and reporters were asked about their relationship for a [survey](https://globalreportingcentre.org/fixers/) by the Global Reporting Centre.  Most fixers said they felt they were often or always relied upon for logistical guidance; many said they believed their trust had been violated - some in terms of editorial content, for others the violation related to financial matters. Many said they rarely received credit for a story and a small number said they - or their relatives - had been put in future harm.  But the possibility of helping to shape how their countries are represented in the media can be a powerful pull.

Three months ago our university organised a cricket tournament and I was selected best player.  I grew up inside camps with a lot of other people. There were six rooms in a shelter and each room was eight by 10 feet. Outside of my house, there were a lot of families, at least 30 or more.  My childhood memories [involve a lot] of struggles because we didn 9t get any facilities for studying or [medical care] and we don 9t have any permanent rights as human beings.   {articleGUID}   The sky that I saw, the environment I was in from the time I woke up in until the time I went to bed was the same. We have been passing our long years [here].  It was very heartbreaking [for my family]. Around the time I was born, my five- or six-year-old brother Noor Islam died because of the lack of proper treatment.  Even now, most of the Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh but they don't get proper treatment.  You are a human being. Is it possible to live with only primary medical support? I am asking you. Is it possible to live through a dangerous sickness or life-threatening problem - is primary treatment enough for you? I think not.  For the past five years, I have been fixing and translating with media. I get pleasure from this work.  I have worked with many different journalists so now I can give comments or suggestions or reports, because I have knowledge about a certain topic.  [One story I helped fix for Arabic-speaking outlets] was about Jamalida. Jamalida was one of the brave girls who was raped by the military and lost her husband who she loved very much.  I become nervous listening to some stories because I have no words to tell them, nothing to explain their situation.  It is important to me to meet many kinds of people and communities. I can learn many things just from hearing someone explain their feelings, and I can be a witness to their problem or condition or situation.   {articleGUID}   Another important thing is showing hospitality. For a guy who comes to take photos or do a report, I can guide him and share many things with him.  Another point is that I don't have other options being a Rohingya refugee. After I finish studying, what would I do, who would accept me, how would I get a job in Bangladesh or somewhere else? I don't know, but there is nothing preventing me from being a fixer and I do useful work.  Most of the people I work with love me and are supportive of my education.  My parents also motivate me and support me. But my family still cannot support me for my education because they don't have much money.  Sometimes I face difficult situations. Last year, I couldn't pay my semester fee and I felt like I had failed. I felt totally senseless and I cried. **** But by the blessings of the mighty God, I asked one of my friends if they could help and I collected money from others.  I motivate myself and have set goals for my life, including completing my graduation. Even though I am Rohingya, I have a life and goals like other Bengali people.\\\"   ** _This interview has been edited for clarity and length_**   ** _* Name changed to protect\\\\xa0identity_**  \\\\---   _Read about other fixers in the series here:_  [Ukraine: A female fixer on the front lines](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/ukraine-female-fixer-front- lines-180315110039837.html)  [From child soldier to fixer: Alain's story](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/child-soldier-fixer-alain- story-180315122607809.html) ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"'I have no words to tell them': A Rohingya fixer\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/words-rohingya-fixer-180315114943781.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people /narendra-modi-141021134051524.html) has warned against \\\"threats to global civilisation\\\" in his opening address at the World Economic Forum in [Switzerland](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/switzerland.html).

Government statistics show there are about 25,000 single mothers in South Korea, a figure questioned by KUMFA and the Korean Unwed Mothers Support Network who believe there are those who do not register due to fear of discrimination.  \\\"Relatives gathering for holidays often don't want unmarried mothers attending because it reminds them that there's a black sheep in the family,\\\" said Hye- ryeon Noh, a professor of social welfare at Soongsil University.   {articleGUID}   \\\"It's a real stigma to the family itself and a sign that they didn't raise the woman well.\\\"  For Jeong, her most heartbreaking Seollal was the one she spent alone in 2011, eight months pregnant with Ah-jeong.  Jeong had already split up with her boyfriend when she found out she was pregnant at 29. He denied the baby was his and refused to support her.  Crushed by shame, she was too scared to face her parents or seek outside help and ended up giving birth alone.  \\\"Society tells unwed mothers it's their fault, and they are not responsible people,\\\" said Jeong before adding that, because of widespread cultural bias, it was difficult for unmarried mothers to maintain family relationships, find jobs, make friends and meet a partner.  \\\"I had no confidence that I could survive as an unwed mother in Korea.\\\"  Within the first month of motherhood, Jeong felt so desperate she gave her baby up for adoption.  Three days later, she reversed her decision, realising the only thing harder than being a single mother was not being a mother at all.  To regain custody, Jeong had to bring her parents to the agency to sign a consent form and pay a fee. That's when her parents first learned of their granddaughter.  \\\"My father rejected her. He insisted I had to let her live in the adoption agency ... because he thought I wasn't qualified to be a mother.\\\"  Angry and humiliated, her father begrudgingly allowed Ah-jeong back into their family but demanded they keep her a secret.  That is when Jeong went in search of a new family, eventually finding KUMFA.   A different kind of family  KUMFA was conceived of by a group of single mothers who, grappling with prejudice, reached out to each other online and decided to meet and formalise their community offline.  Among the founding group was Kim Do-kyeong, a 43-year-old single mother of one, who serves as KUMFA's president.  Up until her son Tae-ho, now 11, reached first grade, Kim's parents shunned them, telling her to give him away and start life over.  They excluded her from celebrations and told neighbours made-up stories of a husband working abroad, all to protect the family's reputation.  For Tae-ho, who has grown up among his mom's community, it feels like his community, too. When Tae-ho is bullied at school by classmates whose mothers have instructed them not to play with him, or who tease him for being without a father, he turns to his KUMFA friends, Kim said.  In addition, the members also advocate for increased government support for single mothers, only a small fraction of whom receive any financial assistance from their children's fathers.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/27/bf46c45d152d4f4993d27e8ccde87435_18.jpg)  ---  Yoonori is one of the games the children enjoyed during the celebrations [Ann Babe/Al Jazeera]     Under the current welfare policy, single mothers can receive a maximum monthly allowance of\\\\xa0South Korean won 180,000 ($167), said professor Noh, but only if they meet stringent restrictions on age and income, including their family's income.  To qualify, single mothers younger than 24 must earn less than\\\\xa0South Korean won 1.71 million ($1,590) a month, and those older than that should earn less than\\\\xa0South Korean won 1.48m ($1,376). This, advocates argue, disincentivises them from working fulltime.  \\\"You can see from the system that there's an underlying judgment of unmarried mothers,\\\" said Noh, adding that for a long time there has been widespread opposition to raising the monthly allowance for fear it would encourage more out-of-wedlock births.   Wishes for the new year  The day before the New Year, Jeong, Kim and other mothers had congregated with their kids at the Seoul Youth Hostel to kick off the festivities.  Some had joined out of necessity.  \\\"Korean society does not accept us,\\\" said Dong Na-rae, a 35-year-old office manager, gesturing to her six-year-old son Yoon-joon. \\\"We didn't have anywhere else to go for the Lunar New Year, so we came here.\\\"  Others came because they prefer their KUMFA sisterhood to their biological family.  \\\"My son likes it here at the camp more than with my family,\\\" said Kim Min- seung, a 43-year-old employee at the department of education, who gave birth to Dong-hyeok on her 33rd birthday. \\\"When we go to my family for the holiday, it doesn't feel like a holiday. It's uncomfortable and awkward.\\\"  Together, the mothers and kids walked through Namsan Hanok Village. They took part in traditional Seollal games: yoonnori, played with sticks, a board and markers; and paengi, wooden tops twirled with whipcords.  They enjoyed a curry rice dinner and opened some small gifts.  All around them, the usually frenetic city was hushed - traffic tamed, pedestrians sparse and many of the shops either shuttered or posting signs listing reduced hours.  For the moms and their kids, though, their little corner of the world was a joyous racket, but they all knew that the next morning, life would go back to normal.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/27/fad1bd4b59784160a762a0eb03107138_18.jpg)  ---  Happy children during the celebrations at Namsam [Ann Babe/Al Jazeera]    ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"The stigma of being a single mother in South Korea\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/stigma-single-mother-south-korea-180226144516720.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ On February 13, 2008, the country 9s then prime minister formally apologised to generations of [Aboriginal children](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/2012716122018878595.html) who had been \\\"stolen\\\" from their families by the state in an attempt to integrate them into \\\"[white Australia](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2014/06 /immigration-nation-201461982321610712.html)\\\".

In the 70 years since its founding, the NHS, with its core value of free healthcare for all at the point of delivery, has become not only an intrinsic part of British life, but also an inspiration around the world.  But, as it struggles to cope with funding cuts and an ageing population, the future of the service, and its international reputation is uncertain.   Winters of discontent  On Wednesday, NHS England took the [unprecedented step](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/uk-nhs-delays-non-urgent- operations-winter-pressures-180104101653207.html) of suspending all non-urgent procedures until the end of January.  The move is designed to free up staff and beds to deal with emergency patients and is expected to affect around 55,000 operations such as cataracts and hip replacements.  British Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/theresa.html) apologised to patients whose operations had been postponed while visiting a hospital on Thursday.  \\\"I know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know its disappointing for people and I apologise,\\\" she said.  Healthcare staff are always under pressure in January as cold weather, flu and higher levels of respiratory illnesses put hospitals under strain.  \\\"The NHS is currently experiencing serious challenges due to peaks in demand that occur during the winter period,\\\" said Andrew Seaton, a historian of the NHS at New York University.  \\\"This has become somewhat of an annual event, though this year looks particularly serious as 21 NHS Trusts have declared a 'black alert', meaning they can no longer guarantee patient safety, nor run a full range of services,\\\" he told Al Jazeera.  This winter has seen reports of individuals waiting 12 hours to see a doctor and patients being treated in corridors.  New data released by [NHS England](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/06/nhs-england- glance-170607133653632.html) on Thursday showed a 95 percent rise in the number of patients stuck in ambulances for at least an hour during the week of December 25-31\\\\xa0- with 4,700 cases up from 2,400 the week before.

By limiting migration, the medical profession is likely to suffer and people are likely to suffer,\\\" he said.  Seaton agreed noting some of the NHS's EU and overseas workers, more than 17 percent of the service's total workforce, are leaving because of Brexit uncertainty.  \\\"The NHS has always relied on overseas workers, right back to the very beginning when it quickly began recruiting doctors and nurses from Commonwealth nations.

Iran and and world powers, including the US, signed the JCPOA in 2015 after years of diplomatic wrangling between western and Iranian diplomats.  The eventual agreement, saw Iran reduce the number of centrifuges that were capable of enriching Uranium to the levels required to produce a nuclear weapon.  In exchange, some US sanctions were lifted and frozen Iranian funds were released.  The deal was widely seen as one of Obama's most significant diplomatic achievements but tensions between Tehran and Washington remained tense. \\\\xa0  In October, Trump [refused to recertify](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/iran-nuclear-deal-donald- trump-decertifies-2015-pact-171012101055479.html) that Iran was in compliance with the agreement. The move put the onus on Congress to restore sanctions and dismantle the deal, but that did not happen. Most recently, Trump again waived Iran nuclear sanctions, vowing it would be the \\\"last time\\\" he would do so unless changes are made to the agreement.\\\\xa0  Marandi said that Trump's threat to scrap or renegotiate the deal are nothing new, and that the US had not honoured the deal under Obama.  \\\"There is a strong degree of continuity, because Trump, like Obama, violated the JCPOA repeatedly,\\\" he said referring to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over Iran's ballistic missile programme after the nuclear deal was signed.  Where Trump's threat over the nuclear deal has had an effect is on Iran's future readiness to discuss other isues with the US.  According to Marandi, a US failure to abide by the conditions set out in the JCPOA, would confirm Iranian suspicions that the US could never be relied upon to respect a deal.  \\\"Until this agreement is fully implemented, there is no way whatsoever that the Iranians are going to negotiate with the Americans over anything else.  \\\"This is a litmus test for Iran ... the very fact that the US has violated the current agreement, so repeatedly, under both administrations, shows that if the Iranians appeased the Americans and went for further talks, they would simply behave in the same way in the future.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"One year of Trump: The impact on the Middle East\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/year-trump-impact-middle-east-180118085425669.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ [Iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html) has restricted access to the Instagram and Telegram social media apps as a security measure during rare anti-government protests, according to state TV.

Saturday marked the third day of anti-government protests across Iran, when\\\\xa0[students and police](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump- warns-iran-world-watching-rare-protests-171230073658110.html)\\\\xa0clashed in Tehran.

A second [video](https://twitter.com/ICHRI/status/947148122135977984)\\\\xa0showed \\\\xa0smoke-shrouded streets, purportedly from tear gas, in the same area.  Al Jazeera could not authenticate the footage, but\\\\xa0semi-state news agency Fars also reported confrontations between police and protesters at Tehran University.  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people across Iran attended pre-planned pro- government rallies on Saturday\\\\xa0to mark the end of unrest following the country's 2009 election.  State TV aired footage showing people in several cities waving flags and carrying banners bearing the image of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The large demonstrations, which were organised weeks ago, are held every year.   'They no longer fear security forces'  Potkin Azarmehr, a blogger who focuses on the\\\\xa0secular pro-democracy struggle in Iran, told Al Jazeera that several groups have been protesting for some time \\\"and now their slogans have become more radical.\\\\xa0  \\\"They no longer seem to have that fear from security forces,\\\" he said.  Mahan Abedin, an Iran analyst at Middle East Eye, said the protests reflect the gap between ordinary Iranians and the political elite.      The protests appeared to be \\\"articulated by people who ostensibly have purely economic motives\\\", he said.  \\\"I think in keeping with longstanding culture, inevitably these protests have become political.  \\\"[President Hassan] Rouhani has the right attitude but his government riles people. This is a very elitist government, they are bureaucratic elites, technocratic elites - they are very distant from grievances of ordinary people.\\\"  Reports said activists on social media have called for a fourth day of protests on Sunday.

Although fluent in Greek, its grey-haired inhabitants share news, jokes and thoughts in their indigenous tongue: a unique variety of Arabic heavily influenced by Aramaic, the language of Jesus.  They are descendants of Christians who fled to Cyprus from modern-day Syria and Lebanon in four successive waves from the late 7th century onwards.  Less than 50 years ago, Kormakitis was home to about 2,000 people. It was the beating heart of the island's small but vibrant Maronite community.  But then in 1974, a brief Greece-backed coup prompted a military intervention by Turkish forces, which effectively divided the island between a Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south.  The Maronites, who resided in four neighbouring northern villages, suddenly found themselves in the middle of an ethnic conflict that would have a devastating effect on their community.  Their ancestral villages, which had for centuries shielded their culture and customs, were instantly seized by the Turkish army. Overnight, about 80 percent of Cyprus' Maronites were uprooted, seeking shelter in the Greek- speaking south.  But in Kormakitis, the largest of the villages, hundreds opted to stay behind.  They were unharmed by the fighting, but life became increasingly difficult. With work opportunities shrinking and the village's only school shut, many - especially the youth - felt they had no choice but to leave Kormakitis for the more affluent south.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/9a328608c4174fccb60be69ec39f9291_18.jpg)  ---  Kormakitis is home today to about 100 year-round residents [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     Yet for some, abandoning Kormakitis was never an option.  \\\"Where could I have gone?\\\" Skordis asks, without waiting for an answer. \\\"This is where my father was born and died; my mother and siblings, too. I've been a farmer all my life and everything I've done, I've done it here.\\\"  In the end, some 120 Maronites remained \\\"enclaved\\\" in Kormakitis, living north of a United Nations-controlled no-man's land dividing the Mediterranean island.  For decades, before the easing of border restrictions in 2003, the villagers would need to secure special permission to see their displaced loved ones in person. Contact was brief and sporadic.  \\\"Life was lonely,\\\" recalls 71-year-old Annetta Maurohanna, who has been working at the cafe by the imposing St George Cathedral in the heart of Kormakitis for the past 30 years.  \\\"But I didn't want to leave,\\\" she adds. \\\"Everyone craves to be at home.\\\"  Each week, a UN truck would visit the largely cut off villagers to deliver foodstuffs, medicine and other vital supplies.  \\\"You'd have to have been here to be able to understand the hardship that we went through,\\\" says Skordis, a father of six, pausing to hold back tears.  \\\"Three of my daughters sent me messages before their weddings saying they didn't have any money to get married - and I couldn't send them any,\\\" he continues. \\\"We suffered a lot, and that's why we now avoid remembering those times, so we don't get upset.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/58baf2be34a4493795dfeba964c1c869_18.jpg)  ---  Kormakitis resident Annetta Maurohanna, 71: \\\"My village means everything to me - all my life, all my memories\\\" [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     Today, the island's Maronites number an estimated 6,000 people.  They are scattered across southern towns and villages, bar the band of elderly farmers, herdsmen and pensioners residing in Kormakitis and a handful of families living in Karpasha, further southeast.  Two other nearby Maronite villages - Asomatos and Ayia Marina (a previously mixed Maronite and Turkish Cypriot village) - are empty of their residents and now used by the Turkish army as military bases.\\\\xa0  About half of the Maronite population is believed to trace its roots back to Kormakitis, and the vast majority of them have been allowed to repair their previously deserted houses. Its residents have ownership rights and can also sell or rent their land, as well as inherit it, but subject to specific conditions.\\\\xa0  The village comes alive again on weekends and holidays, its square filled with children and its cafes and tavernas overflowing with patrons.  The school remains shut, but in the summer children here attend short language camps to learn Cypriot Maronite Arabic (CMA), referred to locally as Sanna.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/13/fae5fb08ebfa45188f024c0943162715_8.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     Passed down from generation to generation through everyday conversation, the centuries-old CMA is a variant of Arabic that's rooted in Aramaic but has taken words from Greek, Turkish and Latin.  It is classified as a \\\"seriously endangered\\\" language by the Council of Europe, while 10 years ago experts created a written alphabet with the aim of codifying and preserving it.  Mysteriously, the ancient dialect is only spoken by Kormakitis natives and not by any others Maronites from the community's other remaining villages. Until 1974, children in Kormakitis would only begin learning Greek in the first grade.  \\\"Currently, about 1,000 people speak our language, but they're all aged over 40 and 50,\\\" says Mihalis Hadjiroussos, chairman of the Xki Fi Sanna NGO.  The group, whose name translates to \\\"Speak Our Language\\\", was set up more than a decade ago to protect and promote CMA through summer camps, afternoon lessons and cultural activities.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/9271898286314e6ca8191ec2cb5639a1_18.jpg)  ---  Mihalis Hadjiroussos, 70: \\\"Cyprus is our homeland and Lebanon is our second homeland\\\" [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     But such revival efforts don't go very far.  Following international pressure, the Cypriot government in 2008 recognised CMA as a minority language, but it did not formally incorporate it into the education system.  That means that summer camps and afternoon classes aside, many younger Maronites see little use in learning a moribund language - distancing themselves further from their endangered community's identity.  \\\"Our chance to survive as a community, and to save our language, is to go back to our villages,\\\" says Hadjiroussos, 70, sitting around other elderly Maronites in their community's club in Nicosia, Cyprus's capital.  \\\"If 2,000 people go back to the village and stay there then the right conditions will be created for people to speak the language - and for weddings between people from the village to take place.\\\"  That's at the heart of Maronites' fears over their community's looming extinction.  Dispersed among Greek Cypriots and away from their parents' villages, the overwhelming majority of Maronites - an estimated nine out of 10 - marry outside their community.  Giorgos Skordis, a 47-year-old actuary, is a rare exception. His wife, Antoinetta, was the last person to be born in Kormakitis, while the couple's wedding in 2008 was the first in the village after 1974.  \\\"The community has been almost fully assimilated,\\\" says Skordis, in a cafe in Nicosia.  \\\"Many, perhaps even most [Maronites], have started feeling like Greeks. Even though they came from Lebanon, spoke Arabic and ethnically they're not Greeks - owing to their schooling, mixed weddings and displacement,\\\" he explains.  \\\"And the ones who don't feel like that, they're forced to, in a way, because their children and their grandchildren are Greek Cypriots.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/4fb0d845364d47529299552a37ba9f5a_18.jpg)  ---  The \\\"Kormakitis\\\" cafe is a regular meeting spot for Maronites in Nicosia [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     Cyprus is home to one of the world's longest-running frozen conflicts.  Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders have long worked towards a deal to reunify the island, but several UN-mediated attempts to reach an agreement have collapsed, often in mutual recrimination, insults and anger.  Amid the charged and pervasive reality of a divided Cyprus, smaller communities such as the Maronites feel trapped between two fronts.  \\\"Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have massive differences, and we are the victims of that,\\\" says Haji Roussos.  He should know.  As a non-voting representative of the Maronite community in Cyprus's House of Representatives for 20 years, Haji Roussos experienced marginalisation first- hand.  \\\"I once met the US ambassador and told him that, 'We won't be able to survive without support,'\\\" Haji Roussos says. \\\"He responded, 'I realise this,\\\\xa0you are like the ball in a ping pong match being hit around, but we can't do anything about it.'\\\"  Under the Republic of Cyprus Constitution of 1960, the Maronite community is recognised as a \\\"religious group\\\" but not a minority.  Haji Roussos and others have long campaigned for the change of the community's status - but to no avail.  \\\"Although there was goodwill on behalf of the [Greek Cypriot] government and the parliament, but they used the argument that they couldn't change the Constitution,\\\" he says.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/bbe769d4cdba4988a6799e5df35cd9e6_18.jpg)  ---  Antonis Haji Roussos, ex-Maronite representative in Greek Cypriot parliament [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     At independence in 1960, Cyprus's bicommunal constitution arranged for a Greek Cypriot president and Turkish Cypriot deputy, in a power-sharing agreement that was short-lived.  Solely identified as a \\\"religious group\\\", the island's Maronites, Armenians and Latins were asked to choose which of the two largest communities to join and all three opted to be identified as Greek Cypriots due to religious affinity and linguistic and cultural bonds - adding yet another layer to the island's complex reality.  \\\"The Cyprus problem is presented as simply a Greek-Turkish problem, which results in all other important matters being ignored and side-stepped,\\\" says Costas Constantinou, a professor of international relations at the University of Cyprus.  \\\"There is assimilation, while others say that the Cyprus problem shouldn't be complicated any further by also looking at the issues of minority groups,\\\" he adds.  Last summer, Turkish Cypriot leaders announced that a plan would be presented about the opening up of the rest of Maronite villages to their former inhabitants and the completion of infrastructure work to make resettlement possible.  Not much has since happened, but the Greek Cypriot side at the time rejected the move, calling it \\\"communications tricks\\\" and\\\\xa0part of a plan to not place such villages under Greek Cypriot administration after a solution to the island's division is reached.  Back in Kormakitis, Maurohanna, the cafe server who has known no other home than this village, said time is of the essence.  \\\"We sacrificed ourselves and we managed to keep our villages,\\\" she says.  \\\"But if no people return, everything will cease to exist.  \\\"This is what we want: a peaceful resolution to the Cyprus problem and everybody to come back.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/d13a81ebe7fe4395a86f4ba93e728718_18.jpg)  ---  The interior of St George Cathedral in Kormakitis [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]    ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Cypriot Maronites: Ancient community facing extinction\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/cypriot-maronites-ancient-community-facing-extinction-180212173312467.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Emmerson Bockarie,\\\\xa0Sierra Leonean musician, laughs a lot for someone who receives personal insults from the president and anonymous death threats with the release of every new single.  A thorn in the side of successive governments over his 15-year career,\\\\xa0Bockarie chuckles as he recalls\\\\xa0the countless times politicians have sought to dampen his appeal, and the\\\\xa0countless times they have failed.  \\\"Politicians make mentions of my music on TV and radio. That means they hear the songs and are getting the message,\\\" he notes with delight, settling down for an interview with AFP at his Freetown studio.  Better known simply as \\\"Emmerson\\\", the Afrobeat singer is the bete noire of Sierra Leone's music scene, one of few successful artists who refuse to play political rallies or back a party in a nation where rappers and singers are co-opted for their youth appeal.  With a new president due to be elected on Tuesday, Emmerson\\\\xa0Bockarie says he expects fresh inspiration for his soft yet scathing lyrics - whoever wins - as the ruling All Peoples' Congress (APC) faces off against the main opposition Sierra Leone Peoples' Party (SLPP).  The two parties have ruled the country alternately since independence in 1961.  \\\"I stand with the people; I am with the country,\\\" he enthuses. \\\"It makes no sense for me to belong to a political party.\\\"  Consistent criticism  Emmerson began making music in the local Krio language after [Sierra Leone](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/sierra-leone.html)'s civil war ended in 2002, when he had just left school.  His first single \\\"Yu Go See Am\\\" ridiculed government officials stuffing their faces and skimming money off state funds while ordinary citizens went hungry.  \\\"The (then) president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, was like: it's better for them to sing than to go back to the bush and be rebels,\\\" he explains, referring to the legions of child and youth soldiers.  These days, he is heavily engaged in civic education, collaborating with four other artists on the song \\\"Mi vote na mi life\\\" last year to encourage voters deeply split along tribal and regional lines to consider policies when making their choice.  \\\"Emmerson songs are about issues affecting ordinary people,\\\" explained Murtala Mohamed Kamara, publisher of entertainment publication the Salone Jamboree.  \\\"He has been consistent with his criticism and advocacy for change without bias to any government,\\\" he added.   'No easy eh'  A typical Emmerson song will encompass mockery of politicians' greed and uselessness, tributes to Sierra Leone and its long-suffering people, and some element of hope for the future.  His lyrics about poverty - \\\"wi weh no born mit money/ less opportunity/ still wi wan be somebody/ e no easy eh\\\" - reflect the frustrations of young people in a country with high unemployment and enduring social injustice.  \\\"I started listening to Emmerson's music in 2007, and I still love him for telling the truth,\\\" fan Ophaniel Gooding told AFP.  But his riotously successful songs have made him some powerful enemies.  \\\"I know there are propaganda machines out there organised by the government to go against my music on social media,\\\" Emmerson says.  \\\"Sometimes you have phone calls, text messages, Facebook... 'We will light you up. If I ever see you that will be your last day'.\\\" he adds, eyes widening beneath the brim of a baseball cap.  And that is before his much-publicised war of words with outgoing President Ernest Bai Koroma, who is accused of failing to address corruption and the economic fallout of the 2014-16 Ebola crisis.  \\\"The president referred to me as a fly, that he would just blow me off,\\\" Emmerson laughs, with a mock dismissive flick of the hand.  Emmerson got his revenge by sampling a soundbite of Koroma's hand-picked successor, Samura Kamara, in the opening strains of his election-inspired hit, Good Do.  The former foreign minister admitted during a February campaign debate that the ruling party was responsible for the deplorable conditions in some parts of the country.  \\\"I blame the government,\\\" Kamara is heard admitting before Emmerson is recorded laughing over the presidential candidate's words.   'My fight'  The singer sincerely believes he provides an information service for citizens, the majority of whom are illiterate and only hear government \\\"lies\\\" from TV and radio.  But the fierce pride of his fans takes a toll. He is separated from his wife, blaming the all-consuming nature of his music, and admits he has \\\"no time\\\" for himself.  \\\"Whatever happens in the country, people go 'Emmerson!' They go: 'where's Emmerson?' Am I a village, a town crier?\\\" he asks, smiling with just a hint of irritation.  Technology has also complicated his life. Previously he relied on CD and cassette sales to make money, and although YouTube and iTunes have given him a global reach, locals are now more likely to pirate his music.  He is currently concentrating his energies on a label, Sugar Entertainment, that is nurturing a new generation of artists.  But what motivates him on a daily basis is his \\\"dream\\\" for Sierra Leone, for a nation free of injustice and ethnic conflict, with jobs for everyone and a freer political system.  But he will never be the one to lead his people to this brighter future.  If I go into politics, who would be doing what I'm doing? We need me,\\\" he said. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Emmerson: The pop star challenging Sierra Leone's presidents\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/emmerson-pop-star-challenging-sierra-leone-presidents-180327103105289.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Six [Native American](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/native- americans.html) tribes in the US state of Virginia have been granted full federal recognition after a nearly twenty-year-long legal fight.
