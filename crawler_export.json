      "article": "[ WASHINGTON 4 Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [had ](https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27/asm-unanimously-approves- contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions-from- campus/)[gathered](https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27/asm-unanimously- approves-contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions-from-campus/)[ last spring to consider a resolution](https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27 /asm-unanimously-approves-contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions- from-campus/) calling on the university to divest in companies and countries that abuse human rights, profit from the cmilitary-industrial complex and promote fossil fuels when the debate jumped the rails. , Soon, the students were in a full-scale battle over whether the resolution should cover Israel, with charges of anti-Semitism and racism rattling the room. A student representative who was Jewish said that the last-minute inclusion of Israel ccrossed the line from legitimate conversation to a point where I consider it malicious. The student government chairwoman, who is black, suggested the opposition to the resolution amounted to cwhite supremacy, which she condemned with a four-letter expletive. , In the aftermath, Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, decided to enter the fray, [writing](http://brandeiscenter.com/ldb-urges-further-action-from-uw-madison/) to university administrators to denounce calls for divestment from Israel as anti-Semitic, and to assail the meeting as hostile toward Jewish students. He urged that the black student leader be disciplined. , On Thursday, Mr. Marcus received the approval of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to be President Trump 9s assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department, a prestigious post known more for policing racial bias and sexual violence in schools than refereeing the battles over Israel and Palestinian rights on the nation 9s university campuses. , Mr. Marcus 9s support for Jewish students has earned him praise in some quarters as an ardent defender of civil liberties with an acumen for the rule of law. On campus after campus, the B.D.S. movement 4 Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel 4 has driven a wedge between Jewish students and students of color, challenging university administrations and straining the traditional bonds between Jews and other minorities. And Mr. Marcus has not been shy in choosing sides. , Critics see him as a biased crusader whose singular focus on what he believes to be rising anti-Semitism on the campus left will further impede the Education Department 9s already tentative efforts to enforce civil rights protections for marginalized groups of students. ,  cWhat I find particularly troubling is he condemned a black woman on a predominantly white campus for pointing out my oppression, said Carmen Gosey, who was chairwoman of the Associated Students of Madison, the Wisconsin student government, at the time of the battle there last year. , His approach to the debate at the university cshows he doesn 9t understand racism, or he has an issue with black people talking about issues, or anyone who isn 9t Jewish talking about their issues, which seems very problematic for someone who is going to be in charge of civil rights, she said. , Ariela Rivkin, the Jewish student representative on the council, disagreed. She and other students felt targeted by Ms. Gosey 9s comments and believed she allowed the divestment legislation to be organized on the Jewish holiday of Passover, which they considered harassing and exclusionary. , Mr. Marcus 9s intervention cmeant everything to me, said Ms. Rivkin, who strongly backed Mr. Marcus 9s nomination to head the Education Department 9s civil rights office. cWhoever is in that role should be able to recognize that I have a right to express myself in a hostile-free environment. , For his part, Mr. Marcus, a career civil liberties lawyer, says he would show no bias in his approach to civil rights enforcement. During his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Marcus said he could cthink of no higher calling than to enforce the principles of equal justice and provide greater opportunities for students across this great country. , Mr. Marcus was delegated the authority of assistant secretary for civil rights for two years in the Bush administration where he reinforced protections for women and Jews as well as Muslims and Sikhs who faced religious discrimination in the wake of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. , If confirmed by the full Senate, Mr. Marcus would return to the high-profile office at a turbulent time. Issues of race, religion, sexual identity and freedom of speech are roiling elementary, secondary and higher education. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is under fire for Mr. Trump 9s attitudes toward and treatment of immigrants and minority groups, and her own [re- examination of Obama-era rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos- colleges-sex-assault.html) to protect against sexual assault and race discrimination in special education placements is controversial. ,  cTo me, he is more dangerous than she is, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, one of the many human rights groups opposing Mr. Marcus 9s nomination. cHe is infinitely more effective. , Mr. Marcus served in both the housing and education departments under Mr. Bush and as staff director for the bipartisan United States Commission on Civil Rights, positions that his supporters say have afforded him the skills to combat the most intractable civil rights challenges. ,  cHe has a real good understanding about how all of our rights as Americans fit together, so he 9s not one-dimensional in any way, said Jennifer C. Braceras, a former member of the commission. , His critics question whether he will fulfill the office 9s goal to stand up for all students. More than 30 civil rights organizations [wrote a letter ](https://civilrights.org/oppose-confirmation-kenneth-marcus-assistant- secretary-civil-rights/)to the Senate Education Committee urging his rejection. , The groups cited Mr. Marcus 9s record of rejecting policies that address discrimination against minority groups, including affirmative action and the evidence that minority students are more likely to face tough disciplinary actions. The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund said Mr. Marcus was cunlikely to advance diversity and equal access to educational resources. , [During his confirmation hearing last month](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marcus1.pdf), Mr. Marcus said that he believed that if disproportionately high numbers of black students were being disciplined it would be grounds for concern, though it would not indicate outright discrimination or set off a systemic investigation. Ms. DeVos 9s administration has been criticized for taking a similar approach to all civil rights enforcement. ,  cMy experience says one needs to approach each complaint or compliance review with an open mind and sense of fairness to find out what the answers are, Mr. Marcus told the committee. cI have seen what appear to be inexcusable disparities that were result of paperwork errors. , The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights also questioned his support for Ms. DeVos 9s decision to rescind Obama-era guidance that strengthened processes for investigating sexual assault on college campuses. Ms. DeVos has expressed concern that the guidance has unfairly affected those accused of misconduct. , But Mr. Marcus has garnered support from conservative civil liberties groups that believe that he will rein in what they see as an overreach of civil rights enforcement during the Obama administration. , Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, said that under the Obama administration, affirmative action morphed into cracial preference. To extend legal protection to cover gender identity and sexual orientation, he said, is csimply not good law. ,  cThe civil rights laws say and mean something different than what was interpreted by the Obama administration, and I think that will change, Mr. Clegg said. cI think Ken is more in line with our interpretation of things. , Human rights groups also expressed concern that Mr. Marcus will use his office to further a more narrow agenda: combating the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement on college campuses, which he believes has devolved into violent, anti-Semitic harassment. , From his perch at the Brandeis Center, he has filed anti-Semitic harassment complaints with the Office for Civil Rights against three University of California college campuses, and encouraged Jewish students and their supporters to do the same. , Mr. Marcus [wrote](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Standing- up-for-Jewish-students-325648) in an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post that while the complaints were rejected, they had created public relations headaches for the institutions. ,  cIf a university shows a failure to treat initial complaints seriously, it hurts them with donors, faculty, political leaders and prospective students, Mr. Marcus wrote. , In its opposition, the Leadership Conference said that Mr. Marcus csought to use the Office of Civil Rights complaint process to chill a particular point of view, rather than address unlawful discrimination. , Mr. Marcus has lobbied for institutions and the Education Department to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism that Jewish activists embrace but that many Palestinian rights groups say would render criticism of Israel as hate speech. Mr. Marcus has also said that Middle East programs accused of an anti-Israel agenda should lose federal funding. ,  cHis primary mission is not to support students 9 civil rights; it 9s to protect Israel from criticism, said Rahul Saksena, an attorney with Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights group. , A group of 60 religious and educational organizations disagreed. They point to instances where Mr. Marcus has litigated First Amendment cases. ,  cWhile some believe that preventing discrimination in education and protecting the First Amendment are at odds, we could not disagree more. Both principles are paramount, wrote the group, which included Christian groups, Students and Parents Against Campus Anti-Semitism, and Stop BDS on Campus. , Mr. Marcus 9s support from conservative Christians extends beyond their broad backing of Israel. In 1998, Mr. Marcus spoke at a Traditional Values Coalition conference, where he criticized hate crimes legislation that would cover violence based on sexual orientation. He described the legislation as cgiving preferred treatment of some sorts of victims over other sorts of victims, and punishing people for cunpopular and ctraditionalist views. ,  cThere are people who are using the word 8hate 9 to denigrate some traditional moral values, [Mr. Marcus told the group.](https://www.c-span.org/video/?103282-1/homosexuality-public-policy) , In response to more than 50 questions from Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Marcus said that his views expressed at the Traditional Values conference had cevolved. ] ",

      "article": "[  **GREEN**  By Sam Graham-Felsen  301 pp. Random House. $27. ,  cGreen, the debut novel from Sam Graham-Felsen, who was chief blogger for Barack Obama 9s 2008 presidential campaign, chronicles the middle school travails of an anomalous variety of minority student. cI am the white boy at the Martin Luther King Middle, is how 12-year-old David Alexander Greenfeld, nicknamed Green, introduces himself in the novel 9s opening line. Martin Luther King Middle is a Boston public school 4 cmad ghetto, in Green 9s estimation 4 where his progressive parents have sent him for sixth grade. He 9s not the only white boy in the school, but the other one 4 his friend Kev, who 9s got lip scruff and spiky black hair along with prowess on the basketball court 4 often passes for Puerto Rican. There 9s no mistaking Green, though: not with his blue eyes and blond curls and constantly flushed cheeks, not with his monogrammed L. L. Bean backpack, not with his weakness for blurting the word cawesome ( ca Caucasian catastrophe, he notes). Almost all 12-year-olds are confused about who and what they are, but for David Greenfeld, at school, one conspicuous facet of his identity defines him: not his Green-ness, but his whiteness. , Hewing to the classic coming-of-age-novel formula, cGreen 9s Green experiences a variety of awakenings 4 sexual, religious, familial, moral and not surprisingly racial 4 during the course of his sixth-grade school year (1992-93), all of which get relayed in first-person, present- tense, slanged-up narration. The alarm clock for some of these awakenings is the friendship Green strikes with Marlon Wellings, a pious, studious black classmate who lives near Green in the Robert Gould Shaw Homes, a.k.a. cthe projects. Marlon, unlike Green, is mostly immune to social tensions, sitting by himself at lunchtime studying for the entrance exam to Boston Latin, the city 9s elite public school, where Green also aims to transfer. Green 9s first impression is that Marlon clooks pretty soft, and thus approachable: ccreased khakis, pilled-up flannel, boxy black shoes and a short, unkempt flattop, more like a clumpy cloud. He has a gap in his front teeth, just as Green does, but the similarities don 9t end there. The bond they form is based partly upon a clandestine love for the Boston Celtics 4 cno one openly admits they feel the Celtics anymore, Green says 4 and partly upon their shared desire for an upward move to Boston Latin. At Martin Luther King Middle they 9re outsiders, and both of them are desperate to get even farther outside. , The similarities do, however, bear some obvious endpoints. Green 9s Birkenstock-shod parents went to Harvard before embarking on a life of bobo activism ( cPops gives mad loot to Greenpeace d); Marlon 9s father is somewhere down South while his grandmother cares for him along with his mentally ill mother. Green and his 8-year-old brother, Benno, spend summers helping their parents tend a community garden plot; Marlon eats asparagus for the first time at Green 9s house and the resultant urine smell triggers a cancer panic. Green is a secular Jew, confounded by what that even means, while Marlon sings in the choir in a storefront church near the Roxbury border. Green 9s parents, if they would relax their principles, could conceivably send him to a safer private school (brother Benno, who recently stopped speaking, attends one such school cfor sensitive kids d); Marlon 9s grandmother is absent that option. And Marlon is black, while Green, glaringly, is white. , This dynamic 4 the white boy adrift in the urban and predominantly black school, the fraught cross-racial friendship that blooms there 4 isn 9t new to fiction. Jonathan Lethem probed it, with exquisite grace, in his 2003 novel cThe Fortress of Solitude. (A line from Lethem 9s novel, in fact, could serve as a 10-word summary of Green: cA white boy in sixth grade, squirming in the glare. d) Graham-Felsen isn 9t reaching for the same lofty heights as Lethem did (few novelists dare to), but he is reaching in the same general direction: toward the terribly thorny beauty at the heart of cross-racial friendships, which constitutes, per Leslie Fiedler and others, one of our essential American stories. These thorns keep getting denser and sharper as cGreen progresses, as when Green discovers that the pair 9s snow shoveling business is successful only when he approaches potential customers without Marlon in sight. What we call racism Green apprehends as cthe force d: its energies everywhere, cworking on everyone, himself included. When Green copies a couple of answers from Marlon during the fated entrance exam, the white proctor takes notice but lets it slide. cA sickening mix of relief and shame sweeps over me, says Green. cMar knows it and I do, too: I 9ve been saved by the force. , Moments like these 4 rendered subtly, without poster-size messaging 4 are when cGreen is at its most prickly and compelling. Scenes of innocence 4 Green and Marlon clowning in homemade pro-wrestler costumes, or watching VHS tapes of Larry Bird-era Celtics games from inside a living room fort made of blankets and chairs 4 serve as their delicately calibrated counterbalances, affecting in their sweetness but credible in their lack of saccharine. Graham-Felsen lets boys be boys: messy-brained, impulsive, goatish, self-centered, outwardly gutsy but often inwardly terrified. The voice with which Graham-Felsen equips Green, overseasoned with hip-hop slang, is the epitome of this. At first blush it suggests Holden Caulfield as translated by Vanilla Ice ( cIf I 9m gonna make another attempt to kick it to her, I 9m gonna need a new Machine, and for that I 9m gonna need to fatten my muenster stack, fast d). Yet as the novel advances, and this street stud pose starts splintering, the voice itself gathers a kind of dorky poignancy, the reader sensing an unseen wobble upon Green 9s stiff, pale lip. Is it linguistic blackface, with all that implies, or a 12-year- old 9s guileless attempt to cobble together a voice of his own from what 9s nearest at hand? cI wish I had what he has, Green says of Marlon at one point. He 9s talking about religion, but it could be identity or maybe identity 9s midwife, community. cAll I came up with was confusion. , Yet this reader found himself wishing for something of Marlon 9s, too: _his_ awakenings, _his_ perspective, _his_ inner voice, _his_ fullness on the page. As Lethem wrote in cThe Fortress of Solitude d: cThe white kid has one set of feelings, the black kid another. That we aren 9t privy to those feelings owes less to malpractice than to the inherent limitations of Graham-Felsen telling this story through Green 9s blue eyes. Marlon only exists within Green 9s purview, which means that cGreen 4 and by extension the reader 4 sees only a fraction of the whole. cWe match up in a million soft little ways 4 why can 9t we just be boys again? Green laments near the end, when the friendship has run aground. cBut the more I think about it, the more I wonder if we were meant to be shards from the start. Not just me and Mar 4 everyone. Look around. \\u2026 The force is everywhere, prying us apart. There 9s more hopefulness than this by the final pages, but it 9s a long-shot hope, a coin into a fountain. He and Marlon match up in a million ways save one, but that one, in America then as now, seems cursed to outweigh all the others. ] ",

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News) Virtually nowhere in the United States do black boys grow up to earn incomes equivalent to white boys raised in the same neighborhoods by parents with comparable wealth and education levels, according to a [study released Monday](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/) that followed millions of children now in their late 30s or turning 40.\\xa0 The disparity holds true even for black boys raised in the wealthiest of families, who grew up on the same block in the same affluent community and attended the same school as their white counterparts. The findings shows that race -- not just parental income or neighborhood opportunities -- factors into the [yawning wealth gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and- hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind- whites/?utm_term=.39a115133188) between blacks and whites in America. In addition to income, black boys were more likely to be incarcerated and less likely to attend college than their white counterparts from families of similar income level.  cRace matters, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist who co- authored\\xa0the paper with Raj Chetty at Stanford and two researchers with the U.S. Census Bureau. cParent income and neighborhoods cannot explain the entirety of the black-white gap. Even when your parents get rich, the gaps don 9t go away. The gap actually increased at the upper end of the income spectrum, a finding that surprised the researchers. In 99 percent of U.S. Census tracts, white boys grew up to earn more than black boys. The average gap for individual wages was about $9,000 for men from low-income families, Hendren said. That gap widened to an average of roughly $11,000 for men from affluent families. Among the wealthiest families, black sons of millionaires typically earned an individual annual income of between $40,000 and $45,000 at age 35, while white sons of millionaires earned between $50,000 and $55,000, Hendren said. The household income gap was wider and was largely explained by the higher marriage rates among whites, he said.  cThe racial divide is something that permeates the backyards of every community in America, in both affluent and poorer neighborhoods, Hendren said. cIn fact, the gap is even larger in affluent neighborhoods with better schools. The income disparity was driven entirely by men, researchers found -- with the gap virtually erased for women raised by parents of similar income levels. Black and white women with comparable family backgrounds grew up to attend college at near identical levels, worked similar hours, and earned closely equivalent wages. Both black and white daughters of millionaires earned an average of around $38,500 a year at age 35. Boys born into high-income black families were much more likely to experience downward economic mobility than similarly situated whites across generations, the study said. A black child born to parents in the top 20th percentile of the income distribution was as likely to fall to the bottom quintile as he was to remain in the top. But white boys\\xa0were\\xa0nearly five times as likely to remain in the top quintile as they were to fall to the bottom. As for what accounts for the disparities in upward mobility, the researchers do not have a clear answer. Social scientists and policy makers have suggested better educational opportunities, even marriage, as the key. But neither explains the intergenerational income gap between black and white children from similar backgrounds. In the neighborhoods with low poverty rates where the gap is smallest, researchers identified two common traits: black fathers were more likely to be present in the communities and racial bias among whites, as measured by online psychological tests, was lower. The presence of black fathers predicted the outcome of black boys regardless of whether a boy 9s own father was present. But less than 5 percent of black children grow up in low-poverty environments with more than half of black fathers present, the study found, whereas 63 percent of white children are raised in communities with a high presence of white fathers. Researchers suggested several policy considerations to close the intergenerational gap, including moving black families to better neighborhoods or replicating those conditions across the country with mentoring programs for black boys and efforts to reduce racial bias among whites. The study relied upon newly available longitudinal Census data covering nearly the entire U.S. population between 1989 and 2015 as well as federal tax returns. Researchers followed a cohort of 20 million children born in the U.S. between 1978 and 1983 or legal immigrants who came to the country as children. ] ",

      "article": "[ Want to witness the tectonic shifts underway in American politics? Consider women and college graduates, who have flocked to the Democratic Party in recent years. , A larger share of college graduates identify as or lean Democratic than at any point in the past quarter-century, according to [a new Pew Research Center report](http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing- educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/) based on more than 10,000 interviews with registered voters last year. The data tell a similar story for women, too. , Republicans have gained some ground, too, among older registered voters and those with a high school education or less. , Here 9s a brief look at the findings of the Pew analysis, which was released this week. , Americans are more divided along educational lines than at any point in about a quarter-century, according to Pew. , That 9s thanks largely to a realignment among two groups: those with only a high school diploma and those who have completed college. , In 1992, 55 percent of registered voters with no more than a high school education identified or leaned toward the Democratic Party, while only 37 percent sided with Republicans. Today, the group shows a slight preference for the Republican Party. , The exact opposite is true for Americans with at least a college degree, whose slight preference for Republicans in 1992 has since flipped. Today, about 58 percent side with Democrats, and only 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party. , That divergence was most pronounced among registered voters who had pursued a postgraduate education: Once split in their political preferences, they are now twice as likely to align with Democrats as with Republicans. , Women have long been more likely to side with the Democratic Party than with Republicans, but the gap in preference expanded in recent years, to 19 percentage points in 2017 from 12 points in 2015. , Most of that growth, however, comes not from women who now identify as Democrats, but those who find themselves leaning toward the party, according to Pew. , And the gap is widest among millennial women, who are three times as likely to identify or lean Democratic as Republican: In 2017, 70 percent of millennial women sided with Democrats, while just 23 percent preferred Republicans. , That gap is more than two times as large as it was in 2014. , But not all women have moved toward the Democrats. Support for Republicans has steadily risen among women in the Silent Generation, defined by Pew as those born from 1928 to 1945. Today, 48 percent of those women side with Republicans, while 46 percent align with Democrats. ] ",

Some companies will have some of their data, such as the payroll, on one system and other data on different systems. However, everyone has to get on and do this.\" A Government Equalities Office spokesman said the department would be following up with employers where \"statistically improbable data has been reported\" to help them get it right. He added: \"Employers have until 4 April 2018, or 30 March 2018 for the public sector, to report their gender pay gap. They must also ensure that the information they publish is accurate. This is not an option, it is the law, so they need to get on and do it. \"Any evidence that employers are breaching the law can be investigated and they risk being subject to enforcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.\" The employer to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% gap between male and female staff.   Phase Eight said the figure did not reflect the \"true story\" of the business as most male employees are in higher-paid head office roles rather than in shops. The pay gap is calculated based on the difference in the mean hourly rate earned by male and female staff.  ] ",

So what are states doing? Are they taking advantage of that flexibility to back away from the worst parts of No Child Left Behind? Each state plan must be approved by the U.S. Education Department, and so far 33 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have seen their blueprints approved. Democrats in the Senate have expressed concern about the approvals, saying that the department is giving states a pass to do what they what 4 regardless of whether the accountability plans comply with ESSA. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), head of the Senate Education Committee, has praised the department in this regard. In this post, Monty Neill, executive director of the [National Center for Fair & Open Testing](http://www.fairtest.org), a nonprofit group\\xa0known as FairTest that works to end the abuse of standardized tests, analyzes the first 16 state plans that were approved by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. _[[ Efforts to reduce standardized testing succeeded in many school districts in 2017. Here 9s why and how. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/06/efforts-to-reduce-standardized-testing-succeeded- in-many-school-districts-in-2017-heres-why-and-how/?utm_term=.6aa8dc282d94)]_ _**By Monty Neill**_ Have states taken advantage of the new federal education law 9s flexibility on accountability to overcome the destructive legacy of No Child Left Behind (NCLB)? A just-completed review of the first 16 approved state Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plans by the [National Center for Fair & Open Testing ](http://www.fairtest.org)shows limited progress. Most positively, 10 of the 16 states abandoned NCLB 9s failed test-and- punish policies, such as firing staff or closing or privatizing schools for low standardized exam scores. On the other hand, states have not taken sufficient advantage of ESSA 9s opportunities to improve assessment and accountability. If every state adopted the best practices pioneered by some jurisdictions, U.S. public schools could make faster progress toward developing helpful, not harmful, accountability systems. The FairTest analysis examined five basic components of state ESSA plans and considered three other related issues. You can find additional detail and recommendations in our report and state-by-state chart, [available here](http://fairtest.org/State-ESSA-Plans-Report-2018) and below. Here are findings from a review of these states: Arizona, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont. 1) **_States have selected a narrow range of school quality/student success indicators, many of which are standardized test scores._** _States should develop a richer array of indicators_. A few states include factors such as adequate funding, school climate, student or parent engagement, reductions in punitive discipline, access to a well-rounded curriculum, and access to resources such as counselors, librarians and wraparound services for students and families. 2) **_Most states give much less weight to school quality/student success than they should_. ** Combined with the narrow range of indicators, this means states remain too heavily focused on reading/English language arts and math test scores. As a result, schools will continue to feel pressure to focus on test preparation, to the detriment of a richer education. _States should increase the weight of school quality/student success indicators,_ such as those listed above, to at least 40 percent, as a few states have done, in addition to broadening the indicators. (ESSA requires that non-school quality/student success indicators should have csignificantly greater weighting than school quality/student success indicators.) 3)\\xa0 ** _Many states have created school ranking categories or levels beyond the three required by ESSA._** The required categories are schools in need of comprehensive (schoolwide) support and improvement (CSI), those in need of targeted (to groups of students) support and improvement (TSI), and all others. Of the 16 states, six require only three levels, three have four levels, and six use five levels. (Most states using five levels rank schools with a letter grade of A through F.) Levels will perpetuate unhealthy competition because the primary factor for determining a school 9s level remains standardized tests. Schools may focus narrowly on boosting test scores to cbeat other schools, thereby undermining a richer curriculum. _States with more than three levels should cut back to just three._ 4) **_Six of the 16 states retain some of NCLB 9s punitive sanctions_ , **though most of them do so only if initial improvement efforts have not succeeded after about three years 4 which is too short a time span. The remaining 10 states plan to provide assistance to struggling schools. If that is unsuccessful, they will increase the assistance, rather than impose punishments, as NCLB required. **_This is the most positive finding from FairTest 9s review_.** _States should abandon punitive NCLB mandates._ If after six years serious problems remain, states should determine why they persist and intervene appropriately. 5) **_Some states attach punitive consequences to ESSA 9s requirement that schools test 95 percent of their students with federally mandated state exams._** The U.S. Department of Education expects states to factor participation into state plans and school ratings. This means a good school could be put in a lower level, even identified at different levels of needing improvement (CSI or TSI), if more than 5 percent of students opt out of testing. Further, 14 of the 16 states mandate additional actions. In eight, it means only a plan to improve participation or some unspecified intervention. But in six the state will do such things as lower a school 9s ranking by a level, even if it has already dropped once due to insufficient participation. _This goes beyond ESSA requirements and punishes schools for the actions of parents._ _States should do no more than report the 95 percent participation rate._ They should not penalize schools placed in lower levels because of opt-out percentages. Louisiana plans no further actions. New York and New Jersey will calculate average scores based only on actual test takers and use that data in deciding support and interventions. Colorado and Utah are also seeking to be non-punitive. (New York, New Jersey, Colorado and Utah have had strong opt-out movements.) 6) **_New Hampshire intends to rely heavily on performance assessments,_ ** expanding a pilot project in which local assessments can be used instead of state tests in all but three grades. (See cAssessment Matters: Constructing Model State Systems to Replace Testing Overkill, at <http://www.fairtest.org/assessment-matters-constructing-model-state-system>.) Other states may choose to go this route via ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot. _States should prepare for participation in ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot_ and encourage districts to implement teacher-led performance assessing. 7) **_States do not go beyond ESSA 9s requirement to report school finance data, including per-student expenditures, to say what they will do if funding is inadequate._** The reporting will shed light on inadequate resources, a fundamental problem for many schools. However, _states are not required to do anything substantive with this information_. Failure to address this problem leaves states off the hook for funding equity and adequacy. _States should go beyond ESSA requirements to mandate that funding data be included in a school 9s needs assessment_ _and that states commit to addressing inadequate funding._ 8) **_State plans are insufficiently complete about how they will tally standardized exam volumes and track consequences._** ESSA requires reporting on what standardized tests states, districts and schools administer. It also authorizes use of its funds to conduct state and district audits of the amount of testing. _States should conduct_ _audits and monitor districts and schools to ensure they publicly report all standardized tests they administer._ FairTest 9s analysis concludes that education policymakers as well as reform advocates should model their own plans on elements of other states 9 federally approved plans that take advantage of ESSA flexibility. States should adopt a rich array of indicators, minimize the use of test scores, then weight school quality/student success indicators at 40 percent or more. They can sort schools into just three levels. They can include funding adequacy in needs assessments, then move their state to provide sufficient resources to all schools. States can drop punitive sanctions and focus on genuine assistance. States can also refuse to add penalties for low test participation. Some states may be reluctant to take these steps. In that case, advocates, from parent and community organizations to unions and professional associations, will need to exert pressure to win meaningful assessment reforms.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump 9s Education Department is on its way to delaying by two years the implementation of an Obama-era rule that is intended to address the disparities in the treatment of students of color with disabilities. The rule amended regulations that are part of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). John King, the U.S. education secretary in December 2016, said then: > cChildren with disabilities are often disproportionately and unfairly suspended and expelled from school and educated in classrooms separate from their peers. Children of color with disabilities are overrepresented within the special education population, and the contrast in how frequently they are disciplined is even starker. Current Education Secretary Betsy Devos is not a fan of the rule, and last month, the Education Department published a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment on a proposal to delay the rule 9s implementation, which was supposed to start in the 2018-2019 school year. The notice says the department wants to make this move to ensure the rule 9s ceffectiveness can be ensured. The cEquity in IDEA rule is just one of a number of Obama-era regulations\\xa0 aimed at protecting the rights of students that the Trump administration has either rolled back or expressed interest in doing so. In this post, a special education expert explains why delaying the rule 4\\xa0 is such a bad idea. It was written by Catherine Kramarczuk Voulgarides, an assistant professor of special education at Touro College in New York City. She has a book coming out in April of 2018 entitled: c[Does Compliance Matter in Special Education? IDEA and the Hidden Inequities of Practice.  ](https://www.tcpress.com/does-compliance-matter-in-special- education-9780807759011) _[[ DeVos moves to delay Obama-era rule on minority special-education students ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/02/26/devos- delaying-obama-era-rule-on-minority-special-education- students/?utm_term=.d0626c1d127b)]_ By Catherine Kramarczuk Voulgarides Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is moving to impose a two-year delay on the [Equity in IDEA](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-equity- idea) rules, which would have gone into effect in July 2018.\\xa0 The delay in implementation will, at best, promote the status quo in special education 4 which has been characterized by decades of racialized outcomes in the placement, classification, and/or discipline of students with disabilities 4 or will exacerbate these inequities. The department stated its reasons for the proposed delay in the [Federal Register\\xa0 ](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102 /assistance-to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities- preschool-grants-for-children)on Feb. 27, 2018, but minimized the civil-rights issue that is central to disproportionality in special education. Students of color 4 primarily Native American, black, and Latino students 4 have historically been marginalized in the United State education system through questionable special education placement, classification, and/or disciplinary outcomes as compared to their white counterparts. Minimizing the civil-rights issue that is at the heart of disproportionality is a mistake. One reason provided in the [Federal Register ](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)that justifies a delay states: > cT]he Department lacks the statutory authority under IDEA to require States to use a standard methodology [to determine significant disproportionality], pointing out as well that the Department 9s previous position, adopted in the 2006 regulations implementing the 2004 amendments to IDEA, was that States are in the best position to evaluate factors affecting determinations of significant disproportionality. While the logic surrounding state rights is deeply tied to the educational federalism that influences our educational system, it does not engage with the gravity of the civil-rights concerns that are associated with racially disproportionate outcomes. It is not a coincidence that racial disparities in special education mirror broader educational opportunity gaps. The history, tenor, and reality of race relations in the United States infiltrates each school building and classroom of this nation. And it manifests, whether explicitly or not, in our day-to-day educational practices. Denying this reality by not labeling disproportionality as a civil-rights concern does a disservice to our youth. And a focus on preserving states 9 rights fails to recognize how the historical conditions and realities of schooling in the United States, and the resulting interactional and structural opportunity gaps, have systematically disadvantaged Native American, black, and Latino students. Relying upon a racially neutral policy approach that preserves state rights will not sufficiently counter these inequities. And yes, while there are qualitative differences between the educational climate, context, and needs of students in rural Montana, versus Atlanta, versus Philadelphia, versus Seattle,\\xa0 versus Tucson 4 to name a few 4 it is also a fact that each of these locales is linked to a broader American history characterized by a legacy of racial discrimination and institutional racism that has severely limited educational access and opportunity to primarily Native American, Black, and Latinx students in schools across the United States. The state rights argument [also defies the findings ](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1044207311407917)and suggestions of both policy and research reports which have shown that when states have latitude to decide upon how they will identify and address disproportionality, the issue is not resolved and it seems to cexist in some states more so than others. For example,\\xa0 [a 2013 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-137)found that out of the 356 districts identified as having significant disproportionality, chalf of these districts were clustered in five states and 73 were in Louisiana alone. The report further said that the way csome states defined overrepresentation made it unlikely that any districts would be identified within these states. This is perplexing. Do the findings in the [GAO report](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-137) imply that only some states have issues with racial inequities in special education and others do not? This is hard to believe. Even harder to believe, the Federal Register notice alludes to these findings, but it still positions states 9 rights as a valid reason to delay the regulations. Another reason provided in the [Federal Register ](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)that justifies the delay points to a tension between the individualized spirit of IDEA and the call for an aggregate measure that identifies racially disproportionate outcomes. The [Federal Register ](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)notice states: > The standard methodology [for significant disproportionality] improperly looks at group outcomes through statistical measures rather than focusing on what is at the foundation of IDEA, namely the needs of each individual child and on the appropriateness of individual identifications, placements, or discipline. Essentially, the language reads as if tracking an aggregate outcome (such as disproportionality) is contradictory to the spirit of IDEA, which is focused on providing a continuum of educational services to students with disabilities through their respective Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). I have two critiques of this reasoning which highlight, again, how civil- rights concerns do not appear to be at the forefront of any decision to delay the [Equity in IDEA](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-equity- idea) rules. IDEA is governed by both IDEA statues and the logic of the 14th Amendment. These are both sources of federal rights that must be interpreted and implemented in schools and districts across the United States. Unfortunately though, although both race and disability are protected classes under the U.S. Constitution, only crace is subject to strict scrutiny. Disability status is not. Thus, remedying a problem such as disproportionality, which exists at the intersection of disability and race, is incredibly difficult to achieve under the current legal framework. It also highlights a very complex problem that has serious equity implications. In [this 2017 article](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4721&context=caselrev), Natasha Strassfeld states: > As state policy monitoring [of disproportionality] has been found to either inadequately define or find evidence of significant disproportionality across states, potential claimants have relied on litigation to show intentional discrimination. Plaintiffs, however, face an uphill battle in using school- and district-level placement data to prove intentional discrimination, even when policy monitoring under IDEA has led to a finding that significant disproportionality by race or ethnicity in special education and related services has occurred within the plaintiff 9s district. Essentially, it is very difficult to prove that educators, a school, and/or school district has/had an explicit intent to discriminate when disproportionate outcomes are present. And it is especially true when/if schools and school districts are able to show compliance with IDEA statutes. This leads to my second point, and the most consequential one yet in regards to civil-rights protections and IDEA. Arguably, when a school or school district can show that they have complied with IDEA and that there is no evidence of explicit discrimination, then a racialized outcome such as disproportionality cannot be the fault of educators, biases and beliefs, organizational systems, and/or historical and contextual conditions. This reasoning theoretically allows for unequal educational outcomes to be blamed on students and families because, under the guise of compliance with IDEA, educators are not explicitly discriminating against students of color labeled with a disability, even if racial inequities are present. Essentially, a student 9s lack of success in school becomes their own fault, an individual issue, rather than one that is related to broader systemic factors. Thus, arguing that a focus on a group-based outcome is counter to the individualized spirit of IDEA further reifies a deficit-based logic that holds students accountable for school failure, and no one else. This is conceptually dangerous. Didn 9t civil-rights legal strategies and the logic found in _Brown vs. Board of Education_ influence the legislative development of IDEA? _\\xa0_ Yes. Wasn 9t the disability rights movement a collective effort aimed at assuring that all students have equal access and opportunity to high quality educational services? Yes. If we sideline a collective concern like racial disproportionality, isn 9t this contrary to the spirit of IDEA? Yes, because the collective spirit of the legislation dissolves into an catomization of needs politics 4 as noted [in this 2009 article](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ887067) 4\\xa0 that upholds individual concerns over collective ones. In summary, we need to identify educational policy and practice remedies that seriously contend with the historical and social contexts that define the United States education system. If we don 9t, we exhibit a concerning historical amnesia that denies the salience of race in American society and on educational outcomes. This amnesia also promotes a form of complicit compliance with IDEA whereby we are able to comply with educational systems that, with very little effort on our part, continuously reproduce racialized outcomes without having to face any consequences. Because of this, it is not in the best interests of students across this country to be educated in schools and school districts that are not using a standardized measure to track racialized outcomes in special education. ] ",

Many of the technologies in the film are invented or controlled by Shuri, the sister of T 9Challa, the Black Panther and Wakanda 9s king. Shuri, 16, plays a similar role to cQ from the James Bond films, providing her brother and the kingdom with vibranium-powered vehicles, weapons and other innovations. , In a statement, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, Robert A.

Those cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Washington and Oakland, Calif., where the director of cBlack Panther, Ryan Coogler, was born and where some of the film takes place. , Chrissy Booth, the senior director of youth development programs for the organization, said the cities were target markets for Disney. The organization plans to evaluate critical need in those markets, as well as individual clubs 9 willingness to participate, before deciding which clubs in each city will receive the centers. , The organization 9s STEM curriculum gives young people the chance at an early age to have hands-on experiences, like building bridges and light bulbs and creating rock candy, Ms. Booth said. Children then move on to programs that focus on computer and environmental science and digital literacy. , The Boys & Girls Clubs worked with Partnerships in Education and Resilience, the education policy institute at Harvard University, and found that 12th graders in Boys and Girls Clubs were almost twice as likely than their peers to be interested in a STEM career. Fifty percent of girls who participated reported interest, compared with 12 percent of their peers nationwide. , Disney 9s donation imitates the end of the film (and in case it wasn 9t clear, **spoilers follow** ).

That was the conclusion of[ a report from the Children's Commissioner,](https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/Growing-Up-North-March-2018-1.pdf) Anne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide?  There are varying levels of deprivation   There were higher proportions of [children claiming free school meals](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their- characteristics-january-2017) in the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017.    Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than \\xa37,400 a year excluding income from benefits.  * [Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41983610) And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long- term, entrenched deprivation.  There are strong links between deprivation and how well children do at school The link between [deprivation and how well children do at school](https://www.suttontrust.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/1Attainment_deprived_schools_summary.pdf) has been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a \"double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school\", she said.   * [Northern children 'too often left behind'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43500164)   * [Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38172816)  But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived.   He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. \"Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,\" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were \"overly impressed by schools' level of attainment\" rather than looking at children's progress.  * [Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34964522) But even accounting for that, there are still [regional differences when you look at how well schools are rated](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ofsted!/vizhome/Dataview/Viewregionalperformanceovertime) in the comparably deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber.  It's not as simple as north vs south In 2015, the government produced figures on [multiple indices of deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465791 /English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Statistical_Release.pdf) looking at seven main things:   * Income   * Employment   * Health deprivation and disability   * Education, skills and training   * Barriers to housing and services   * Crime   * Living environment  And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as \"south=rich, north=poor\". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption East Jaywick in Essex came out as the most deprived town in England based on the government's multiple indices of deprivation  Is London a special case? Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country.   Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average.   But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government, [starting from the mid- 1990s.](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8006) In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment.  What about the money?   A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like:   * Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals   * Children in the care of the state   * Children with special education needs   * Children who speak English as an additional language   * Schools in areas with a high cost of living  The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving \\xa3500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.  ] ",

In this post, he writes about what he saw and offers advice to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who recently said on c60 Minutes that she had never cintentionally visited an underperforming school. **By Ted Dintersmith** In her recent c60 Minutes interview, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos indicated that perhaps she should visit more schools. Yes.\\xa0 She needs to get out of her bubble and visit schools across America.\\xa0 I did, and there 9s much to be learned. _[[ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stumbles during pointed 860 Minutes 9 interview ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2018/03/12/education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60 -minutes-interview/?utm_term=.04a9d1ac57f4)]_ For context, I spent the entire 2015-2016 school year immersed in education across America.\\xa0 In a trip that rivaled de Toqueville 9s, I traveled to all 50 states, visited 200 schools of all types and talked to thousands of people about school. Questioning my sanity, friends asked, cWhy take such a grueling trip? d\\xa0 But as a career venture capitalist, I know that ever-advancing technology is gutting the economy of jobs and reshaping what 9s needed for career and citizenship.\\xa0 These disruptions have profound implications for the future of our children and our democracy.\\xa0 I wanted to see how schools might take on this challenge. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pjCMmhYl7sQJLao3Rab_jXwvvbs=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q5HFE6FPO43QDFHS73BRWQJRTM.jpg)  During my travels, I met with every element of our education ecosystem 4 governors, legislators, billionaires, school boards, college admissions, textbook and testing executives, bureaucrats, students, parents and teachers.\\xa0 I covered every geography, demographic and school type. I had no ax to grind, no bias to uphold. I just wanted to listen and learn. For an administration that relies on index cards with cI hear you reminders, here 9s what our secretary of education needs to hear. First, America 9s teachers are dedicated, passionate and committed 4 across all types of schools.\\xa0 They care.\\xa0 Many are distressed, even in tears. Like troops fighting an unwinnable war, our teachers know they 9re being held accountable to tests that don 9t reflect real learning, nor lead to important competencies. We are demoralizing our teaching force, driving our best to early retirement and dissuading young adults from the profession that will shape our nation 9s future. Second, I was blown away by the many inspiring examples of great innovation I encountered 4 in classrooms, schools, districts and states.\\xa0 In these classrooms, teachers help kids develop essential skill sets and mindsets. Instead of checking off endless content boxes (AP U.S. History, for example, covers five centuries, allowing a whopping 30 minutes for the U.S. Constitution), students master what they learn, apply it and teach others.\\xa0 Much of the learning is hands-on, tied to real-world projects.\\xa0 Students have voice in creating initiatives and in defining their path forward. Teachers are trusted, and students approach schoolwork with a sense of purpose. Third, I didn 9t find charter schools to be, on balance, more innovative than public schools. Some of the most remarkable innovations I observed were in the very public schools that choice advocates dismiss 4 in places such as Charlotte, Newark, Coachella and Waipahu.\\xa0 And while some charter schools are deeply innovative, many grind away on test scores, with innovation limited to cute test-prep jingles. Free of regulation, you might think private schools would lead the way in innovation, but most are focused on the college application process, a serious impediment to innovation. Fourth, we fail to appreciate the heavy price our students and our teachers pay when we insist, cWe have to be able to measure it. In the early grades, I admired places that made thoughtful, diagnostic use of standardized tests to ensure young kids develop core learning skills. But in U.S. education, the higher the grade, the higher the testing stakes, with myriad adverse consequences. These bulk tests 4 SAT 9s, ACT 9s, AP exams, and especially state-mandated tests 4 are packed with questions tied to content retention, low-level procedures and formulaic thinking. In contrast, the better-designed OECD PISA tests comprise thought- provoking questions.\\xa0 So while U.S. kids lead the world in test prep, our testing regimen values the exact skills automation excels at, rather than teaching kids to think. Fifth, I met thousands of children during my trip.\\xa0 Not one showed any enthusiasm for test prep.\\xa0 But I met many parents, especially the affluent, who relentlessly push test prep on their child, drawing on tutors, pricey devices and manipulative bribes.\\xa0 This difference helps explain why in- poverty kids lag affluent cohorts in test-score cachievement. d\\xa0 To a large extent, test-score performance reflects the motivation and resources of the parent, not the child. Sixth, I was encouraged to visit districts, and even states, that are transforming their schools 4 all of their schools.\\xa0 Their leaders bring a compelling message about the urgency of change and lay out aspirational possibilities.\\xa0 They prioritize essential competencies, not state-mandated tests and obsolete curriculum.\\xa0 They trust teachers to lead the way, both in managing classrooms and designing next-generation assessments. They energize their community, enlisting support in the aspirational goal of helping schools rise to 21st-century challenges. These leaders inspire confidence and exude competence. Seventh, DeVos might be surprised at my conclusions about cthe very powerful forces allied against change she alludes to. In U.S. education, nonexperts tell experts what to do.\\xa0 Priorities are set by legislators, billionaires, textbook and testing executives, college admissions officers and education bureaucrats.\\xa0 These forces, perhaps unintentionally, impede real change in our schools.\\xa0 They push kids to study what 9s easy to measure, not what 9s important to learn. No worries that a steady diet of memorizing content and drilling on low-level procedures produces young adults who are sitting ducks in the innovation economy.\\xa0 Put all the chips on college-ready, discounting the importance of hands-on learning and discouraging those with non-academic proficiencies.\\xa0 Channel kids down the same standardized path, impairing their ability to leave school able to create and develop their own path forward 4 arguably the most important competence young adults need in a world where careers come and go. Finally, business principles aren 9t the key to improving U.S. education.\\xa0 If choice and competition improve schools, I found no sign of it. Pitting schools against each other in a test-score cHunger Games drags everyone down. I saw no sign of union status affecting a teacher 9s dedication or effectiveness. There is, though, one business principle that applies to education.\\xa0 If you want insight, spend time with those in the trenches.\\xa0 Our teachers know how to engage our children, to inspire them to race ahead, to prepare them for adult life. With the futures of millions of children at stake, we need to listen to our innovative teachers and trust them to be the powerful forces for informed, aspirational change in our schools. **Read more:** _[[ A venture capitalist searches for the purpose of school.

Even his youngest son won 9t be admitted unless he passes the blindly graded entrance exam like everyone else, he said.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs from Rublyovka, Moshkovich said in an interview, referring to one of Moscow 9s poshest districts. cEducation is the key driver in the modern world and I want Russia to be competitive. This is for soul and country.     The first nation in space has fallen behind relative newcomers in math and science, mainly from Asia. A top six finisher in the pre-college International Mathematical Olympiad every year until 2015, Russia tumbled to a worst-ever 11th last year, behind upstarts like Vietnam, Iran and Thailand. On a broader level, Russia is middling, ranking 32nd out of the 72 countries in the PISA exam of 15-year-olds, far behind Estonia, a fellow former Soviet republic.   The World Bank warned in November that low government\\xa0spending on education and health in Russia ``may jeopardize both economic growth and the well-being of the population. 9 9 Russia spends about\\xa03.6 percent of economic output on each category,\\xa0compared with 4.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, in the European Union, the Washington-based lender said. Retooling the educational system after communism 9s failure remains a work in progress. Critics like Moshkovich, who got his graduate degree from the Moscow Institute of Radio, Electronics and Automatics, say low morale and chronic underfunding 4even the best teachers can earn less than $250 a month 4are just parts of the problem. They say state primary and secondary schools still rely too much on memorization and standardized testing and don 9t do enough to encourage critical and creative thinking.  cThere 9s no other project like it in Russia Moshkovich, 50, who made his fortune in sugar and pork, retired from the senate in 2014 to focus\\xa0on education. He 9s hoping the methods he 9s developing at Letovo will stimulate reforms nationwide. His school will offer students both a Russian diploma and a certificate from\\xa0International Baccalaureate, a Swiss non-profit with a curriculum it says cprepares students to succeed in a world where facts and fiction merge in the news. Letovo is modeled on the best international institutions in the world, with an expert council staffed by recruits from schools that understand the importance of atmosphere in learning like Winchester College in the U.K., Montgomery Bell in the U.S. and Raffles in Singapore, Moshkovich said. His $80 million campus includes dormitories, tennis courts, a soccer field, a running track, a stream and an artificial lake rimmed by pine forest. The other $120 million is set aside in an endowment, most of which is already deposited in Sberbank and earning interest.

Shchukin said Letovo may be a game-changer not only for his industry but for the Russian system as a whole. Everyone who 9s interested in education is watching very closely because its success may spur more investment, giving parents even more domestic schooling options, he said. Letovo is already taking applications for Sept. 1, when it will welcome 170 students in grades seven to nine.

The analysis says in the North East 35% of white working-class students have entered with only vocational exams. The think tank is calling for more recognition of how exams other than A-levels are used to get into university, particularly by poorer students. And it warns of \"institutional snobbery\" against vocational exams. The research from the Social Market Foundation highlights how vocational qualifications are used for university applications - with about a fifth of places being awarded entirely on the basis of vocational exams.     Vocational exams 'ignored' But this is not evenly spread - with the report highlighting that working- class students from the north of England are particularly likely to have gained places with vocational qualifications. Young people from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications, such as BTecs. Children from poorer families are twice as likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications than the children of professional families. There is also a regional difference, with fewer people in the South applying with vocational qualifications. The think tank says this social divide produces an unhelpful bias in the system - with A-levels dominating political debate about university entry. The report says the emphasis on A-levels means that universities do not always give enough support or recognition for applicants with vocational qualifications. Entry requirements can often be set in A-levels, with the risk of putting off applicants with vocational qualifications. \"For too long, politicians and the media alike have ignored and even belittled the vocational route, because politics and the media are dominated by people who took the traditional route of A-levels then university,\" said James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation. \"Most of the people who run the country didn't do BTecs, and they don't come from the sort of background where BTecs matter most. \"The result is institutional snobbery against vocational qualifications and the people who have them.\" Maddalaine Ansell, chief executive of the University Alliance group of universities, said there had to be support for vocational alternatives to A-levels as a route into higher education - so they did not \"end up being dead-ends\".  ] ",

Also pupils' progress in digital skills has not kept pace with technology, said Estyn in its annual report. The chief inspector welcomed a shift towards a \"culture of self-improvement\" and more joint working between schools. Half of secondary and 70% of primary schools inspected were judged good or excellent in 2016-17. This is broadly in line with overall results since 2010 with the rest judged adequate or unsatisfactory.    Looking after pupils' wellbeing is one of the strongest features of the education system, while standards and teaching are relatively weaker, according to Estyn. Chief inspector Meilyr Rowlands said \"there is much to be proud of in the Welsh education system\" and there are \"many strengths\" in nurseries, maintained special schools and in further education colleges. \"Variability, however, remains a challenge in most other sectors,\" he said. The education secretary welcomed the report as showing sustained momentum in the education system. Estyn's 2016-17 annual report looks at key policy areas over the past seven years, back to 2010 when the current inspection cycle began.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Literacy and numeracy** [Poor results in Pisa international tests](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-25196974) were a key reason for introducing a new emphasis on literacy and numeracy in 2013 as well as a [national reading and numeracy test for seven to 14-year-olds.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38172346) The report says that since then there have been improvements in how schools promote literacy but the standard of pupils' writing is weaker than other aspects. In many primary schools \"pupils struggle to write creatively and do not write at length frequently enough\" and \"too many pupils continue to make basic errors in spelling and punctuation\". Over the seven-year inspection cycle the inspectorate found that in primary schools \"enthusiasm for literature, their knowledge of different authors and stories, and their ability to express preferences about specific books, authors or genres have declined\". Overall the report found that the teaching of numeracy has improved. But the report says: \"In about a third of primary schools and three-fifths of secondary schools, there are shortcomings in the way that schools plan for and ensure that pupils use and develop their numeracy skills across the curriculum.\"   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Developing digital skills** There has been an emphasis on boosting digital and information technology skills in recent years and, along with literacy and numeracy, schools will be expected to emphasise it in all elements of the new curriculum which will be rolled out from 2022. But the report says that opportunities to develop information communication technology (ICT) skills across subjects are \"limited in many secondary schools and a third of primary schools\". In just under two-thirds of primary schools, there are \"important shortcomings in standards of ICT\". Though most pupils are confident using programmes such as word processing and creating presentations, their skills are often limited to \"a narrow range of applications\".   * [Are Welsh schools teaching enough digital skills?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39455837)   * [Learning on iPads 'more enjoyable'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37429889)   * [Computers 'do not improve pupils' results'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34174796)    Image copyrightGetty Images  **The Foundation Phase** Since 2011, three to seven-year-olds have been taught through the [Foundation Phase](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42271232), which is meant to be a less formal way of learning through activities. But the report says that overall its application has been \"inconsistent\" and though there is generally a strong commitment to the principles \"more recently there has been increasing formality\". It says only about a quarter of schools deliver the Foundation Phase well and about three-quarters of head teachers do not fully understand the principles behind it.     [Click to see content: estyn1_jan18](//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/estyn1_jan18)     **Tackling the effects of disadvantage** Another major priority in education policy over the past seven years has been tackling the impact of poverty on pupils' performance at school and, though the chief inspector has found that there is now a stronger focus in schools on this aim, [the gap has not narrowed at GCSE](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-41513404). The report also notes \"despite some improvements, the attendance of pupils that are eligible for free school meals continues to be a concern at all phases\". Over the last three years, about 40% of 14 to 16-year-olds eligible for free school meals have less than 90% attendance compared to 16% of other pupils.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Primary schools** Between 2010 and 2017 there were improvements in the performance of boys and pupils eligible for free school meals. But in a third of schools more able pupils \"do not achieve what they are capable of\". Standards of wellbeing have been good or better in seven in 10 schools and attendance has improved in most schools. But the quality of teaching has varied over the past seven years. In 2016-17, 20% of the primary schools inspected were judged as excellent, and six schools (3%) were put in special measures due to failings.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Secondary schools** Half of secondary schools inspected in 2016-17 were good or excellent, a significantly lower proportion than primary schools. The report says that one possible reason why primary school inspection outcomes are better on average than those for secondary schools is the effect that external examinations can have. The proportion of schools with unsatisfactory standards generally increased between 2010 and 2017. Schools have performed well in terms of pupils' wellbeing and one of the greatest improvements has been in attendance, up from 91.4% in 2011 to 94.1% in 2017. Improved teaching is needed in a majority of schools inspected this year and over the past seven years, the report says.     **Welsh language development** When it comes to the Welsh language, in the early school years nearly all Welsh-medium schools and most English-medium schools pupils \"make a good start\" when learning to speak and listen in Welsh. But there are weaknesses in the way many local authorities plan for Welsh language provision and recruiting Welsh medium staff is \"a challenge across many areas of Wales\", says the report.   ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05vvl86.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionOldcastle Primary in Bridgend already collaborates with other schools on numeracy  School-to school collaboration More cooperation between schools is seen as one of the biggest shifts in education over the past seven years and Estyn believes there is enough excellence across Welsh education to support improvement and help reduce variability.

Political and professional reaction David Evans, Wales secretary of the teaching union, National Education Union Cymru (NEU), said: \"This report shows that despite increasingly difficult funding settlements and the ongoing concerns of workload, schools and teachers in Wales are continuing to provide an education service we can be proud of. \" He said it was \"especially good news\" to see Estyn praising schools for working constructively together. Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said the move towards a culture of self-improvement within Welsh education was not enough to raise standards. He said: \"Everyone knows that unless the government urgently address the underlying issues of diminishing education budgets and failures on recruiting and retaining teachers, this new culture is merely a case of building a house on sand.\" Welsh Conservatives education spokesman Darren Millar said the report highlighted many of the same concerns from previous annual reports. \"It's clear that we need to make much more rapid progress to ensure that our children get the high quality education they deserve,\" he said. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"Our national mission for education seeks to raise standards, reduce the attainment gap and deliver an education system that is a source of national pride and enjoys public confidence. \"The report notes our efforts to reduce the attainment gap, but we know there is no room for complacency. \"That's why we're doubling the [Pupil Development Grant](http://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/schoolshome/deprivation/pdg- and-early-years-pdg/?lang=en) for our youngest learners, so that every child has the opportunity to reach their potential.\"  ] ",

The ban, which came into effect on Thursday, is part of a policy that, the government says, is in line with a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 that said teaching English may hinder the students' proficiency in Korean.  \"According to many English education experts and neuroscientists, the right age for learning English as a second language is the third grade,\" Kwon Ji- young, director of early childhood education and care policy division at the Ministry of Education, told Al Jazeera.  \"Starting second-language education at preschool is too early. Before that, social skills and cognitive development should take place. A lot of parents think earlier the better when it comes to learning a second language.\"  In South Korea, kindergartens that conduct English classes are not officially registered as pre-schools but operate as private academies.  Although expensive, the growing demand for early English education has made these outlets very popular among parents who can afford them.

In Korean society, the more money you have, the more educated you can be,\" said Kim Hee- won, a private English teacher.  Kim, who has been teaching in the capital Seoul since 2003, ruled out English learning having an adverse effect on a child's proficiency in Korean.  She did, however, warn of the increase in demand for English institutions and also of the competitiveness that exists among parents.   {articleGUID}   \"In Korea, some mothers compare what kind of stroller they have for their kids, which hospital their child was born in and how they want to follow the trends.  \"The level of competition is very fierce, and they will spend a lot of money to ensure their child gets taught English.\"  Hwang Hee-jung, a single mother to Ko Jae-joon, agrees. Her son was born in the US and was studying in a Korean school in Seoul until last year when she transferred him to an international school.  \"I think speaking English is very important because the university admission exam we have\\xa0is very tough and students need to get a high score in English to pass,\" said Hwang.  \"In a Korean school, my son was taught English just one hour a week. Now, majority of his lessons are in English, and the more he practises, the better he will get.\"       ---   How an exam brings South Korea to a halt      Together with the ban, the ministry has issued a warning and reminder to Korean parents, urging them to treat English as a second language.  \"It's important how parents perceive English as a second language. Korean children are exposed to stressful learning conditions due to academic pressure. It even starts before they are born,\" said Kwon.  \"The Ministry tries to conduct programmes and seminars for parents to improve their perception of English education.\"  A Ministry of Education official, who wished to remain anonymous, said there would be plans put in place for children from low-income families.  \"The Ministry has plans which include offering financial help to attend English programmes and assisting schools which lack resources to create those programmes,\" the official said.   {articleGUID}   Mobile phone apps and online translation software are being increasingly used for basic communication.  But critics say English fluency is needed more than ever, especially in a society where long hours and extra effort often does not result in success due to the level of competition.  Korean parents will seek private lessons for their children in the aftermath, said one parent, before adding that the assurances handed out by the government will not count for much.  \"We will encounter the unavoidable gap between the haves and the have-nots. It's simple: No money, no opportunity, no education. That's how it will affect the children here in Korea.\"   ** _With additional reporting by Wooyoung Lee_** ] ",

(Benjamin C. Tankersley\\xa0for The Washington Post) Ever year, veteran teacher Larry Ferlazzo makes a list of education predictions 4 and here 9s his list for 2018.

By Larry Ferlazzo Here 9s my annual list of predictions for the upcoming year. Though they 9ve taken a decidedly pessimistic turn since the election of President Trump, there are still a _few_ positive ones among them. Let me know which ones you think are right or wrongheaded and share your own in the comments section. * Now that Justice Neil M. Gorsuch is seated, the U.S. Supreme Court will be set to deal a major blow to teachers, students and their families 4 and public employee unions everywhere 4 when they rule on [the Janus case](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-again-will-consider-mandatory-fees-to-public-employee-unions/2017/09/28/d9cf7aae-a454-11e7-8cfe-d5b912fabc99_story.html?utm_term=.768adb26e461). The five-to-four decision will eliminate requiring worker payment of union fees 4 even though they benefit from union organizing and negotiations. Schools across the country will have to deal with its disastrous consequences, and everyone can see a preview by learning about [what happened in Wisconsin](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/this-is-just-how-badly-scott-walker-has-decimated-public-schools-in-wisconsin/) when legislators passed a similar law. * Two of the biggest foundations in the United States 4 the Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative 4 recently [announced plans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/10/19/bill-gates-has-another-plan-for-k-12-public-education-the-others-didnt-go-so-well/?utm_term=.b5bb18d4b153) that appear to focus less on ctop-down emphasis and more on [community-driven ones](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2017/11/1/zuckerberg-continues-personalized-learning-push-with-legacy-foundation-partner). I 9m predicting that one will actually learn from their past mistakes and genuinely work with educators on the ground 4 and not only charter supporters 4 while the other will fall back into bad habits. However, I 9m not ready to say which is the one that will genuinely follow-through with its good rhetoric. * Hate crimes against people of color 4 particularly against Muslims\\xa0 4 [will continue to rise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/11/17/hate-crimes-are-soaring-but-we-still-dont-know-how-many-people-are-victimized/?utm_term=.cd441837a315). As The [Washington Post pointed out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hate-in-america-is-on-the-rise/2017/11/25/33808364-c94d-11e7-8321-481fd63f174d_story.html?utm_term=.3081a7b4ce77) after the 2017 FBI report on hate crimes was published: c \\u2026 it 9s noteworthy that many of the groups against whom crimes rose by double digits were the focus of inflammatory rhetoric by Donald Trump over the course of his presidential campaign. There is no sign that rhetoric is decreasing, and more and more teachers will be [supporting our students](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2016/07/14/a-collection-of-advice-on-talking-to-students-about-race-police-racism/) and their families [defend themselves against these attacks](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2017/03/22/a-beginning-list-of-the-best-resources-for-fighting-islamophobia-in-schools/). * States will finally begin implementing their [plans to comply with the Every Student Succeeds Act](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/a-guide-to-state-essa-plans-goals-teacher-quality.html). Most efforts will go relatively well or, at minimum, elicit a cmeh from educators on the ground.\\xa0 However, there will be one exception 4 how schools comply with the law 9s emphasis on schools [ creclassifying English Language Learners](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2016/03/23/the-best-resources-for-learning-about-the-ins-outs-of-reclassifying-ells/) as proficient in the language. Notwithstanding what might be good intentions behind the law, ESSA will begin to have a dangerous impact on ELLs as schools feel pressured to cmeet the numbers and reclassify ELLs who still need extra support. These practices will be similar to how schools [ cgamed student test scores](https://www.thedailybeast.com/still-lying-to-children-how-no-child-left-behind-corrupted-education) during the No Child Left Behind era. * More academic studies will be published supporting the [effectiveness of restorative practices](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2016/08/17/important-analysis-of-schools-with-fewer-suspensions-makes-important-points-as-well-as-highlighting-gaps/) as a school discipline strategy (particularly in high schools); the substantial impact of [teacher bias](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2017/11/21/researchers-find-that-african-american-students-punished-more-severely-than-whites-for-same-behavior/) on student discipline; and the inadequacies of standardized test scores to [accurately measure student growth](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2017/11/04/more-studies-finding-that-if-educators-are-good-at-raising-test-scores-theyre-might-be-missing-the-boat-with-other-skills/). The new research on restorative practices will help continue its momentum, the studies on implicit bias will help [overcome resistance to that concept](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2017/08/20/a-look-back-we-should-be-obsessed-with-racial-equity/) from at least some educators, and the work on standardized tests will have absolutely no impact at all. * Congress and the Trump administration will come to an agreement to all the cDreamers under DACA to stay in the United States permanently. However, immediately after signing the bill, President Trump will direct that 150,000 child immigrants who came here as unaccompanied minors [fleeing violence be deported](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-weighs-deporting-thousands-unaccompanied-child-migrants-668778). His order will be challenged in court and ultimately be ruled illegal.\\xa0 In the meantime, however, [high stress levels among many of our students](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/10/26/559914440/teachers-report-stressed-anxious-students-in-the-age-of-trump) will go even higher and provide additional challenges to learning. * This next one is a guarantee 4 residents of Flint, Michigan, including children, won 9t have access to safe water from the tap 4 [they won 9t have it until 2020](https://qz.com/1135850/flint-still-doesnt-have-safe-drinking-water-heres-what-thanksgiving-will-be-like/). This tragedy, which obviously [impacts local schools](https://www.npr.org/2016/02/08/465974192/school-superintendent-in-flint-worries-about-water-crisis-irreversible-harm), has spurred [communities across the country](http://www.businessinsider.com/schools-nationwide-react-to-the-flint-water-crisis-2017-1) to look at their own pipes and water, especially at schools. Some progress will be made over the next year, but not enough. Just as Flint as faded from the front pages, interest in local communities will decrease, as well. * In an effort to stave off losing Congress, the Trump administration and Congress will delay further moves on [degrading the safety net](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2010/12/28/the-best-places-to-learn-what-impact-a-teacher-outside-factors-have-on-student-achievement/) that so many of our students and their families depend on, and this will include forgetting about [repealing Obamacare](http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2017/06/05/the-best-resources-for-learning-how-repeal-of-obamacare-will-affect-students-schools/) and promoting school choice. Their strategy will be successful: Democrats will only narrow the Republicans 9 majority by a net-gain of one seat in the Senate and by picking up fifteen in the House. Those results should mean an even pessimistic list of predictions from me for 2019. * I borrow this last one from educator Bill Ivey every year. He predicts that ceach and every school day will bring tens of thousands of reasons to celebrate in schools across the country. That sure sounds good to me \\u2026 You might want to review my previous years 9 predictions and evaluate the quality of my foresight: [A teacher makes eight education predictions for 2017 4 some of them dire  ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/12/17/a-teacher- makes-eight-education-predictions-for-2017-some-of-them- dire/?postshare=9451481982725428&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.cd28877a42d5)[Eight Education Predictions (and some wishful thinking) for 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/12/25/eight- education-predictions-and-some-wishful-thinking-for-2016-a-teachers-list/)  [Nine Education Predictions for 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2014/12/28/nine-education-predictions-for-2015/)  [Nine educated education predictions for 2014!](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/31/nine- educated-education-predictions-for-2014/)  [10 education predictions for 2012](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs /answer-sheet/post/10-education-predictions- for-2012/2011/12/29/gIQAB2PbPP_blog.html)  [Education-Related Predictions for 2011](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry- ferlazzo/educationrelated-predicti_b_802949.html) ] ",

      "article": "[ WASHINGTON 4 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended her agency 9s commitment to minority students in a wide-ranging hearing in which congressional leaders pressed Ms. DeVos on her department 9s budget. , Ms. DeVos testified before the House Appropriations Committee, fielding questions on the Education Department 9s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October. The request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. ,  cWith this budget, we can continue to return power to those who walk side by side with students every day, Ms. DeVos said. cBecause that 9s who budgets are for, not special interest, not legislators, not the system. This budget is about students. , But Democratic lawmakers disagreed that the budget would benefit all students 4 especially minorities. , Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, called the budget a cslap in the face for minority students. Ms. Lee seized on a proposed $1 million cut to the department 9s Office for Civil Rights, and its proposed cuts to after-school programs. , The cuts, coupled with the Trump administration 9s decision to examine and possibly rescind guidance meant to protect minority students from [racial discrimination in discipline](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics /school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html) and special education decisions, inflamed a debate about the department 9s approach to minority students. ,  cYour head is in the sand about racial bias and racial discrimination, Ms. Lee said, adding: cYou just don 9t care about civil rights of black and brown children. This is horrible. , Ms. DeVos said that she was cvery proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights, and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination. , She also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools. ,  cI believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education, Ms. DeVos said. , She also defended her agency 9s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it [recently became a target](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school-shootings- obama-discipline-policies.html) of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month. ,  cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps, Ms. DeVos said. cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is. , Ms. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country. , Ms. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association. , Ms. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to cspend taxpayer dollars efficiently. , The directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos 9s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee. , One week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was [obtained by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/education-secretary- devos-reorganization-plan-union.html). ,  cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department 9s plans for fiscal year 2019, the email said. cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this. , Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was cabsolutely not true that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present. ,  cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that 4 a deliberative document not in final form, she said. cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization. , While it is not abnormal for education secretaries to reorganize the department, and not many decisions require congressional approval, it is also customary for the department to share details with key committees. , In the email, the staff member leaked a reorganization plan that included a consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Labor Department. , Education Department officials said they had since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most protested part of the proposal. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump 9s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. , Though the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House 9s Office of Management and Budget, [according to Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/14/devos- defies-white-house-education-budget-414849). Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. , Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department 9s programs and resources. , Ms. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop. , Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about ca disconnect between Ms. DeVos 9s administration and his office. ,  cIt 9s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don 9t have staff that understand how the system works, Mr. Frelinghuysen said. cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills. , The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts. , For the most part, Ms. DeVos 9s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services. , Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department 9s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department 9s overhaul. , Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of cofficial time, which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. , The union said the agreement came cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table, which concluded with the department 9s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. , The department said that the union cspent more than a year dragging its feet, and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. , The department put its final offer in place. ] ",

      "article": "[ PARENTS in England are faced with a choice when their children are old enough to attend secondary school. They can pay to send their offspring to a private school, which usually involves sitting an entrance exam. Alternatively, in some parts of the country, the child can sit an eleven-plus exam and, provided they pass, attend a grammar school. Grammar schools are publicly funded and tend to excel in league tables of academic performance. The overwhelming majority (about 90%) of British pupils, however, attend non-selective state schools. Debate has raged for years over whether most selective schools do well because they provide a better education than state schools, or merely because they cream off the brightest and most privileged. According to research led by Robert Plomin and Emily Smith-Woolley, both of King 9s College London, the educational benefits of selective schools largely disappear once the innate ability and socio-economic background of pupils at selective schools are taken into account.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

That information includes DNA data and the results of intelligence tests and exams. At first the researchers calculated a genetic score taken for each child by adding up contributions from thousands of minor variations in their DNA that past studies (including data from 300,000 individuals) have linked to educational attainment. Pupils attending grammar and private schools had significantly higher genetic scores than those in comprehensives. But when those scores were adjusted to reflect each child 9s test results at 11, as well as the education and occupations of their parents, the differences vanished. That makes sense. Previous research has shown that many of the traits that selective schools are screening for are, in part, inherited from their parents. The tests being used by schools appear to be inadvertently picking up some of these genetic differences. The researchers then scored each child based on the results of science, maths and English GCSE exams, typically taken by all schoolchildren in England and Wales at the age of 16. On average, the results of children at private or grammar schools were a full GCSE grade higher than those at state schools. That suggests attending a selective school gives children a boost. Without correcting for any other factors the researchers calculated the boost to be worth about 7.1% of the difference in GCSE results. But was this due to better teaching at these schools or an outcome of the selection procedure? To see, the team adjusted the grades based on the results of each child 9s test scores, family circumstances and genes. Once they did this, the gap between the schools narrowed dramatically, with school type explaining just 0.5% of the difference in average GCSE grades. For any individual, genetics accounted for about 8% of the difference, modest in comparison with the many other factors involved, such as socio-economic backgrounds, test results at 11 and things still to be accounted for. The research comes with important caveats. First, the thousands of genetic variations so far linked to educational attainment are not well understood. Many of these variations may not be linked to intelligence at all. If, for instance, a weak bladder leads a child to perform poorly in timed exams or protuberant ears means bullying blighted their education, genetic variants for these traits will show up as disadvantageous. Stronger bladders and flatter ears will therefore confer advantages and better genetic scores. Second, had the study also been conducted in a nation, such as Denmark, where wealth is more evenly spread it is possible that genetics would appear to play a bigger role in educational outcomes, because socioeconomic disparities would have a lesser impact. The research does not appear to support cprogressive eugenics d, as advanced by Toby Young, a journalist and a co-author of the study. Mr Young has argued that poor people should be able to screen embryos free on the basis of intelligence, if the technology becomes available. Setting aside ethical questions, many of the genetic differences that might appear to contribute to social mobility (think flatter ears, etc) may not be associated with actual intelligence. Overall, such an idea might shift educational attainment by a few percentage points at best. That is tiny compared with the advantages enjoyed by the children of the educated and wealthy.

      "article": "[  Libertarian economist Bryan Caplan didn 9t strive for subtlety when he titled his new book _The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_. As I wrote in a [ Remarks column](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/the-case-against- college) in the print edition of _Bloomberg Businessweek_ , the George Mason University professor makes a strong case that most of what people learn in high school and college is unnecessary and quickly forgotten. He says that only about a fifth of the value of an education is the increase in human capital. The rest is csignaling 4the degree itself puts you in line ahead of non-graduates, even if you learned nothing useful, because it tells potential employers that you 9re reasonably smart, reasonably determined to complete what you started, and reasonably good at fitting in. Signaling is a zero-sum game: possibly useful for the individual who gets ahead, but wasteful for society. I recommend the book. Still,\\xa0I can 9t fully buy\\xa0Caplan 9s conclusion that the solution is to cut back drastically on taxpayer support for college, and even high school. Caplan\\xa0disagrees with my disagreement. On the\\xa0blog he shares with some other economists, EconLog, he [called](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2018/01/two_comments_on.html) my article cfun and fair but indicated that I had fallen victim to csocial desirability bias by arguing that society should bend over backward not to deprive lower-income strivers of the human capital that college does build. (He also made a fair point\\xa0about my throwaway line concerning Sanskrit and cement mixing, and I agree with him, so set that aside.) Here 9s Caplan: > Human beings like saying 4\\xa0and believing 4\\xa0whatever sounds good, even if what sounds good makes little sense.\\xa0My question for Coy: If deleting 80% of the perceived social rewards of education makes you no more willing to cut public support for public education, what would?\\xa0 What if we deleted 90% of education&apos;s perceived social rewards?\\xa095%\\xa099%?\\xa0I know it sounds nice to say, \"If it helps one person, it&apos;s worth it,\" but that&apos;s crazy.\\xa0No one spends their own money so casually 4\\xa0nor should they.\\xa0Furthermore, you can easily use some of the budgetary savings to help \"strivers\" in more cost-effective ways.\\xa0So why not?     So let me answer that question. I accept Caplan 9s economics-y point that life involves trade-offs. If public support for education helped just one person while costing $1 trillion, it wouldn 9t be worth it. Likewise, if Caplan could prove that wasteful signaling accounts for 99\\xa0percent of the value of\\xa0education. But that 9s not what he says. He says it accounts for 80 percent of the value of education. Some other economists put the ratio considerably lower 4less than half. And reforms could further increase the amount of human capital that the education system creates. In other words, education really does educate, even if it is overly expensive and not very effective. When you yank public funding from education, you are making it difficult or impossible for children who grew up poor or in the lower middle class to get the same access to learning that children of rich families take for granted. As for Caplan 9s idea of using some of the savings to help strivers in more cost-effective ways: Tracking low-income students toward vocational education because it 9s all they can afford feels [Dickensian](http://dickens.port.ac.uk/poverty/). Libertarians such as\\xa0Caplan\\xa0stress individual liberty and minimal taxation. Most of us are a bit more communitarian, meaning that we 9re more likely to think of society as a family. A family tries to give every child the very best shot at success, even when it is (overly) expensive to do so. If that 9s what Caplan\\xa0wants to call csocial desirability bias, so be it.  ] ",

(Evan Vucci/AP) More than $1 billion would be spent on private school vouchers and other school choice plans under the budget proposal released Monday by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The proposal also calls for slashing the Education Department 9s budget and devoting more resources to career training, at the expense of four-year colleges and universities. The proposal would cut $3.6 billion\\xa0 4 about 5 percent\\xa0 4 from the Education Department by eliminating\\xa0several discretionary programs, including one that funds after-school activities for needy children and another that covers teacher training. It contains many of the same ideas that DeVos pitched in her budget proposal last year, large portions of which Congress rejected.  cSo many of America 9s poorest children 4 especially African American and Hispanic children 4 attend failing public schools that afford them little hope of fulfilling their great potential, Trump said in his [budget summary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02 /budget-fy2019.pdf). cThat is why families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school option that is right for them. The budget empowers parents, especially of our disadvantaged youth, to choose the very best school for their children. In a separate item, Trump seeks to ax a $40 million scholarship fund for D.C. residents who attend colleges and universities, a subsidy intended to make up for District residents not being able to get in-state tuition. _[[ Trump wants to eliminate federal funding for D.C. tuition aid program ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/12/trump-wants- to-eliminate-federal-funding-for-d-c-tuition-aid- program/?utm_term=.4d0571c1b091)]_ DeVos originally sought $2.5 billion to support school choice initiatives, including private school vouchers, but the Office of Management and Budget rejected her request, according to people familiar with the proposal.\\xa0She is once again seeking to cut several discretionary programs, including federal funding for the Special Olympics and a grant program for college students with cexceptional financial need.  cThe budget . . . reflects our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently by consolidating and eliminating duplicative and ineffective federal programs that are better handled at the state or local level, said DeVos, who wants to eliminate 29 discretionary programs. cI look forward to working with Congress to pass a budget that puts students first and returns power in education to where it belongs: with states, districts and families. Many\\xa0of DeVos 9s budget priorities for higher education mirror provisions in the House GOP higher education bill, giving the secretary a good chance of seeing her vision in that realm come to fruition. Still, the forthcoming Senate version of legislation could be far less partisan than what Republicans are rushing through the House. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has vowed to work with Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the panel, to craft a bill, although the two are heading in different policy directions. DeVos 9s budget proposal last year sought to\\xa0cut 13.5 percent of the agency 9s funding, and aimed\\xa0to cut college work-study programs in half and end public-service loan forgiveness. Congress scaled back the reductions significantly and refused to approve a number of steps DeVos sought, including the work-study and loan forgiveness efforts and a plan to redirect federal money to expanding private school vouchers. ****The budget also includes other initiatives:  4 Allowing low-income students who receive Pell Grants to use them to enroll in short-term programs, although funding overall would not increase much. As it stands, students cannot use grant money to pay for academic programs that are shorter than 15 weeks or have fewer than\\xa0600 hours of instruction time. Although the budget proposal lacks specifics, the department could model legislation introduced by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). The pair have a bill that would allow students to use Pell grants for programs with a minimum of 150 hours of instruction over a period of at least eight weeks.  4 Folding the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, a form of federal aid for the children of deceased service members, into the Pell program to safeguard it from automatic spending cuts under sequestration, a package of cuts that is part of the 2011 Budget Control Act. Democrats proposed the same move in legislation to overhaul the Pell grant program last year.  4 Taking an ax to\\xa0loan forgiveness for public servants and to subsidized loans\\xa0through which the federal government pays interest while an undergraduate borrower is in school.  4\\xa0Changing\\xa0the allocation formula for the work-study program to provide funding based, in part, on a college 9s enrollment of Pell grant recipients. This resembles a provision in the House GOP proposal to reauthorize the Higher Education Act that sets aside work-study money for schools with the highest graduation rates for Pell grant recipients.  4 Consolidating five income-driven student loan repayment plans into a single plan that benefits\\xa0undergraduate borrowers, who can have the balance of their loan forgiven after paying 10 percent of their income for 20 years. As with his proposed budget last year, Trump wants to make good on a campaign promise to shorten the payment period to 15 years for undergraduates, but raise monthly payments **\\xa0** to 12.5 percent of income for both undergraduates and graduate students. Graduate students, though, would have to pay for longer: 30 years. This time, the administration is proposing to automatically enroll people who are severely behind on their loan payments in an income-driven plan, which could help bring down the default rate.  4 Reorganizing the department, including consolidating the Office of Postsecondary Education and the Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education, a move that underscores the Trump administration 9s focus on transforming postsecondary education into career training. ] ",

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Convened to examine the causes of civil unrest in black communities, the presidential commission issued a 1968 report with a stark conclusion: America was moving toward two societies, cone black, one white\\xa0 4\\xa0separate and unequal. Fifty years after the historic Kerner Commission identified cwhite racism as the key cause of cpervasive discrimination in employment, education and housing, there has been no progress in how African Americans fare in comparison to whites when it comes to\\xa0homeownership, unemployment and incarceration, according to a [report](http://www.epi.org/publication/50-years-after-the-kerner-commission/) released Monday by the Economic Policy Institute. In some cases, African Americans are worse off today than they were before the civil rights movement culminated in laws barring housing and voter discrimination, as well as racial segregation.  * 7.5 percent of African Americans were unemployed in 2017, compared\\xa0with 6.7 percent in 1968\\xa0 4 still roughly twice the white unemployment rate.  * The rate of homeownership, one of the most important ways for working- and middle-class families to build wealth, has remained virtually unchanged for African Americans in the past 50 years. Black homeownership remains just over 40 percent, trailing 30 points behind the rate for whites, who have seen modest gains during that time.  * The share of incarcerated African Americans has nearly tripled between 1968 and 2016\\xa0 4 one of the largest and most depressing developments in the past 50 years, especially for black men, researchers said. African Americans are 6.4 times as likely than whites to be jailed or imprisoned, compared with 5.4 times\\xa0as\\xa0likely in 1968.  cWe have not seen progress because we still have not addressed the issue of [racial inequality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/18 /white-people-are-really-confident-things-are-getting-better-for-black- people/?utm_term=.6fbcb7a5edc9) in this country, said John Schmitt, an economist and vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, citing the\\xa0[racial wealth gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and- hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind- whites/?utm_term=.d4a39197bea7) and continuing racial discrimination in the labor and housing markets. cOne of the key issues is the disadvantages so many African Americans face, right from the very beginning as children. The wealth gap between white and black Americans has\\xa0[more than tripled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/05/heres-why-the- wealth-gap-is-widening-between-white-families-and-everyone- else/?utm_term=.f52b3d84a726) in the past 50 years, according to Federal Reserve data. The typical black family had zero wealth in 1968. Today the median net worth of white families 4 $171,000 4 is 10 times that of black families. The wealth black families have accumulated is negligible when it comes to the amount of money needed to meet basic needs during retirement, pay for children 9s college education, put a down payment on a house, or cope with a job loss or medical crisis, Schmitt said. _[[ Bolster black banks 4 and in the process, uplift a community that has been systematically marginalized for generations ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/move-your-money-move- society/2017/03/31/68cb95c8-036d-11e7-b9fa- ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.ee09717635b2)]_ The lack of economic progress is especially startling, given that black educational attainment has improved significantly in the past five decades, Schmitt said. African Americans are almost as likely as whites to have completed high school. In 1968, 54 percent of blacks graduated from high school, compared\\xa0with 75 percent of whites. Today, more than 90 percent of African Americans have a high school diploma, 3.3 percentage points shy of the high school completion rate for whites. The share of young African Americans with a college degree has more than doubled, to 23 percent, since 1968, although blacks are still half as likely as whites to have completed college. Yet the hourly wage of a typical black worker grew by just 0.6 percent a year since 1968. African Americans make 82.5 cents of every dollar earned by the typical white worker, the report said. And the typical black household earns 61.6 percent of the annual income of white households, with black college graduates continuing to make less than white college graduates. Despite the poverty rate dropping from more than a third of black households in 1968 to about a fifth of black households, African Americans are 2\\xbd times\\xa0as\\xa0likely to be in poverty than whites.  cWe would have expected to see much more of a narrowing of the gap, given the big increase in educational attainment among African Americans, Schmitt said. A book, cHealing Our Divided Society, to be released Tuesday at a D.C. forum, also examines how little progress has been made in the past 50 years. Housing and schools have become resegregated, clocking too many African Americans into slums and their children into inferior schools. White supremacists have become emboldened. And there is too much excessive use of force\\xa0 4 often deadly\\xa0 4 by police, especially against African Americans, notes the book, co-edited by Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator and sole surviving member of the Kerner Commission.  cWhereas the Kerner Commission called for 8massive and sustained 9 investment in economic, employment and education initiatives, over the last 50 years America has pursued 8massive and sustained 9 incarceration framed as 8law and order, 9 the book says. cMass incarceration has become a kind of housing policy for the poor. The 1968 Kerner Commission report ended on a note of deja vu, citing a witness who recalled similar analyses, recommendations and, ultimately, inaction following a government investigation nearly 50 years earlier after the 1919 Chicago riot.  cThe destruction and the bitterness of racial disorder, the harsh polemics of black revolt and white repression have been seen and heard before in this country, the report concluded. ] ",

It 9s a [notoriously unwelcoming field for women of color](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/04/27/toxic- workplaces-technology-women-minorities-retention/100977038/), but she 9s ready for it. Ideas for apps are already popping into her head, like one to streamline route planning for student bus systems.  A few hours each day, in addition to her usual classes at one of the city 9s top public high schools, Rayford attends an academic and athletic youth program. She 9s taken several tech-focused workshops at the nonprofit [Downtown Boxing Gym](https://downtownyouthboxing.org/), located on a stretch of road where many of the buildings have been torn down and greenery is reclaiming the empty spaces.  In addition to teaching kids proper combat footwork and punching techniques, the gym also offers free programs for academic achievement and career readiness. It 9s where Rayford learned how to set up a wireless network, take apart a computer and test out a 3-D printer. She was failing math when she started at the gym as a sophomore; a tutor helped pull up her scores.  Rayford still occasionally trains with a boxing coach, but most days she heads straight to the gym 9s computer lab to do homework or write scholarship essays. With no computer at home and unreliable internet, every minute counts.\\xa0 ![](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbfe251e00003b137b003a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale)  Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images Detroit's Downtown Boxing Gym,\\xa0where\\xa0Rayford uses the computer lab before and after school.  If she doesn 9t finish her schoolwork at the gym, she 9ll set up shop on a computer at Cass Technical High School, occasionally skipping a class to complete an assignment for another teacher. There are other obstacles: A recent project required Microsoft Word, but the school had stopped paying for the software. So Rayford figured out a workaround, Google Docs, which she now uses to tap out essays on her phone at night.   cEverything is so zoomed in, and it 9s harder to spell-check and make sure your paragraphs are spaced right, she told HuffPost. cYou know what you 9re doing on a computer, compared to a phone.  Cobbling together computer time frustrates Rayford, but it 9s an ordinary burden for students in Detroit. The largely African-American city of 675,000 has [the lowest rate of internet connection in the country](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2016/11/04/worst-connected- cities-2015/). Nearly 40 percent of households have no home internet and more than 15 percent only have cellular data plans, according to U.S. census estimates. Twenty percent have no computer or smartphone. (Nationwide, [5 million school-age kids don 9t have internet at home](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/22/digital-divide-persists- even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/), according to the Pew Research Center.)  Recent research in Detroit indicates that most teens have some kind of access to the internet 5 but far fewer have reliable internet and computers at home. Many students have more tenuous connections, relying on schools and libraries to get online, or else hopping on and off public WiFi connections from their mobile phones.  As technology becomes increasingly essential for achievement and employment tasks, advocates worry Detroit 9s digital divide shuts students out of opportunities they desperately need 5 most kids live in poverty, and young adult unemployment is more than double the national rate. \\xa0  Connectivity is cthe gateway to so many pieces of life and the economy that the lack of access to internet is really contributing to many of the disparities that we see in urban areas, said Vernice Anthony, interim chief executive of Focus: Hope.

Instead of a total lack of internet access, they see a cmobile-only divide. They mailed surveys about internet use to more than 500 residents in three neighborhoods. Nearly all respondents reported using the internet, which surprised William Dutton, MSU professor of media and information policy and co-author of the report. Dutton told HuffPost he was specifically impressed by teens 9 ingenious strategies for getting online 5 whether tracking public locations with open networks or befriending classmates with WiFi at home.  Nearly half the residents in the survey said they primarily used the internet on their phones. Many of them, particularly teens, don 9t see that as a disadvantage 5 but those users, with limited device capabilities and data caps, were less likely to report cproductive uses, such as homework and job searches.   cThe strong dependence on mobile phones 5 while it mitigates some of the worst digital divides somewhat 5 may be holding Detroiters back, the report warns. ![](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abc006c2000002d00eb34b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale)  Downtown Boxing Gym Many of the students who frequent the Downtown Boxing Gym's computer lab have trouble getting online at home.  Bridging the digital divide isn 9t just about providing cheap, fast internet. Computer access matters, as Dutton explained. And tools aren 9t that useful if students aren 9t taught how to use them.  Qumisha cQ Goss, who runs tech programs at the Parkman library branch near Focus: Hope, said adults often overlook kids 9 digital literacy, assuming they 9ll intuit technology they grew up with. But when students, who can be experts in social media, use library computers for school, she finds, they 9re unfamiliar with basics like how to fill out a spreadsheet or how to double-space a document.   cThat part is kind of heartbreaking for me, because I feel like they 9re being neglected, Goss said. \\xa0  One of the classes Goss developed is Parkman Coders. She 9s taught kids programming with Minecraft, a popular computer game, and by using cheap, cutting-edge hardware built for learning, like [Raspberry Pi mini- computers](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2015/02/raspberry_pi_used_to_teach_stu.html) and [micro:bits](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/bbc-microbit-inside-story). When former students rack up fees on overdue coding books, Goss is happy to forgive their fines.  Parkman and the Downtown Boxing Gym ignite some students 9 untapped passion for tech and give useful digital skills to more. Of the 300 kids who have gone through the gym 9s youth learning program, all have graduated high school, compared with a [78 percent graduation rate](https://www.clickondetroit.com/education/new-data-shows-metro-detroit- high-school-2017-graduation-rates) in Detroit 9s public school district last year. And Parkman has students returning summer after summer for the coding programs.  A smattering of other local organizations are doing similar work or expanding digital equity. However, community programs ultimately serve only a fraction of Detroit 9s disconnected students. (The gym currently serves 185 kids but has more than 800 on its waiting list.) Closing the digital divide on a broader level is more challenging.\\xa0  Nine years ago, Focus: Hope and other partners taught computer skills to 6,000 residents, gave out thousands of discounted computers and worked with an initiative that brought free broadband to a few hundred people. Despite the program 9s impact, it ended when federal funding dried up, and residents lost internet after the service provider went bankrupt.  Internet providers help some get past the cost hurdle, with $10 monthly plans for low-income families. One in 20 residents gets internet through Comcast Essentials, which also offers cheap laptops, free routers and classes. However, the program 9s slow speeds still leave users behind national standards\\xa0 5 it offers subscribers download speeds of 15 megabits per second, lower than the 25 mbps definition for broadband internet used by the Federal Communications Commission. Focus: Hope tried to help people sign up for Comcast Essentials but ended its initiative due to lack of interest 5 residents were turned off by the rigorous application requirements.  The failure of major internet providers to close the coverage gap spurred a grassroots movement, the[ Equitable Internet Initiative](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kz3xyz/detroit-mesh- network), in which local residents have built wireless networks serving dozens of families in three neighborhoods. ![](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abc034c1e00008e0b7b0045.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale)  Kate Abbey-Lambertz Qumisha \"Q\" Goss explains how she uses the Raspberry Pi, a cheap mini- computer, to teach students programming at the Parkman branch of the Detroit Public Library.

(Age? cYou can say 855 plus. 9 d) Ms. Johnson, who was sitting diagonally across from Ms. Bickford, took a bite of her lamb chop. cI 9ve been doing this job for over 20 years, Ms. Johnson said. cI started as a clerk and worked my way up.

The suggested starting point was $246 million. Though the city and the union [came to a broad agreement](https://www.amny.com/news/women-city-workers-reach-settlement-over- unequal-pay-1.13361145) last April, the details are still being worked out. , To help the union build its case, Ms. Johnson spent years gathering information. And she was not shy about demanding her rights. Once, she said, she called a supervisor and asked why she was making less than a male counterpart.

My leadership as a black woman meant nothing to them. , Ms. Robbins described another job in sales where she asked for a raise, from $14 an hour, after bringing in a major client. According to Ms. Robbins, the company 9s owner refused. After quitting, Ms. Robbins said, a man was hired to replace her. His salary? More than twice as much. cThat was the most humiliating experience that I have ever had, she said. , Sitting across from Ms. Robbins was Ms. Webster, 36, who says she left the law firm she was working for in 2016 after she wrote a letter to the partners suggesting that they were acting out unconscious bias. cAt least for one case, and it may have been for multiple cases, my time was being billed out at a lower rate than two of the three white, male paralegals, Ms. Webster said. cThe very next business day, I got put on a performance improvement plan, she added. cThey were putting the paperwork in motion to either justify firing me or getting me to leave. , Retaliatory practices toward employees who complain about discrimination are far from abnormal.

(AFP/Getty Images) President Trump [spoke for](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou_minutes.php) one hour, 20 minutes and 31 seconds (including applause) to deliver his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, and spoke directly about education policy very briefly 4 for one sentence, or two if you want to be charitable. And he didn 9t mention school choice, which is surprising, given that he has said it is his chief educational priority. This is what Trump said in regard to education policy: > As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. There was nothing about school choice, graduation rates, student loans, standardized test scores, curriculum standards. [And as Post reporter Moriah Balingit noted here,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live- updates/trump-white-house/fact-checking-and-analysis-of-trumps-state-of-the- union-2018-address/will-schools-be-included-in-trumps-infrastructure- plan/?utm_term=.75f93fcc3aee) he didn 9t include schools when he talked about rebuilding America 9s infrastructure, saying: cWe will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across our land. The focus on vocational schools is in line with his administration 9s views of the purpose of education: to create skilled workers for America 9s work force, which is rather limited in scope, as Arthur W. Foshay [wrote in cThe Curriculum Matrix: Transcendence and Mathematics](http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_update/eu201207_infographic.pdf), in the Journal of Curriculum and Supervision in 1991: > cThe one continuing purpose of education, since ancient times, has been to bring people to as full a realization as possible of what it is to be a human being. Other statements of educational purpose have also been widely accepted: to develop the intellect, to serve social needs, to contribute to the economy, to create an effective work force, to prepare students for a job or career, to promote a particular social or political system. These purposes offered are undesirably limited in scope, and in some instances they conflict with the broad purpose I have indicated; they imply a distorted human existence. The broader humanistic purpose includes all of them, and goes beyond them, for it seeks to encompass all the dimensions of human experience. Or what Martin Luther King Jr., said about the purpose of education: > cThe function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character 4 that is the goal of true education. Trump gave anyone commenting on the education portion of his speech very little to work with, as seen in Education Secretary Betsy DeVos 9s statement about the address: > cAmerica must do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st century economy. I join the president in calling on Congress to act in the best interest of students and expand access to more education pathways. It is worth noting that despite his call for more vocational education, his first education budget proposal sought to slash [$168 million in grants](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/06/06/all-but- impossible-republican-senator-says-trumps-education-proposal-is- doa/?utm_term=.bb2b4480afab)\\xa0that fund career and technical education programs in high schools. Why? He wanted to use the money to expand school choice. The proposal wasn 9t popular with Democrats or Republicans, and most of the proposed grant cuts were not supported by Congress. These were the only mentions of cschool or ceducation in his 2018 State of the Union Speech, besides the vocational schools remark: > The first pillar of our [immigration] framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age 4 that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet **education** and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. And: > One of Staub 9s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through **high school** , lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax 1cut raise into his new home and his two daughters 9 **education**. Please join me in congratulating Corey. And: > Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters 4 Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens 4 were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa 9s 16th birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa 9s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors 4 and wound up in Kayla and Nisa 9s **high school**. And he briefly mentioned college savings accounts, with cbriefly being the operative word: > Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8\\xa0trillion in value. That is great news for Americans 9 401k, retirement, pension, and **college savings accounts**. ] ",

      "article": "[ The Education Department confirmed Monday it is no longer investigating civil rights complaints from transgender students barred from school bathrooms that match their gender identity, a development those students say leaves them vulnerable to bullying and violence. The Obama administration in 2016 directed public schools to allow students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity, even if that conflicted with the gender on their birth certificates. The administration concluded that barring transgender students from public school bathrooms was a form of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX. But shortly after President Trump took office last year, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the guidance, a move that was widely decried by civil rights groups who\\xa0said it could endanger the welfare of transgender students. DeVos said states and individual school districts should be able to determine how to accommodate transgender students. They argued that Title IX did not obligate schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. _[[ Trump administration rolls back protections for transgender students ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls- back-protections-for-transgender- students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.0b9d4e6180a8)]_ Transgender students say using the bathroom that feels right for them is essential for their safety and well-being and poses no threat to others. Some other students and their families see it as an affront to privacy and traditional values. It is a battle that has been waged at school board meetings, in state legislatures and in the courts. A transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, took his fight to use the boys 9 bathroom to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016. The high court declined to hear the case after DeVos reversed course on transgender students rights. _[[ Transgender teen 9s road to the Supreme Court detours, but his story is not over ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/transgender- teens-road-to-the-supreme-court-detours-but-his-story-is-not- over/2017/03/07/b8c1d010-02a0-11e7-b9fa- ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.7aaebafe5d25)]_ In the aftermath of the move, it remained unclear how the department would handle civil rights complaints from transgender students who were barred access to public school bathrooms. In June, Candice Jackson, the acting head of the Office for Civil Rights, told staff that it should evaluate civil rights complaints from transgender students on a case-by-case basis but did not say outright that bathroom complaints should be dismissed. That same month, the department dismissed a long-running civil rights complaint from a transgender girl in Ohio who had been barred from the girls 9 bathroom at school. _[[ Trump administration 9s approach to handling transgender students 9 civil rights complaints is described in memo ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/06/16/education- department-memo-lays-out-trump-administrations-approach-to-handling- transgender-students-civil-rights-complaints/?utm_term=.309ecd8f8811)]_ Transgender students held out hope that the department would continue to back them when they raised issues about bathroom access, even though the guidance was no longer in place. Advocates maintain that Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, requires schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. Some federal appeals courts have backed this view. But the department interprets the law differently. It confirmed Monday that it will not investigate civil rights complaints from transgender students regarding bathroom access, though it will continue to scrutinize other forms of discrimination. The development was [first reported by BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/edu-dept-trans-student- bathrooms?utm_term=.afY251de6.ctYNZRj6r).  cTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity, Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said in response to questions from The Washington Post. cWhere students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. In the case of bathrooms, however, longstanding regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Pressed on whether the department would investigate such complaints, Hill said: cWhere [the Office for Civil Rights] does not have jurisdiction based on current law [the Office for Civil Rights] does not investigate. That aligns with the view held by some conservative legal groups, which have sued on behalf of students made uncomfortable by sharing restrooms with their transgender classmates, saying it violates student privacy. But Catherine Lhamon, who headed the Education Department 9s Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama,\\xa0called the department 9s statement cappalling and deeply dangerous.  cThe federal courts have multiple times made clear that Title IX protects transgender students, Lhamon said. cThey just don 9t have the option to say, 8We just don 9t apply the law here. 9  DeVos has emphasized that her department would not tolerate bullying or harassment of transgender students, and Jackson 9s memo made clear that the department would still investigate other kinds of discrimination against transgender students.  cPlease note that the withdrawal of these guidance documents does not leave students without protections from discrimination, bullying or harassment, DeVos wrote last year after she rescinded the Obama-era protections from transgender students. cAll schools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment. Still, advocates worry that the administration 9s position will send a message to schools without clear policies that they should bar transgender students from bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. cThe vast number of schools in our country are schools led by teachers and principals and administrators who want to do the best for children but this will just be confusing, said Vanessa Ford, the mother of a transgender girl in the first grade who attends school in the Boston area. cThey hear this and think, 8Wait, am I no longer allowed to support trans kids at our school? 9  ] ",

Several firms now offer face recognition as a commercial service, via their respective clouds. The ability to recognise in faces such things as an individual 9s sex has improved too, and this is also commercially available. The algorithms involved have, however, long been suspected of bias. Specifically, they are alleged to be better at processing white faces than those of other people. Until now, that suspicion has been unsupported by evidence. But next week, at Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, a conference in New York, Joy Buolamwini of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will present work which suggests it is true.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

They tested these on a set of 1,270 photographs of parliamentarians from around the world and found that all three classified lighter faces more accurately than darker ones. All also classified males more accurately than females. IBM 9s algorithm, for example, got light male faces wrong just 0.3% of the time. That compared with 34.7% of the time for dark female faces. The other two systems had similar gulfs in their performances. Probably, this bias arises from the sets of data the firms concerned used to train their software. Ms Buolamwini and Ms Gebru could not, however, test this because those data sets are closely guarded. IBM has responded quickly. It said it had retrained its system on a new data set for the past year, and that this had greatly improved its accuracy. When testing the new system on an updated version of the set of politicians Ms Buolamwini and Ms Gebru had used, the firm said it now achieved an error rate of 3.46% on dark-skinned female faces 4a tenth of that the two researchers had found using the existing system. For light-skinned males the error rate also fell, to 0.25%. This article appeared in the Science and technology section of the print edition under the headline \"Garbage in. Garbage out\" ] ",

Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed 2,387 schools would receive money from the \\xa3750m Pupil Equity Funding scheme in 2018-19. Schools in Glasgow will benefit from more than a sixth of the cash. They will receive a total of almost \\xa322m to help fund improvements at 191 schools. The amount of money each school will get is linked to the number of pupils it has receiving free school meals, with the money going directly to head teachers, allowing them to choose how to use the resources.    Mr Swinney announced the allocations to areas and schools ahead of the visit to St Francis RC Primary School in Dundee, where staff used part of the cash they received in 2017-18 to set up six week-long summer schools focused on boosting literacy, numeracy and wellbeing for pupils in the most deprived areas.  'Significant impact' He said: \"Every child should have the best possible start in life, no matter their background. Schools have a significant role to play in ensuring every child is given the right support to help them achieve their full potential. \"Our priority is to close the poverty-related attainment gap. This \\xa3120m of Pupil Equity Funding is aimed at doing just that. \"The funding is targeted towards schools who have the highest numbers of pupils receiving free school meals, so that the money is spent on the children who need it most.\"   He added: \"Last year's allocation is already making a big impact. I have visited a number of schools up and down the country where this funding has empowered teachers to put in place creative new initiatives that are tackling the attainment gap in their schools right now.\" Neil Lowden, head teacher of St Francis RC Primary School, said the cash from the scheme \"has had a significant impact on how I have managed my school in terms of the absolute focus on raising attainment in literacy and numeracy as well as improving outcomes in health and wellbeing for the children in St Francis\". He added: \"As a head teacher, the Pupil Equity Funding has fundamentally allowed our school community to make a real and significant difference to the lives of the children who come through our doors every day.\"  Temporary posts Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), said: \"The identification of funds to those pupils who need support is always helpful but unfortunately, it is replacing other support that has been lost during a continuous programme of education cuts. \"Schools always want to make a difference to those most disadvantaged with additional teachers to assist access to the curriculum and increase inclusion to activities that most other children take for granted. \"The major worry is the sustainability of the funding and the major investment in permanent highly-qualified professionals. \"The current arrangement has seen a large number of temporary posts being created that are not in the interest of the children who need regular and committed professionals to support them through their education journey.\" He added: \"PEP funding is a start but it cannot close, with the present limited funding, the gap to give the most deprived the same education experience as the most advantaged.\" The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said it had concerns about using free school meal claims as the basis for the allocation of funds. Executive director Eileen Prior said: \"We know there is some good work being done with the additional PEF funds but we are keen to see some hard evidence of impact on achievement and attainment.\"  ] ",

We have been putting educators in front of cameras and shooting video 4 just as the first TV shows did with radio stars, microphone in hand. This is not to say the millions of hours of online content are not valuable; the limits lie in the ability of the underlying technology to customize the material to the individual and to coach. That is about to change, though, through the use of virtual reality, artificial intelligence and sensors. Let me illustrate this with an imaginary school of the future in which Clifford is an artificial intelligence, a digital tutor, and Rachael is the human educational coach. Clifford has been with the children for years and understands their strengths and weaknesses. He customizes each class for them. To a child who likes reading books, he teaches mathematics and science in a traditional way, on their tablets. If they struggle with this because they are more visual learners, he asks them to put on their virtual-reality headsets for an excursion, say, to ancient Egypt. Watching the design and construction of the pyramids, children learn the geometry of different types of triangles and the mathematics behind these massive timeless monuments. They also gain an understanding of Egyptian history and culture by following the minds of the geniuses who planned and constructed them. Clifford also teaches art, music and biology through holographic simulations. By using advanced sensors to observe the children 9s pupillary size, their eye movements and subtle changes in the tone of their voice, Clifford registers their emotional state and level of understanding of the subject matter. There is no time pressure to complete a lesson, and there are no grades or exams. Yet Clifford can tell the parents how the child is doing whenever they want to know and can advise the human, Rachael, on what to teach. Rachael does not lecture or scrawl facts or equations on a blackboard. She is there to listen and help. She asks questions to help develop the children 9s values and thinking and teaches them how to work with one other. She has the responsibility of ensuring that students learn what they need to, and she guides them in ways Clifford cannot. She also helps with the physical side of projects, things made out of real materials rather than in mind and machine. With Clifford as teacher and Rachel as coach, children do not even realize that what they are undertaking is study. It feels like building cool stuff, playing video games and living through history. Clifford, being software and having come into being in the same way that the free applications on our smartphones have, comes without financial charge. Rachael 9s coaching is part of our public education package, funded in the same way today 9s teachers are. We already have wonderful teachers who are supportive and can teach teamwork and values. Believe it or not, we have the ability to build Clifford today. The artificial intelligence tools and sensors to observe human emotion are commonly available via smartphones and digital assistants, and the virtual- reality headsets will soon be powerful enough and affordable enough for holographic learning. Take Facebook 9s Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. When Facebook released Oculus Rift in March 2016, it cost $599 and required a $199 controller and a $1,000 gaming PC. The headset and controller now cost $399 together and do the work of the gaming PC.\\xa0[Facebook says](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__newsroom.fb .com_news_2017_10_oculus-2Dannounces-2Dnew-2Dstandalone-2Dheadset-2Dvenues- 2Dat-2Doculus- 2Dconnect_&d=DwMFAg&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r =FozfRwBUYhObqbKa- g0kKh33gdKARdRC8VIU_2g52uI&m=EilB8AlectwQNNSAtIndA21-hBowlPJpBDtb4kx2uCw&s=RiYHpfxaQnHBt41Is3ImZZ7WYf3UEc8n4dbccMagoBY&e=)\\xa0a new version, Oculus Go, will ship later this year and cost $199.

Caplan is right about kids spending time on subjects seemingly irrelevant to the modern labor market, but he 9s wrong about it being a problem. What 9s wrong with most schooling today isn 9t its failure to meet the demands of the job market, but its failure to meet deep personal and societal needs. Of those needs, none is more important than improving the ability of the young to think for themselves, for the obvious reason that today 9s solutions won 9t solve tomorrow 9s problems. The accelerating rate of environmental, demographic and technological change is creating planet- wrecking stresses and generating problems that existing knowledge can 9t solve. Long-term survival is possible only if each generation is smarter than the one that preceded it. Education policies and procedures put in place beginning with the 2002 No Child Left Behind law haven 9t simply failed. They, along with the Common Core State Standards and high-stakes standardized tests, have tightened the screws on a curricular platform that 9s headed toward a cliff. Respected thinkers have long waved [warning flags](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http- 3A__www.marionbrady.com_documents_QuotesFragmentation.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=4J0_QAeibnm3jIcl0xkCnJnzSloHIHdgphkccWm1tPs&m=SQ6_ZLf5EdrD4F1sUYmzVamEJiADsINMgNSvyTFUcIQ&s=W67gIVnnxofvUJzeclUHLyxZPG5qBji_qFkfmo0u2ZI&e=). The general education curriculum 4 traditional schooling 9s attempt to prepare the young for life 4 is at odds with the nature of knowledge. Nearly all of my 70 contributions to The Answer Sheet over nearly 10 years have been attempts to show that the subjects in the core curriculum are working parts of a holistic structure of knowledge, that adolescents of every ability level can construct useful versions of that whole, and in so doing better equip themselves for whatever the future may bring. What follows is a summary and links to free, illustrative instructional materials assembled from projects my brother, educator Howard Brady, and I undertook for three publishers who saw potential in ideas I had advanced in academic journals beginning with a [1966 article](http://www.marionbrady.com/articles/1966-NewSocStudies-KappanOct.pdf) in the Phi Delta Kappan. (1) We agree with many others that poverty is a major contributor to the achievement gap, but blame generation after generation of basically flat academic performance on the disconnect between experienced professional educators and state and federal education policymakers. (2) We believe poor academic performance is primarily a consequence of information overload. The traditional core curriculum dumps poorly organized, often useless information on learners in unreasonable volumes at unreasonable rates. (3) We believe standardized tests, and the simplistic assumptions about learning which they reflect, perpetuate merely the _appearance_ of learning. Learners ccram 4 store enough information into short-term memory to recite and pass quizzes and examinations. But when those threats no longer loom, most of what was ctaught and learned at great cost in money and time quickly disappears. In no other institution would such inefficiency be tolerated. (4) We believe an effective general education curriculum must have an agreed- upon aim, and that cmaximize learner ability to make sense of perceived experience is that aim. It puts schooling 9s emphasis where it belongs; respects the myriad implications attending personhood; is essential to the success of all legitimate aims of general education, and the inherent complexity of reality and of how the human brain perceives and processes information shuts down simplistic, attention-diverting creforms. (5) The arguments of defenders of direct instruction and teaching scripts notwithstanding, we believe useful levels of understanding of big ideas can 9t be delivered by text, teacher talk or technology. Firsthand experience isn 9t just the _best_ teacher of complex ideas, it 9s the _only_ teacher. Meaningful learning is assembled firsthand and gradually from sequenced experiences, a process labeled variously as active, discovery, inquiry or constructivist learning. (6) Big idea: Knowledge is created by organized human groups 4 civilizations, societies, ethnicities and so on, from which it follows that organized human groups are the phenomenon most needing to be studied and understood. (7) Big idea: From shared experience, groups 9 cognitive systems emerge 4 distinctive structures of knowledge or cworldviews. d\\xa0 Assumptions about the nature of reality, self, others, the supernatural, time, cthe good life, causation and a few other matters shape everything important that groups think and do 4\\xa0 their arts, sciences, institutions, religions, norms, values 4 everything. (8) Big idea: Nothing a group can know is more useful than an understanding of itself, but the cfish would be the last to discover water phenomenon makes acquiring that understanding difficult, and the information, when called to attention, seems too obvious and mundane to teach. (9) Big idea: Understanding other groups 9 worldviews is even more difficult. Most of the content of world histories has been generated by differences in worldviews, as has any randomly chosen day 9s news. Earth and its people suffer catastrophic consequences from ignorance of self and others. (10) Big idea: Human groups are _systems_ 4 integrated wholes 4 and must be studied as such. Academic disciplines and school subjects focus attention on myriad _parts_ of those wholes 4 their environments, populations, patterns of action, and so on 4 but failing to treat those as studies of system components blocks the basic knowledge-relating process by means of which knowledge expands. (11) Big idea: Studying these big ideas is best begun by using close-at-hand reality as the main learning resource. Each school, its contents and its immediate environs is a functioning, systemically integrated whole sufficiently coherent, comprehensive and complex to serve as a laboratory. That laboratory 9s concreteness and accessibility make it ideal, its comprehensiveness makes it an inexhaustible source of data, and its relevance and importance to the young assures engagement long enough for the familiar to become cstrange enough to see. (12) Big idea: Every human, consciously and unconsciously, seeks answers to the questions, cWhat 9s going on here, and what should I therefore do? Lifting that process into consciousness turns information into knowledge, and sometimes turns knowledge into wisdom. It should go without saying that (6) through (12) require learners to hypothesize, generalize, infer, synthesize, relate, correlate, extrapolate, value, imagine and so on 4 thought processes too complex and idiosyncratic for their quality to be evaluated by standardized tests. Useful evaluations of meaningful learner work will inevitably be subjective, a fact which, when understood, helps explain why thoughtful teachers believe grading that work is counterproductive. As the curricular screw-tightening of the Common Core State Standards and high-stakes standardized tests makes clear, education policymakers routinely underestimate both the complexity of teaching and the ability of the young to think. It we change nothing and continue to assume that the core curriculum does the job that needs doing, that teacher experience isn 9t worth its cost, that class size makes no difference, that incompetent institutional leadership has no serious consequences, that H.G. Wells was wrong in arguing that civilization is a race between education and catastrophe, then over the educational catastrophe cliff isn 9t just possible, it 9s inevitable.  To encourage experimentation and dialogue, instructional materials using core- subject content in ways consistent with (6) through (12) can be downloaded from the Internet and used free of cost and obligation. The lessons, and a small e-book arguing the merit of systems theory as the primary organizer of knowledge (and school subjects as secondary organizers), have been downloaded tens of thousands of times, suggesting an unmet need and the potential of bottom-up change and word of mouth to call attention to noncommercial, unadvertised teaching resources.

Marcus, President Trump 9s pick to head the Education Department 9s Office of Civil Rights, is coming under fire from critics who say they fear he will not protect the rights of racial and ethnic minority students. And his ardent support of Israel has sparked protests. Marcus,\\xa0president of a Jewish center for human rights who previously served in the George W. Bush administration, was approved\\xa0Thursday by the Senate\\xa0Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee\\xa0along with two other key Education Department officials. They include Mitchell Zais, a former South Carolina state schools superintendent who will serve as deputy to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The full Senate still must vote on the nominations. Marcus was tapped by Trump shortly after the president was criticized for blaming cboth sides for\\xa0violence that erupted in Charlottesville in August between\\xa0white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members and people who were protesting their presence. If confirmed, as expected, Marcus will be assistant secretary of civil rights, a position with which he is familiar; during the Bush administration, he was staff director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and he carried out the duties of the assistant secretary at the department. He would take over duties that have for months been carried out by Acting Assistant Secretary Candice Jackson. She also was\\xa0a controversial department official, in part for saying that 90 percent of campus sexual assault complaints are the result of too much drinking. She later apologized. _[[ Trump nominee for No. 2 spot at Education Department stumbles on key questions at confirmation hearing ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/15/trump-nominee-for-no-2-spot-at-education- department-stumbles-on-key-questions-at-confirmation- hearing/?utm_term=.88d08413d112)]_ Marcus is president and general counsel of the [Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law](http://brandeiscenter.com/)\\xa0in Washington, which says its mission is cto advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and to promote justice for all. d\\xa0 [His official biography](http://brandeiscenter.com/about/president-biography/) says he founded the center in 2011 to ccombat the resurgence of anti-Semitism in American higher education. Marcus has been vocal in criticizing supporters of what is known as the Palestinian-led BDS\\xa0 4 or Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions 4 movement, which works to diminish international support for Israel economically, politically and academically. In a 2016 piece he wrote [for Newsweek, ](http://www.newsweek.com/anti-israel-boycott-legal-doesnt- look-460843)Marcus called BDS 9s academic boycott carguably anti- Semitic and criticized academic organizations that supported it. He has urged universities not to support calls to divest from Israel in support of\\xa0 BDS, and he has filed complaints with the Office for Civil Rights against several University of California campuses alleging anti-Semitic harassment of students. (The complaints were rejected.) In 2014, his center was one of a number of groups asking Congress to c[end or mend](http://brandeiscenter.com/the-ldb-urges-congress-to-end-or-mend-hea- title-vi-diverse-perspectives-requirement/) federal funding for Middle East studies centers with what it called cbiased, politicized, anti- Israel and anti-American programming. At his confirmation hearing last month before the Senate panel, Palestinian supporters sat in the audience with their mouths taped shut, an effort to underscore their accusation that Marcus does not support free speech and that he makes no distinction between being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.A nonprofit group called Muslim Advocates sent a letter to Congress expressing concerns about Marcus 9s positions on a range of issues, including rights for LGBTQ students. It said in part: > While we take no position on the foreign policy merits of Mr. Marcus 9s views regarding the Middle East, his hostility to the civil right of free speech is well documented.\\xa0 He is a vocal antagonist of the right for college students who criticize Israel to express themselves and has even openly advocated for the abuse of OCR 9s civil rights complaint process to chill the speech of those with whom he disagrees. Marcus is supported by Republican senators on the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, including Lamar Alexander, who is chairman. Alexander, of Tennessee,\\xa0said at Marcus 9s confirmation hearing that Marcus chas a deep understanding of civil rights issues. And he said the committee had received letters from 13 individuals and organizations supporting Marcus 9s nomination, including one from Hillel International, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, which said: > Mr. Marcus has been a longtime champion for civil rights and for college students. We have worked personally with him on several campuses across the country in response to specific issues of bigotry and discrimination, and we have found him to be extremely skilled and knowledgeable in civil rights laws. Mr. Marcus has been a true leader in fighting discrimination.\\x85 But several civil rights organizations have\\xa0 come out against Marcus, including UnidosUS, the nation 9s largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization, and the National Urban League. The groups issued a joint statement saying\\xa0that Marcus had a ctroubling record with regard to enforcing the rights of immigrant students and English learners, and past attempts to undermine critical policies aimed at remedying racial discrimination, including affirmative action. Marc H. Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said in the statement: cMr. Marcus has a demonstrated history of hostility toward affirmative action and all race-based remedies to discrimination. He lacks a commitment to enforcing civil rights protections for students of color, and does not believe in disparate-impact or unintentional discrimination. All of which makes him unfit to lead ED 9s civil rights division. America 9s children both require and deserve an assistant secretary for civil rights who believes it is their birthright to receive a great, equitable public education. At his confirmation hearing in December, Marcus [spoke about](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marcus1.pdf) his experience in the Bush administration and said he worked hard to protect the educational rights of minorities and English-language learners. He said that all students, including transgender students, cdeserve equal access to education and should not be harassed and bullied. But he would not commit to investigating all complaints, saying they would be handled on a case-by-case basis. And he said he wasn 9t sure if the department had jurisdiction to protect the rights of undocumented students, as seen in this exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): > WARREN: Given the climate of fear and uncertainty that Donald Trump has created for Dreamers, if the school said happy to enroll all 5-year-olds in kindergarten, but kids who can 9t prove that they are citizens will be barred at the door. Would your office step in to protect the civil rights of those students from discrimination? > > MARCUS: Well, to my ear, senator, that sounds like a violation of law, but I don 9t know whether it would be a violation of one of the laws of which OCR has jurisdiction. There are certain rules here that would fall under the Equal Protection Clause. We would step in, if I were confirmed, if there 9s a violation of one of OCR 9s statutes. Here 9s another exchange between Warren and Marcus: > WARREN: Mr. Marcus, if confirmed, you would be responsible for protecting the civil rights of American students at a time when Nazis and white supremacists are marching across college campuses with tiki torches, and many young people are literally afraid to go to school because of the hateful climate that has been fostered by Donald Trump. If confirmed, will you commit to fully enforcing civil rights laws and protecting all students from discrimination and harassment? > > MARCUS: Yes. > > WARREN: Good. So, I just want to find out a little more detail about what that commitment means to you, and I thought we might go through a few fact situations. So, let 9s start with an easy one. Say there 9s a school district that has some mostly white schools and some mostly black schools, and let 9s say that the mostly black schools have less experienced teachers, teachers with fewer qualifications, those schools have fewer books, they have fewer computers in the library, fewer AP courses available. By any objective measure, those schools have clearly been shortchanged. If confirmed, would your office step in to protect the civil rights of that district 9s black students? > > MARCUS: If I were confirmed, I would ensure that any complaints alleging violation of Title VI would be 4 would be reviewed. > > WARREN: Mr. Marcus, I don 9t want to start a dance here. This is a set of facts that come to you in your position, if you are confirmed, and my question is are those facts adequate? Will you step in to protect the civil rights of the district 9s black students? > > MARCUS: Senator, I would certainly hope to be able to provide protection for the civil rights of those black students to the extent possible under law, but what . . . > > WARREN: But, that 9s the question I 9m asking how you see this. You 9re allowed to answer hypotheticals, here, so this one should be easy. A yes or a no, would you step in on those facts, or not? > > MARCUS: I appreciate that, senator, but unfortunately in my experience the cases that OCR deals with are much more complicated than hypotheticals. > > WARREN: So, you don 9t think that 9s enough evidence, what I 9ve just said? > > MARCUS: I think I would need to look at it very carefully. After questioning him, Warren said: cI don 9t think we need someone in this position whose view of civil rights enforcement is to do as little as possible to protect as few students as possible. I think that would be bad for students overall, and with Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, I think it would be even worse. The Senate committee also approved Zais as the department 9s No. 2. He is a former president of a\\xa0college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. And it approved Jim Blew, who was nominated to be assistant secretary for planning, evaluation and policy development. He was director of the Walton Family Foundation 9s K-12 reform efforts for nearly a decade,\\xa0and also national president of StudentsFirst, the reform organization started by former D.C. schools chancellor Michelle Rhee. There are 15 positions in the Education Department that must be confirmed, and so far the committee has confirmed four. One nominee was withdrawn by Trump, and six positions have no nominee\\xa0awaiting committee attention,[ according to a Washington Post tally. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics /trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/?utm_term=.a597d8bd5c4e)There are five positions with pending nominees, including Marcus, Zais and Blew. The committee announced Thursday it would hold a hearing next week to consider Trump 9s nomination of Frank Brogan, a former lieutenant governor of Florida and former chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, as assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education. ] ",

      "article": "[ HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) is a poorly named department. It usually has few resources other than overworked staff, clunky technology and piles of employee handbooks. Hassled recruiters have to sort through reams of applications that vastly outnumber the jobs available. For example, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), a consumer-goods company, receives 1.2m applications for 25,000 positions every year. AI-enabled systems can scan applications far more quickly than humans and work out whether candidates are a good fit. Oddly enough, they may also inject more humanity into hiring. According to Athena Karp of HiredScore, a startup that uses algorithms to screen candidates for J&J and others, only around 15-20% of applicants typically hold the right qualifications for a job, but they are rarely told why they were not hired, nor are they pointed to more suitable jobs. Technology is helping cgive respect back to candidates d, she says.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Nvidia, a chipmaker, also gets more r\\xe9sum\\xe9s than it can comfortably cope with, so it spent a year building its own system to predict which candidates are worth interviewing. It has recognised patterns that recruiters might not: for example, candidates who submit especially long r\\xe9sum\\xe9s turn out to do less well than others, so those extra words will count against them. Hilton, a hotel chain, has shortened the average time it takes to hire a candidate from 42 days to five with the help of HireVue, a startup. It analyses videos of candidates answering questions and uses AI to judge their verbal skills, intonation and gestures. This can be especially helpful when the candidate comes from a different culture or speaks another first language, says Ellyn Shook, chief leadership and HR officer of Accenture, a consultancy with 435,000 employees that also uses HireVue. Employers tend to hire candidates who are like themselves, which makes for undiversified workplaces. Orchestras, for example, used to be mostly male. Recruitment of female musicians went up only when they introduced cblind auditions behind a screen. Algorithms can act as virtual screens, making hiring fairer. Pymetrics, a startup whose clients include companies such as Unilever, a consumer-goods giant, and Nielsen, a research firm, offers a set of games for candidates to play, usually at an early stage of the recruitment process, that ignore factors such as gender, race and level of education. Instead they test candidates for some 80 traits such as memory and attitude to risk. Pymetrics then uses machine learning to measure applicants against top performers and predict their suitability for a role. This can help candidates without conventional qualifications. Another firm that is helping companies become more diverse is Textio, a startup that uses AI to improve job descriptions. For example, it has found that corporate jargon like cstakeholders and csynergies tend to drive away certain candidates, especially non-whites, and that women are less likely to apply for a job that is described as cmanaging than cdeveloping a team. Tweaking job descriptions can get 25% more qualified people through the door and boost recruitment among minorities, says Kieran Snyder, Textio 9s boss.

In the past, there was no way of redirecting them to other jobs as they became available. AI will make it possible to crepurpose candidates we have attracted before d, says Sjoerd Gehring, vice-president of talent acquisition for J&J. The health-care giant uses HiredScore, a startup, to grade candidates. When a vacancy opens up, the system automatically generates a shortlist of candidates that could be a good fit. This will bring big cost savings, says Mr Gehring. AI can also help with managing employees. HR professionals and recruiters at big firms cannot possibly know all their own talented workers across countries and departments, says Chris Louie of Nielsen. His company is using AI to improve internal mobility. Twine Labs, a startup that is working with Nielsen, suggests internal candidates for new roles, based on employee data and job requirements, taking in hundreds of variables. Around half the candidates it suggests are approved and promoted, says Joseph Quan, Twine Labs 9 boss. That is about the same success rate as for a human recruiter. Another use for AI is to help employers reduce staff turnover. On average, replacing a worker takes around 20% of annual salary, sometimes much more. Workday, a software firm, has started to predict how likely employees are to leave. It looks at around 60 factors 4such as pay, time between holidays taken and turnover in managers to whom the employee reports 4and flags those at risk of quitting so companies can try to retain them. Arena, a startup that works with hospitals and care-home companies, where turnover is high, considers retention even before it takes someone on. By using data from job applications and third parties to predict which applicants are likely to stay for more than a year, Arena has reduced its clients 9 median turnover by 38%, says Michael Rosenbaum, Arena 9s boss. In future AI may also be used to determine pay. Infosys is looking into using AI to decide when to give employees a rise, based on their performance and their pay relative to that of colleagues. The technology will make pay fairer by taking biases and personality traits out of consideration, says Sudhir Jha, head of product management and strategy at Infosys. But there is a risk that workers will try to game the system. All this points to a broader issue in AI: transparency. Companies will need to ensure that algorithms are being constantly monitored. In America, where it is illegal to discriminate against protected groups such as racial minorities, firms must be able to prove that they are hiring from these groups roughly in proportion to the population and are not introducing any bias, says Mr Rosenbaum. Startup bosses say they offer their clients transparency and regularly check their algorithms to make sure they are free of bias. But as AI becomes more prevalent, concerns will grow that algorithms could reinforce discrimination. Recruitment is just one example of the technological disruption that AI will bring to the workforce. The number of recruiters will come down, because AI will handle many of the mundane tasks they used to do, and face-to-face interviews will become rarer. At Unilever only shortlisted candidates are now interviewed, after several rounds of AI-enabled screening and recorded interviews through HireVue. For the remaining recruiters, though, AI will make work easier and more interesting. It may even help some of the workers it displaces. Accenture is rolling out a custom-built tool called Job Buddy which tells employees how vulnerable their job is to automation and predicts what training they might need so they can develop the right skills for the future. Ms Shook of Accenture says that around 80% of the people who have tried it are taking the advice it offers. But they may not have much choice.

School administrators and educators must be cognizant of the racial realities that young people encounter daily. And the legal system must take seriously the complaints of young people of color who face police brutality, stop and frisk, deportations and the school- to-prison pipeline. Otherwise, young people will confront challenges ranging from achievement and wage gaps to isolation to a sense that they just don't belong in America. We can and must do better to address the racial realities that young people face in America today, and there are a few concrete steps we can take.

School counselors must provide culturally specific services and resources to children who feel targeted to strengthen their mental well-being and self-esteem. Parent-teacher associations and school boards must ensure that schools remain places of sanctuary and refuge for students.

Although there is something particular in the overt discrimination practiced toward Marina, the movie bridges language and cultural barriers, striking an emotional chord with the universal nature of its themes. It's worth noting, too, that the small, intimate approach to the story makes this a movie that will play perfectly well on TV, which is where many people will no doubt catch up with it.

It affects civic engagement, home ownership, job status, income, just to name a few things. And it affects health. In this piece, Karin Fischer writes about why education matters to your health 4 literally. Fischer is a\\xa0 senior reporter at [the Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Education-Matters-to- Your/242123), where this first appeared, and which gave me permission to republish it. Karin Fischer covers the business of international education and the globalization of higher education, including competition for foreign students, activities by American colleges overseas, policies and programs that affect the international activities of American colleges, and the internationalization of the college experience. **_By Karin Fischer_** Across America, people are falling ill and dying young. These men and women have something in common. In fact, they stand out because of something they don 9t have: a college degree. A [recent report,](https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/08/casetextsp17bpea.pdf) by Princeton University economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, made the stakes clear: Men and women who haven 9t been to college live shorter, less healthy lives, and are losing ground compared with college graduates. This is about more than money: the findings suggest that pain, stress, and social dysfunction may all play a role. Here 9s what you need to know about the research. Case and Deaton found that less-educated Americans were dying younger. Is that really so striking? In a word, yes. For decades, life expectancy for Americans has been improving, thanks to advancements in technology and medical care. Before 1999, middle-age mortality rates were declining by about 2 percent a year. But suddenly, starting in the late 1990s, rates of morbidity and mortality 4 in other words, of sickness and death 4 began to increase for white men and women between the ages of 45 and 54 who did not have a college degree. Since then those rates have been climbing by about half a percentage point a year among the white working class. cIn this historical context of almost continuous improvement, d\\xa0 Case and Deaton wrote, cthe rise in mortality in midlife is an extraordinary and unanticipated event. The researchers originally noticed rising death rates among the middle-aged and now see a similar deterioration for less-educated adults of all ages. The one exception is the elderly. At the same time, however, longevity has continued to improve for people who hold college degrees. The resulting disparity is striking: The mortality rate for 50- to 54-year-old men without a bachelor 9s degree is 867 per 100,000; for their more-educated peers, it 9s just 243. While there 9s long been a gap in health outcomes based on education, it looks now more like a yawning gulf. Is this just another way of saying that poor people are sicker? Yes, but that 9s not all that 9s going on. People with steady, well- paying jobs tend to be in better health, and that 9s especially true in the United States, where we have a system of employment-based health insurance. But the relationship between education and health is significant and independent of socioeconomic status. So, what 9s going on? Why does education matter? That 9s not an easy question to answer. Experts say there are all sorts of [links between education and health,](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146517715671?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&) and whether there 9s a direct relationship between the two isn 9t entirely clear. People with degrees have more and better access to health care. They report greater job satisfaction and lower levels of stress. They read up on scientific breakthroughs and heed their doctor 9s advice when it comes to behaviors like eating healthfully, exercising, and quitting smoking. They are less likely to live near factories or freeways that belch pollutants into the air and are more apt to be surrounded by people like them, who reinforce healthful living. As one public-health researcher put it, the well-educated have a deeper bucket of resources to draw on. Case and Deaton, the Princeton economists, have their own idea, linking the increasing mortality rate to an uptick in deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and from suicide 4 what they call cdeaths of despair. Their theory goes like this: Over the past several decades, the economy has shifted, eliminating many of the jobs that once went to people without college degrees. The share of men in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who are not in the work force has [more than tripled](ttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/12/upshot/where-men-arent- working-map.html) since the late 1960s. Those who do have jobs are unlikely to be pulling in the same sorts of wages as generations before them. Unable to provide a middle-class life, they may put off marriage; their social ties are often weaker. People without college degrees report being less happy than those with more years of schooling. As a result, they may turn to alcohol or drugs to cope. Deaths from opioids, in particular, have been soaring, and most of those who overdose are white. In short, the tough labor market may be at the root of the worsening mortality rates for those without higher education, but that 9s not the only thing to blame. Instability, dysfunction, stress: these cumulative disadvantages add up, exacting a deadly toll. You 9ve mentioned several times that death rates have climbed specifically for white Americans. Why focus on white people? Wouldn 9t members of minority groups be similarly affected by changes in the economy? Fair point 4 if anything, black and Hispanic Americans suffer from greater educational and economic inequities than their white counterparts do. Yet they have continued to show improvements in health and longevity. Partly it 9s that they 9ve long suffered from ill health and earlier deaths. Even with progress, there 9s still a long way to go. In fact, a new [study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/13/1714616114.full.pdf) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill suggests that black and Hispanic young adults from poor backgrounds actually are in worse physical health if they complete college. Experts such as Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at the Johns Hopkins University, speculate that racial differences also might be a matter of expectations. It wasn 9t long ago that [white working-class Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/opinion/why-are-white-death- rates-rising.html) could count on leading a comfortable life with just a high- school degree. Middle-aged men and women, the very group falling ill and dying, are the first generation without that guarantee. They compare themselves with their parents and find their lives falling short. For black and Hispanic Americans, if you haven 9t got as much to hope for, you might just have less to lose. Come to think of it, you keep talking about Americans. What about people in other countries who don 9t have college degrees? Are they, too, getting sicker? They 9re not. Even right next door in Canada, longevity continues to improve. One reason might be that workers in other industrialized countries haven 9t experienced the same wage stagnation as have those here. But it 9s also the case that in Canada and throughout Europe, the social safety net is more pronounced. If where you live in the world makes a difference, are there healthier places within the United States? Case and Deaton play down geography in their work, saying that they spot the trend of increasing mortality across all regions of the country and in both rural and urban areas. But other researchers argue that location does matter. Rural America has been [hit hard](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Big- Bet-on-Higher/239585) by the changing economy, and the people there tend to be older, white, and less-educated than those in the cities and suburbs. What 9s more, a lot of public policy that affects the poor and less educated is set at the [state and local levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865154/), points out Jennifer Karas Montez, an assistant professor of sociology at Syracuse University. That means there are places where it 9s tougher to be poor and without a degree. What 9s the solution: Just send more people to college? Few experts think that the answer is college for all. Instead they call for policy fixes that could help ease the disadvantage that comes from not having a degree. As a country, they argue, we should find more ways into the middle class that don 9t require a four-year degree, such as more-robust apprenticeship or training programs. They also call for strengthening the social safety net. States, for instance, could expand health coverage under the Affordable Care Act to help the working poor. They could raise cigarette taxes to make smoking cost-prohibitive for low-income residents. Education will still matter, but policy choices could mitigate its effect on health. It 9s true that more people today are earning college degrees, but perhaps that precisely why we ought to be worried about those who don 9t. While this group may be smaller, the disadvantages they face are compounding, and they are falling further behind. The divide between the haves and have-nots is widening. ] ",

      "article": "[ In 2005, Gerry Adams went to South Africa. After landing in Johannesburg, he laid a wreath at Freedom Park before driving to the University of Witwatersrand to make a speech.  At that point, he'd been the leader of the Irish nationalist party, Sinn Fein, for 22 years. It was a party [Nelson Mandela](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/nelson-mandela-nation- father-20126254044646548.html) described as \"an old friend and ally\", and this was one of several visits to South Africa by Gerry Adams that aimed to burnish his moral credentials as a peacemaker.  Waiting at the university was a BBC journalist who had scheduled an interview with the politician, and was struggling to find an interesting angle on a story about a man made famous in a conflict that had long since ceased to be \"top of the bulletin\"\\xa0material.  The interview started politely as Adams related his time in South Africa, and then the BBC journalist changed tack. Pointing to the African National Congress' (ANC)\\xa0largely peaceful overthrow of the apartheid regime, he asked Adams if he felt Mandela's party enjoyed a kind of moral legitimacy that Sinn Fein never would.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/2af8c6073e334a8fa49b5e130de87cf8_18.jpg)  ---  South African President Nelson Mandela meets with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in 1995 at the African National Congress headquarters in Johannesburg [Juda Ngwenya/Reuters]     He was, of course, referring to Sinn Fein being the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), an organisation responsible for killing more than 1,700 people.  It was an abrupt and unwelcome confrontation between two sides of Adams' persona, two epochs of his life: the defender of violence, and the man of peace. The politician responded by suggesting bias on the part of the BBC; the interview went cold, ended awkwardly, and was never broadcast.  Adams will soon step down as leader of Sinn Fein after 35 years at the helm. In that time, he has catapulted the party out of political obscurity.  Last year, Sinn Fein came within one seat of shredding the domination of pro- British political parties in Northern Ireland, a feat that could very well have resulted in a referendum on ending British rule there.  This success was built on the back of a negotiated settlement that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, a settlement in which Gerry Adams played a large part. As political resumes go, it's an impressive one.   A 'significant' figure  Former IRA man Tommy McKearney is not a cheerleader for Adams. Nonetheless, he describes him as \"one of the most significant major figures in Irish political life over the last 40 years, whether one likes or dislikes him\".  Adams' significance comes from him having persuaded the IRA to give up the use of armed force and to replace it with constitutional politics to achieve a united Ireland. This is a point even his unionist opponents acknowledge.  Ben Lowry, deputy editor of the Northern Irish unionist daily newspaper, the News Letter, says: \"He definitely steered the IRA, over a long period of time from the early 1980s until the late 1990s, away from violence.\"  Born into a poor family in west Belfast in 1948, Adams became involved in nationalist politics in the 1960s.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/79ca2363265a491aacacd03b1ea92679_18.jpg)  ---  Gerry Adams with Christy Burke, Sinn Fein's candidate in Dublin Central, in 1983 [Independent News and Media/Getty Images]     By his early adolescence, Northern Ireland had been run for 40 years by the Ulster Unionists, pro-British and almost entirely Protestant.  Injustices against Catholics, including discrimination in the allocation of housing and unequal voting rights, gave rise to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. Adams signed up to the organisation in 1967.  Two years later, a cocktail of political turmoil pushed this small region of the UK, containing just 1.5 million people, over a cliff.  Sectarian rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Belfast and Londonderry prompted a plea from the government for British troops on the ground. The troops were at first welcomed by Irish nationalists and Catholics as protectors, but quickly became the target of IRA gunmen, who saw them as illegitimate enforcers of British occupation.  The decades-long conflict that followed saw the Provisional IRA emerge as a deadly force that killed thousands of policemen, soldiers and civilians, as well as senior figures in the British government, almost claiming the life of Prime Minister [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2013/04/20134814012127352.html).   Deadly hunger strikes  Gerry Adams spent the 1970s being variously interned and arrested for alleged IRA activity but has always denied being a member.  It was the events of 1981 that gave rise to his political career.  That was the year that 10 IRA prisoners starved themselves to death, using a hunger strike to demand political status that the British government refused to grant.  The outpouring of emotion that followed encouraged the Sinn Fein leadership to seek an electoral mandate that would back up their claims of widespread support for British withdrawal and Irish unification.  They would proceed, in the words of one activist, \"with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other\".\\xa0   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/dd04213287b14b79b441b92189861187_18.jpg)  ---  Martin McGuiness and Gerry Adams pictured in 1985 [Independent News And Media/Getty Images]     Adams took over the leadership in 1983 and put that strategy into action.  McKearney was one of those who participated in a lesser known hunger strike in 1980.  Adams, he says, did not conceive of the strategy independently, but cultivated it and persuaded others.  \"The argument was being made through the 80s that there had to be an alternative,\" he says. \"The IRA, Sinn Fein and the republican movement, in general, has a political objective, and decisions were made pragmatically and rationally about how best to advance that political agenda.  \"Once it was deemed important to defend that position with arms and then the decision was taken to move away from arms, it wasn't useful any longer, and the movement was persuaded of that by Gerry and others.\"  What began as a dual strategy evolved over the course of the 1980s into a view among many in Sinn Fein that continued violence was pointless.  Some of this was likely motivated by the very successful efforts of British intelligence to undermine the IRA through a network of informers.  McKearney does not refer to this, but does describe the British state as a \"very strong and determined enemy\", and admits that \"some options were closed down and others opened up\".  Something of a window of opportunity for peace negotiations was opened in the 1990s. By the end of that decade, Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness had persuaded their party to enter into an agreement that would eventually see the IRA end its armed campaign and decommission its weapons in return for the release of prisoners and political representation in the government of Northern Ireland.  Gerry Adams, a man whose voice had been banned on British television four years earlier, now occupied an office in Stormont, formerly the seat of unionist power.  But observers point to a contradiction in that success. How, they ask, could Adams have so successfully controlled a notorious paramilitary group of which he has consistently denied ever being a member?  Since the peace agreement in 1998, Adams has been plagued by accusations from unionists and nationalists alike that he not only joined but helped to lead the IRA in the worst years of Northern Ireland's violence.  In 2014 he was questioned for four days by Northern Irish police in connection with the 1972 murder of a single mother of 10 children. He was released without charge.   'He can't tell the truth from lies'  There are those who excoriate Adams' record, and among them is former IRA member Shane Paul O'Doherty. Since spending a decade and a half in jail for his part in a letter-bombing campaign, O'Doherty has renounced violence entirely.  He calls Adams a \"strategist, full of charisma, a great cult leader, he has people who will follow him to hell\", but, he says, \"at this stage in his career [he] can't tell truth from lies\".  Editor Lowry says: \"Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community\".  Adams' characteristic opacity has fuelled speculation over his past. He is, says Lowry, \"mysterious, hard to read, inscrutable\". For unionists, that's disconcerting, especially since Adams is a man who gets results; for those who support him, it breeds respect.  > Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community.\\r > > Ben Lowry, News Letter\\xa0deputy editor > >   Even in the twilight years of his political career, Adams has continued to evolve and grow in stature.  He gave up his place in Northern Ireland's assembly to campaign for and win a seat in the Dail - the elected legislature of the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein is now the third largest political force in the Republic.  The party's future lies in consolidating its position on both sides of the Irish border; a future bought for it by the leadership of Gerry Adams.\\xa0  Most commentators believe Adams will remain an essential figure to his party behind the scenes, inhabiting a perhaps familiar position, in the shadows. ] ",

The report, c[Online Learning: What Every Parent Should Know, ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/22/university- of-wisconsin-students-protest-plan-to-drop-slew-of-liberal-arts-majors/)says that cshifting terminology of online learning is confusing, making it difficult for researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and the general public to know what K-12 online learning really is. The report\\xa0explains the different ways online education is provided to students, and looks at the issue of student data privacy, which gets short shrift from policymakers eager to push online education. Recent online data breaches 4 including Facebook 9s 4 show that kids 9 personal information isn 9t as private online as you may think. _[[ The astonishing amount of data being collected about your children ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/11/12/the- astonishing-amount-of-data-being-collected-about-your- children/?utm_term=.16e23061f847)]_ The report was published by the nonprofit Network for Public Education, an advocacy group that fights to strengthen public schools. It was founded by education historian and advocate Diane Ravitch and educator Anthony Cody. The report notes that many students are required to use online programs, textbooks and apps as part of their schoolwork, and some states mandate that every student take at least one online course. Yet, it says: > The increased reliance on technology in schools is moving at a breakneck speed 4 one that far exceeds the accumulation of research on its effectiveness. Does online and blended learning enhance student learning? What do we know about virtual schools? How does profit influence policy decisions on the use of technology? > > Beyond questions of effectiveness, there are also student privacy concerns. Online learning, in all of its forms, captures a treasure trove of student data. Who owns the data and to what ends may it be used? Can private student information be sold for commercial purposes, with or without parental consent? What educational decisions are being made for students based on data that may or may not actually capture their achievement or abilities? In fact, some companies do use personal student data for marketing. A December 2017 letter from the\\xa0federal Education Department to Agora Cyber Charter Schools, an online chain owned by K12 Inc., ordered the company to stop violating federal privacy law by requiring parents who enroll their children to waive their rights to have their children 9s personal information protected from unrestricted disclosure and/or commercial use.

      "article": "[ MELBOURNE, Australia 4 At Lumineer Academy, a newly opened primary school in Williamstown, Australia, there is no homework. There are no classrooms, uniforms or traditional grades. , Instead, there are ccreator spaces, cblue-sky thinking sessions and cpitch decks. , If the school 4 furnished like a start-up with whiteboards and beanbag chairs 4 sounds like the idea of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, that 9s because it is. , That entrepreneur is Susan Wu, 44, an American who has been called one of the c[most influential women in technology](https://www.fastcompany.com/3017162/the-most-influential-women-in- technology-2010-susan-wu) and who has advised or invested in companies that include Twitter, Reddit and Stripe. , Ms. Wu and her team believe they are starting an education revolution. They say they have created a new model for teaching children, called [Luminaria](http://www.luminaria.org/), that promises to prepare them to become the architects of 4 rather than mere participants in 4 a future world. ,  cOur current school models were built 100-plus years ago for the Industrial Revolution, said Ms. Wu. cWhat they cared about were homogeneous factories that produced a template of a kind of worker. The world has changed. , Critics, however, see [Lumineer Academy](http://www.lumineer.edu.au/) as another in a series of [attempts by Silicon Valley](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/technology/tech-billionaires- education-zuckerberg-facebook-hastings.html) to apply the same techniques used to churn out successful apps to instead turn out successful children. , In the United States, as more tech executives have tried their hands at opening schools, education experts have debated, and in some cases warned about, the effects of [corporate money and influence](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/silicon-valley- baltimore-schools.html) pervading the classroom. , In recent years, schools and education programs have been founded by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla; Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; and Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce. , Despite glittering launches and promises to disrupt education, schools founded by tech executives have yet to demonstrate success. AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000. , Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school 9s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart. , Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools 4 nearly three times the rate of American children 4 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit. , Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education. , Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education 4 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria. , Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu 9s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school. ,  cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time, said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. cAlmost any problem space 4 no matter how different it is from the last 4 she seems to be able to tackle. , Lumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000. , Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.) , Classrooms in the school have been rebranded cstudios. There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working. , The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases. , Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums. ,  cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, 8This can 9t be true, 9 said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they 9re quite prescriptive. , Ms. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn 9t joined Ms. Wu 9s school. ,  cI felt like I was too restricted, she said. cI couldn 9t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them. , There is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school. In one studio, 8- and 9-year-olds worked on a project about socializing. The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up 9s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch. , Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas. ,  cI was kind of impressed with the number of clich\\xe9s and buzzwords that they packed into a short amount of marketing copy, said Audrey Watters, whose blog, [Hack Education](http://hackeducation.com/), analyzes the intersection of education and tech. cIn the case of Luminaria, they have everything, they have all the buzzwords: social and emotional learning, mind- sets, grit, S.T.E.M., mindfulness, authentic learning, global consciousness. I mean, pick two of those. , Glenn Savage, an Australian education policy expert, said that it was difficult to see how the school 9s lofty goals could fit within Australia 9s cvery structured education system. ,  cIt 9s important that parents don 9t work on the false assumption that sending students to a school that claims to do things radically different means that the students won 9t be doing anything like students in other schools 4 because that 9s just not the case, he said. , One wall at the school displayed students 9 work with the [Asylum Seeker](https://www.asrc.org.au/)[ Resource Center](https://www.asrc.org.au/), a nonprofit organization that assists refugees hoping to resettle in Australia. , The students had created a cpitch deck 4 tech jargon for a PowerPoint presentation 4 aimed at persuading the group to collaborate with them on a project (it worked). In a nearby ccreator space, students were working to build a profitable micro-farm. They have been assigned to grow and sell goods at the local farmers 9 market by the end of the school year. , One student, Ines Morgan, 8, said she particularly liked a project in which her class observed an ant colony. ,  cOur hypothesis was, 8What happens when an ant colony gets disrupted? 9 she explained. cThey lived in chaos for like a day or two, but then, a few days later, they stuck together and just all decided to rebuild again. , The school 9s website promises to remove the cstress and anxiety students encounter at other schools. , But if students are shielded from emotional adversity in their early years, critics say, they may struggle to cope when they reach high school 4 where desks, traditional teaching methods and puberty await. , Ines, the 8-year-old ant colony disrupter, said she had seen ca little bit of bullying but that it was dealt with as a collective. , When asked how the situation was resolved, another student, Noah Helu, 8, said, cWell, it 9s like what Ines learned about the ant colony: Sticking together helped us stop the bullying. ] ",

The local authority said other cuts being considered would affect services such as behaviour support and English as an additional language. The details are in a letter sent from the council to head teachers. In a statement, Highland Council said a \"wide range of proposals\" were being considered to help it make savings. The local authority's Independent-Lib Dem-Labour administration is having to tackle an estimated budget gap of \\xa325.8m in the coming financial year due what it what it calls the \"scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years\".     Cuts 'appalling' SNP councillor and former Dingwall Academy rector, Graham MacKenzie, has described the council's proposed cuts as \"appalling\" and said they would \"worsen\" the attainment gap in the Highlands. Teaching union the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said it would be concerned if the council pushed ahead with the proposals. In the letter, the council said reductions in additional support needs teachers and pupil support assistants had been proposed. However, it added that vacancies and the turnover in these roles were \"likely to protect all those presently in post\". Also proposed is a reduction in specialist additional support services, excluding NHS Highland-funded services. The letter said: \"This is likely to impact in educational psychology, behaviour support, English as an additional language, interrupted learning, autism, assistive technology, and pre-school support services.\" About 40 teaching posts could also be cut. This would affect medium-sized and larger secondary schools.  'Remain committed' Other possible savings outlined include having fewer crossing patrol personnel and \"significantly\" reducing funding to Inverness' Eden Court Theatre and to High Life Highland, which operates council-owned leisure centres, museums and libraries. The proposals will be considered by councillors on 15 February. In its statement, Highland Council said: \"We have managed to protect education in previous years, and there were no new saving measures for schools last year. \"But the scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years means it is no longer possible to sustain that level of protection. \"We remain committed to supporting education and maintaining teacher numbers as far as we can, and especially for primary schools and rural communities.\" It added \"Other councils have made savings on additional need services in previous years, and we are now having to consider that. \"Other than this, there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in 90% of Highland schools, as we will protect all primary schools and our smaller secondary schools.\" Alistair Bell, Highlands secretary of the EIS, said that while the details set out in the letter were only proposals at this stage they were still a cause for concern. He told BBC Radio Scotland: \"If this is what is going to happen it is a grave situation for what is already a stretched service. \"At a time when the Scottish government is asking teachers in schools to bridge the attainment gap, this can only hinder that process.\"  ] ",

      "article": "[  The Czech Republic is deciding whether to re-elect pro-Russian President Milos Zeman for a second term or replace him with career academic Jiri Drahos, who has pledged to strengthen the country 9s ties with its allies in the European Union and NATO. Zeman, 73, is a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an early fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and campaigned by warning against Muslim migrants in a country with tiny religious minorities. His challenger, a 68 -year-old chemistry professor, vowed to creturn dignity to the post, a reference to Zeman 9s frequent clashes with media and political rivals. Opinion polls signaled a close race before the two-day runoff. Voting will resume at 8 a.m. and last until 2 p.m. Saturday, with results expected in the afternoon. The Czech Republic boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU, the lowest unemployment in the bloc and the highest living standards among its post-communist members. Still, Zeman has tapped anti-establishment sentiment that boosted populist politicians that challenged the EU 9s liberal, multi-cultural values elsewhere across the continent in elections last year. While the president has a largely ceremonial role, the post serves as an influential voice in public debate.      cCzech society is very divided, said Balazs Jarabik, a scholar at Carnegie Europe. cThe urban elites should show a bit more understanding toward rural voters. They really do have totally different possibilities. And the differences are only growing. ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ3Z.QCPsoL4/v0/60x-1.jpg) Jiri Drahos, left, and Milos Zeman during a television debate on Jan. 23.

Zeman has already pledged to give Babis a second [chance](/news/terminal/P2Z5U5SYF01S \"Czech President Zeman Sticks to Plan to Name Babis Premier Again\") to form a cabinet regardless of the outcome of the presidential election. Babis and his ANO party endorsed the incumbent before the presidential election.

Critics say his pro-Russian and anti-migrant rhetoric, jokes about killing journalists, vegetarians and teetotalers and his support of extremist political forces including a far-right party that advocates leaving the EU, have undermined the authority of the presidency. Zeman calls himself a euro-federalist, but he also suggested that Czech Republic should hold a Brexit-style referendum to leave the EU. He said he 9d vote to stay in although people should have a choice.     During the campaign, the incumbent accused Drahos of being soft on refugees. His supporters ran a full-page add in Pravo newspaper on Thursday that said cStop the migrants and Drahos. This country is ours.

Four of seven targets to improve disadvantage aren 9t being met, which is still the best result since 2011, the government 9s annual [Closing the Gap report](https://closingthegap.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/ctg- report-2018.pdf?a=1 \"Link to Report\") on Monday showed.

The poor majority should vote to tax the rich and divide the proceeds among themselves. But that 9s not happening in the United States. In fact, inequality has been rising for decades. Scholars suggest various [explanations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/opinion/democracy- inequality-thomas-piketty.html). Here 9s one possibility that few have discussed: Poor voters may oppose a policy of higher taxes and income transfers because they wrongly think they 9ll be victims of it.  Defying logic The idea that in democracies the poor soak the rich goes back to [Aristotle](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.3.three.html). The economists Allan Meltzer and Scott Richard [formalized](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261013) the logic in a classic paper. If the majority gets to set a flat tax rate and share the revenue equally among all voters, then when incomes are especially unequal, the majority should set the rate higher. But in the United States, things haven 9t worked out that way. Rather than expropriating the wealthy, low-income voters in several swing states helped put a [billionaire](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/01/the- full-list-of-every-american-billionaire-2016/4bcce2ee37ac) in the White House who then slashed taxes on the rich. As Nicholas Carnes and Noam Lupu showed [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/05/its-time- to-bust-the-myth-most-trump-voters-were-not-working-class/) last year, polls suggest most Trump voters had above-average income. But the crucial states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania all [saw](http://www.weeklystandard.com /the-election-came-down-to-77744-votes-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-and-michigan- updated/article/2005323) big drops in the share of low-income voters supporting the Democratic candidate. Had large minorities of the poor not backed Trump in these states, Hillary Clinton would have won. Why don 9t poor Americans use their voting power to shrink the income gap? Some observers blame the [Democratic Party](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871547651?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0871547651) for abandoning blue-collar workers to cater to educated elites. Others see the influence of [racial](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FKRXYV4?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B01FKRXYV4) divisions or the power of [tycoons](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/11/us/politics/2016 -presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html) and lobbyists to distort the agenda. These factors may well contribute. But there 9s another piece to the puzzle.  What you don 9t know can hurt you In a recent article, Vladimir Gimpelson and I [show](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract) that in many countries 4 the United States included 4 most people simply don 9t know how high inequality is or where they fall in the distribution. Nor can they say reliably how it 9s been changing. _[[ Here 9s how little Americans have learned about Donald Trump ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/21/heres-how- little-americans-have-learned-about-donald-trump)]_ On many different surveys, answering a range of questions, the average respondent guesses right about inequality only slightly more often than chance. Respondents do a little better in rich countries than in poor ones 4 but not by much. For a citizen to judge how redistribution will affect her, she needs to know how her income compares to those of others. Is she among the rich who pay more in taxes than they get back from public programs 4 or the poor, who come out ahead? Many don 9t know. In 2015, Ipsos MORI asked respondents in 28 countries to guess the average annual wage. That year in the United States, the correct answer was around $59,000, according to the [OECD](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=AV_AN_WAGE). The average guess was less than half that 4 about [$26,000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract). (Even if we suppose respondents had in mind post-tax not pretax income, the guesses were way too low.) Another survey in 2007 asked Americans about average household [income](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168014545414). The median respondent guessed $40,000. According to the Census Bureau, average household income that year was [$69,193](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_07_1YR_S1901&prodType=table) 4 again, much higher than the typical answer. _[[ You need two things for a successful anti-violence movement. Post-Parkland activism about guns has both. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey- cage/wp/2018/02/23/why-neveragain-is-different-from-earlier-movements-against- gun-violence)]_ Suppose that 4 as the Meltzer-Richard theory predicts 4 those with below average wages or favor income redistribution while those with higher wages or income oppose it. Clearly, a lot of Americans who fall below the true average think they are above it. That implies that many who would benefit from redistribution wrongly think that they would lose.  The Lake Wobegon effect This fits with another common bias. People tend to think they are closer to the middle of the income distribution than they actually are. As in Garrison Keillor 9s [fictional town](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/garrison_keillor_137097) where all children are above average, residents of many countries like to think they are close to the mean. The poor underestimate how much the rich earn, while the rich underestimate the poverty of the poor. Some misperceptions appear extreme. For instance, among the 5 percent of U.K. respondents who said they or their family owned two homes, a whopping 40 percent thought they were in the bottom half of the income distribution. Meanwhile, 19 percent of Americans who said they had coften or csometimes gone without enough food in the previous year placed themselves 4 implausibly 4 in the _highest_ -earning half. Across countries, actual levels of inequality bear little relation to the percentage who think government should reduce the income gap. But the level of inequality citizens [perceive](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract) correlates strongly with demand for more redistribution. If people are misinformed, would education solve the problem? Not necessarily. Some research suggests people resist changing their minds even when confronted with contrary facts. For instance, [Eric Lawrence and John Sides](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168014545414) found that respondents, even after learning average income was higher than they had thought, were no readier to support aid to the poor or job training programs. [Ilyana Kuziemko, Michael Norton, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360), using an online survey, randomized whether respondents received information about inequality, but found this had little or no effect on their attitudes toward income tax rates and transfer programs. The source of information matters. People are readier to believe a message when it comes from a person 4 or political party 4 that usually argues the [opposite](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal- of-political-science/article/rumors-and-health-care-reform-experiments-in- political-misinformation/8B88568CD057242D2D97649300215CF2). If Republicans said inequality was too high and advocated aid to the poor, that would get attention. Of course, that 9s unlikely to happen. All parties portray reality in ways that serve their base. Wealth may be different. Unlike with income, Americans [overestimate](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2017-07/ipsos-perils- of-perception-charts-2015.pdf) the asset share of the top 1 percent. And attitudes toward the estate tax seem more responsive to facts. Telling respondents how few Americans are subject to it 4 less than [1 percent](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360) 4 increases the share that support the estate tax (by [11](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X15610190) percentage points) and that favor raising its rate (by [36](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360) percentage points). Misperceptions are certainly not the only reason poor Americans resist higher taxes to pay for programs that would benefit them. Culture, racial prejudice and political messaging also contribute. But the desire of millions to see themselves as more or less average may help explain why they don 9t use their voting power to shape public policies in their interest. _[Daniel Treisman](https://www.danieltreisman.org/) is a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles. _ ] ",

The [Brilliant Club](http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/) is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal. In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15. In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.  University gap This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.     Image caption Pupils get extra lessons with postgraduate students, showing them university is in reach  The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%. Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome. In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and \"classrooms fit for purpose\". In Philippi, she says: \"The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT [information and communications technology]. \"With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa.\" Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.  Image caption Putting young people in the frame for university  While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the \"academic and social skills\" needed to complete their degrees. But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons. The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking. In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and see, perhaps for the first time, what it's like to be a student and to show that it's an accessible target.  Unequal chances It's a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.  Image caption When pupils complete the course, they go on a visit to university to find about life as a student  University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education. Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year. But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered. Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university. \"Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement,\" says the impact report on AccessEd's pilot phase. But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [Liberia's big school experiment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Helping to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * [Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * [Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * [The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * [From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * [Terror survivor campaigns for open speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

The move has been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney in a bid to tackle a recruitment crisis in the profession. The Scottish government said it was providing \\xa31.3m to create hundreds more opportunities for people to qualify as teachers. Edinburgh's Queen Margaret and Napier universities will train new recruits from 2019. Mr Swinney said the government was addressing difficulties recruiting classroom staff and he hoped this would \"build capacity within teacher education\".    It comes as the EIS teaching union warned schools are facing a recruitment \"crisis\" - with this one of the reasons why they are demanding a 10% wage rise for teachers.  'Raising standards' Edinburgh Napier University will initially offer a total of 30 places on a one-year Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) course - which allows those who already have a degree to train as teachers - with a focus on maths and sciences. It is planned to expand that into areas such as English and computing, with up to 150 training places after three years. Queen Margaret University will recruit up to 120 students to an undergraduate primary course but will also have 20 places on a PGDE course for those who wish to be home economics teachers.  Image caption The move could create hundreds of new teachers  Mr Swinney said: \"Teachers have a key role to play in helping us raise standards and close the attainment gap. That is why we are doing everything we can to attract talented and enthusiastic people to the profession. \"We recognise that, in common with many other countries, it is hard to recruit teachers in the numbers we need, particularly in certain specialist subjects. \"Adding two additional universities to the institutions that offer initial teacher education, supported by \\xa31.3 million investment from the Scottish Government, means we can not only recruit additional teachers to take up post within the next two years but build capacity within teacher education. \"The two new teacher training courses offer more choice and flexibility for anyone considering teaching as a career, especially in the specialist home economic and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects where we know there are shortages at the moment.\"  'By teachers, for teachers' Kenneth Muir, chief executive and registrar of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, hailed the move as a \"landmark development in the provision of initial teacher education\". He added: \"We must continue to adapt to ensure we do not miss out to other professions on new, high quality teaching talent. \"It is important that high standards are maintained and we will ensure the courses offered by QMU and Napier universities satisfy fully our accreditation criteria.\" Alistair Sambell, vice principal and deputy vice chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, said: \"Our new teacher education programme will be designed by teachers, for teachers. \"As a university we have an applied approach to learning, and student placements in schools will be underpinned by practice-based learning in class, supported by practising teachers.\" Prof Petra Wend, principal of Queen Margaret University, added: \"Teacher education at QMU will offer research-informed, practice-based programmes developed in collaboration with professionals from the sector and inspired by the needs of Scottish children and schools today.\"  ] ",

Just like in any other discipline, English teachers have way more curriculum than we can cover in a year.\\xa0 Time constraints force educators to prioritize by order of what feels most important, and all too often that importance is determined by what 9s going to be on the test. Our students pay the price as activities that cultivate essential real-world skills such as collaboration and creativity and provide them with a much more engaging and well-rounded education are eliminated from their classes. Educators are under enormous pressures stemming from a data-driven culture most recently rooted in No Child Left Behind and its successor, the Every Student Succeeds Act, in which the ultimate measure of professional and academic success is a standardized test score. As a result of this standardized testing culture, many of our English students spend way too much time reading random passages which are completely detached from their lives and answering multiple choice questions in an attempt to improve test results.\\xa0 In many classrooms, writing has become [little more than an afterthought](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.d0ecfaa28732). Creative writing, in particular, is seen by some as a frivolous waste of time because its value is so difficult to justify with data. _[[ Teacher: What happened when I stopped viewing my students as data points ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/10/11/teacher-what- happened-when-i-stopped-viewing-my-students-as-data- points/?utm_term=.e96d3c779c3f)]_ Two decades before the advent of No Child Left Behind, the research of influential literacy professor Gail Tompkins [identified seven compelling reasons](https://www.ericdigests.org/1996-3/writing.htm) why children should spend time writing creatively in class: _\\xa0_  * to entertain  * to foster artistic expression  * to explore the functions and values of writing  * to stimulate imagination  * to clarify thinking  * to search for identity  * to learn to read and write The majority of Tompkins 9s outcomes of creative writing could never be measured on today 9s standardized tests.\\xa0 Indeed, over the same period that standardized reading tests have pushed writing in English classes to the sidelines, efforts to evaluate student writing on a broad, systematic scale have dwindled.\\xa0 Measuring student writing is expensive, and accurately assessing abstract thinking requires human resources most states aren 9t willing to pony up.\\xa0 It 9s much cheaper to score a bubble sheet. Measurement and assessment aside, the soft skills that we cultivate through regular creative writing with our students have tremendous real-world application as well as helping to promote the kind of atmosphere we want in our classrooms.\\xa0 After many years as an English teacher, I 9ve found that carving out regular time for creative writing in class provides benefits for me and my students that we simply don 9t get from other activities. One of the benefits of creative writing in the classroom is how engaging it is for our students.\\xa0 In general, much of our curriculum follows a one-size- fits-all design and allows little room for freedom of exploration. For young people who are at a time in life when many of their decisions are made for them, this lack of power can be very demotivating and can negatively impact their interest and effort.\\xa0 To do their best work, students need to feel that school is about them, and they need to feel connected to the content on a personal level.\\xa0\\xa0 When students are given opportunities to experiment with their voices and create through their own original work, they feel a sense of place and they are able to feel in charge.\\xa0 That 9s when they shine. A former student and talented writer told me the following about her relationship with creative writing in the classroom: _\\xa0_ > Creative writing is important to me because it gives me a way to express myself. There are not a lot of ways, as a young teenager, to be able to freely express ideas and emotions. Many are personal feelings you wouldn 9t really want to share with others. But in writing you can put all of those mixed emotions into words. Next thing you know, you 9ve created an entirely different universe, with characters close to your heart. Everything is under your complete control. That is not something that you can experience in reality, even reading a book. The feeling that you have created something, something that you can call your own, is what makes it incredible. When we empower our students to create something that is only theirs, to make big choices in their writing, it can transform attitudes toward learning and school in general.\\xa0 Having students who are motivated to work to their full potential is a dream scenario for any teacher.\\xa0 Regular creative writing can help us to move in that direction. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8K3M3Vh_C9VYIHxPNgEqX578qqg=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLU33FNQF44V5K3LVOOELH333A.jpg)  Another very real benefit of creative writing in the classroom is that it can help to develop a sense of community among our students.\\xa0 In our bitterly polarized society, any activity that fosters empathy and collaboration is well worth our time. Students can share writing with each other at the drafting phase, working together to hone their individual stories.\\xa0 This teamwork allows our students to support each other and work to understand each other 9s perspectives.\\xa0 In addition to peer editing, having students co-author creative pieces, whether as an informal cchain story type activity or a longer, more polished product, can go a long way in nurturing the skills required for effective partnership.\\xa0 Sharing responsibility in the creative process serves as a powerful motivator for our students, often leading to better quality writing. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tyjx1BVSC7AUFaJhbM_lDgsVNsY=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GGVJHNNS4QZ2ZM7BOHLJD652LY.jpg)  It 9s unlikely that our English teachers are going to get the additional time they so desperately need.\\xa0 What we 9re left with is the task of prioritizing class content in such a way that we 9re truly meeting all the needs of our students. Data is an important tool in helping us to measure how well we 9re meeting those needs, but our definition of data must be broad enough to include outcomes that can 9t be captured with a standardized test.\\xa0 We must trust our English teachers to plan instruction that is in the best interests of their students and to know when they 9ve succeeded. As a regular part of that instruction, creative writing can empower our students and give them ownership so critical to their motivation.\\xa0 It can provide them essential practice at partnering with their peers in a world where more effective collaboration is sorely needed. At its most powerful, creative writing can help turn our English courses into the life-changing experience that all educators want their classes to be. ] ",

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) The latest flap surrounding Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stems from her inability to answer basic questions about schools during an interview she gave to Lesley Stahl on CBS 9s c60 Minutes on Sunday night. But it wasn 9t the first time she has revealed a lack of knowledge about fundamental education issues in front of a big audience 4 or said something that infuriated advocates of public schools. Here are nine things DeVos has said 4 or refused to say 4 in recent years that explain her views and philosophy about education in the United States: **1)** In 2015, before she became education secretary in the administration of President Trump, she said flatly that traditional public schools are ca dead end. That encapsulates the longtime view that DeVos has held 4 and spent decades advocating. She and her husband, Amway heir Richard DeVos, have spent time and money on school choice advocacy for decades. They were instrumental in pushing through Michigan 9s charter school law in 1993, and they support programs that use public money for private and religious school tuition 4 a position that critics say shows her desire to privatize U.S. public education. As education secretary, DeVos has said repeatedly that her definition of holding school districts caccountable d\\xa0is how many alternatives to traditional public schools they offer to families. Here 9s a quote from a speech she gave at the 2015 SXSW EDU convention in Austin: > We are the beneficiaries of start-ups, ventures, and innovation in every other area of life, but we don 9t have that in education because it 9s a closed system, a closed industry, a closed market. It 9s a monopoly, a dead end. And the best and brightest innovators and risk-takers steer way clear of it. As long as education remains a closed system, we will never see the education equivalents of Google, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, Wikipedia or Uber. We won 9t see any real innovation that benefits more than a handful of students. **2)** Then there was the infamous comment she made about schools and guns and bears. During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked\\xa0whether DeVos would agree that guns don 9t belong in schools. She said: > cI will refer back to Sen. [Mike] Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies. That statement is often held up as an example of her inability to articulate an answer to a question in a setting where many expected her to be more prepared, such as her confirmation hearing or her c60 Minutes interview. When the Senate voted in February 2017 to confirm her as education secretary, she became the first Cabinet nominee in history to need a vice president, in this case Mike Pence, to break a tie. That underscored her status as the most controversial in a pool of controversial Trump nominees. _[[ Six astonishing things Betsy DeVos said 4 and refused to say 4 at her confirmation hearing ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/01/18/six-astonishing-things-betsy-devos-said-and-refused-to- say-at-her-confirmation-hearing/?utm_term=.d96738a0a0b4)]_ **3)** Just three weeks after becoming education secretary, DeVos displayed her unwavering focus on school choice 4 and a misunderstanding of the history of historically black colleges and universities by calling these institutions cpioneers of cschool choice. Actually, black students were barred from white institutions and had no choice but to go to schools specifically created for them. Here 9s what the statement said in part: > cThey started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn 9t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. She later walked back the cpioneers of cschool choice notion in a series of tweets. **4)\\xa0** She has refused to say whether the federal government should prevent private schools that accept public money from discriminating against some students. She said it was up to the states. At a May 2017 budget hearing before the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, Rep. Katherine M. Clark\\xa0(D-Mass.) said\\xa0one private school in Indiana that accepts publicly funded vouchers maintains it may deny admission to LGBT students or those coming from families with chomosexual or bisexual activity. Clark asked DeVos whether she would tell the state of Indiana it could not discriminate\\xa0that way if it accepted federal funding, and she asked DeVos what she would say if a voucher school rejected African American students but a state csaid it was okay. DeVos responded: cWell again, the Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX protections are broadly applicable across the board, but when it comes to parents making choices on behalf of their students. . . Clark interrupted and said, cThis isn 9t about parents making choices; this is about the use of federal dollars. Is there any situation? Would you say to Indiana, that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars? Or would you say the state has the flexibility? DeVos said: cI believe states should continue to have flexibility in putting together programs . . . _[[ Five startling things Betsy DeVos just told Congress ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/24/five- startling-things-betsy-devos-just-told-congress/?utm_term=.2923e7fe99f8)]_ **5)** And she repeatedly disparages people who disagree with her views (though she isn 9t the first U.S. education secretary to do). At a May 2017 speech she gave in Indianapolis to the American Federation for Children 9s National Policy Summit,\\xa0an organization promoting school choice that\\xa0she founded and led, DeVos said: > cIn order to succeed, education must commit to excellence and innovation to better meet the needs of individual students. Defenders of our current system have regularly been resistant to any meaningful change. In resisting, these 8flat-Earthers 9 have chilled creativity and stopped American kids from competing at the highest levels. Our current framework is a closed system that relies on one-size-fits-all solutions. We need an open system that envelopes choices and embraces the future. **6)** Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord on June 1, and DeVos issued a statement applauding the move. When reporters asked her a few days later about her views on climate change, she responded: > cCertainly, the climate changes. Yes. Not only was that an example of her refusal to directly answer many questions, but it also suggested\\xa0the U.S. education secretary supports Trump 9s view that human-caused climate change is not real 4 despite\\xa0overwhelming scientific evidence that it is. **7)** During her interview with Stahl on c60 Minutes, DeVos acknowledged she had never cintentionally visited a low-performing traditional public school, and she made this unusual statement: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Here 9s part of the conversation about what happens to underperforming traditional public schools when children leave for alternatives and take funding with them: > STAHL: cWhy take away money from that school that 9s not working 4 to bring them up to a level where they are,\\xa0that school is working? > > DEVOS: cWell, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school, school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. > > STAHL: cOkay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that 9s not working? What about those kids? > > DEVOS: cWell, in places where there have been, where there is, a lot of choice that 9s been introduced, Florida, for example, the studies show that when there 9s a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually, the results get better, as well. > > STAHL: cNow, has that happened in Michigan? We 9re in Michigan. This is your home state. > > DEVOS: cYes, well, there 9s lots of great options and choices for students here. > > STAHL: cHave the public schools in Michigan gotten better? > > DEVOS: cI don 9t know. Overall, I, I can 9t say overall that they have all gotten better. > > STAHL: cThe whole state is not doing well. > > DEVOS: cWell, there are certainly lots of pockets where this, the students are doing well and . . . > > STAHL: cNo, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. > > DEVOS: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. > > STAHL: cThe public schools here are doing worse than they did. > > DEVOS: cMichigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. > > STAHL: cHave you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they 9re doing? > > DEVOS: cI have not, I have not, I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. > > STAHL: cMaybe you should. > > DEVOS: cMaybe I should. Yes. **8)** At her 2017 confirmation hearing before the Senate panel, DeVos seemed not to understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. DeVos said states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it. > HASSAN: cDo you stand by your statement a few minutes ago that [IDEA] should be up to the states whether to follow it? > > DEVOS: cFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play. > > HASSAN: cSo were you unaware, when I just asked you about the IDEA, that it was a federal law? > > DEVOS: cI may have confused it. She did confuse it in a most fundamental way. **9)** In 2017, DeVos rescinded Obama-era Title IX guidelines on how schools should handle allegations of sexual assault. Saying that too many men were falsely accused, she set new rules making it harder for accusers to prove their accusations. During [a Sept. 7 speech on the subject](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/12 /education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60-minutes- interview/?utm_term=.5329f9e47b6d), she said: > cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. Actually, survivors had pleaded with her not to change the rules, saying the Obama regulations gave them a voice they did not previously have. Many were furious at her decision. ] ",

(Screen shot by The Washington Post) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered her first speech of 2018 and flatly declared that school reform efforts under\\xa0Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had not worked 4 nor had any other reform effort by any education secretary. She also said\\xa0the establishment of the Education Department by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 was essentially a cgiant nod to union bosses. DeVos gave a keynote address at the American Enterprise Institute 9s conference titled cBush-Obama School Reform: Lessons Learned, and then answered questions from Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the conservative think tank. Here are some things she said 4 and didn 9t say 4 in her speech and in her conversation with Hess, followed by the text of the speech: **DeVOS :** > The federal-first approach did not start with No Child Left Behind. The push for higher national standards was present in the Clinton administration 9s cGoals 2000 initiative. Before that, we had President George H.W. Bush 9s cAmerica 2000, also calling for higher national standards. These followed the Reagan administration 9s cNation at Risk report, released in 1983. That report gave dire warnings about the country 9s track if education was not reformed. cIf an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, the report warned, cwe might well have viewed it as an act of war. That came after President Carter 9s giant nod to union bosses: the establishment of the Department of Education, with the ironic charge to cprohibit federal control of education. . . . > We saw two presidents [George W. Bush and Obama] from different political parties and philosophies take two different approaches. Federally mandated assessments. Federal money. Federal standards. All originated in Washington, and none solved the problem. Too many of America 9s students are still unprepared. When Hess asked her if there was a single Obama or Bush school reform initiative that was successful, she said she couldn 9t think of one. What she didn 9t say was that the school reform she supports 4 the wide expansion of school choice in the form of charter schools and programs that use public money for private schools 4 has not shown to be a solution to the problems she says plague U.S. schools.  4 **DEVOS:** > Most teachers feel they have little 4 if any 4 say in their own classrooms.\\xa0 That statistic should shock even the most ardent sycophant of cthe system. It 9s yet another reason why we should shift power over classrooms from Washington back to teachers who know their students well. Federal mandates distort what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. . . . > > Let 9s trust teachers, too. Let 9s encourage them to innovate, to create new options for students. Not just with public charter schools or magnet schools or private schools, but within the traditional csystem and with new approaches yet to be explored. She didn 9t mention that she has done nothing to empower teachers but instead has supported efforts to diminish the role of their unions, which provide due-process rights. In the speech, in fact, she takes a few potshots at the teachers unions, calling them cChicken Littles, even though early in the talk she promised not to cimpugn anyone 9s motives or to do any cfingerpointing. Her comment is clearly about traditional public schools, and she doesn 9t mention that teachers in many charter schools also don 9t feel as if they have any say in their own classrooms.  4 **DEVOS:** > I agree 4 and have always agreed 4 with President Trump on this: cCommon Core is a disaster. And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead. What she didn 9t say was that the Common Core State Standards, while dead at her department, are not dead in most states, even if the name of the standards has been changed in some of states.\\xa0[A November 2017 report by Achieve](https://www.achieve.org/state-standards-remain-strong), an education organization that was involved with the creation of the standards, analyzed state standards and found that the essence of the Core standards in English language arts and math still stand in most states. At least in this speech she didn 9t say 4 as she and President Trump have in the past 4 that they would kill the Common Core. The federal government can 9t do that; it 9s up to state officials.  4 **DEVOS:** > Our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. They deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced and challenging life-long learning journey. Schools should be open to all students 4 no matter where they 9re growing up or how much their parents make. > > That means no more discrimination based upon Zip code or socio-economic status. All means all. > > It 9s about educational freedom! Freedom from Washington mandates. Freedom from centralized control. Freedom from a one-size-fits-all mentality. Freedom from cthe system. What she didn 9t say is what she said more plainly in 2015 and implied here: that the traditional public education system is ca dead end. _[[ To Trump 9s education pick, the U.S. public school system is a 8dead end 9 ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2016/12/21/to-trumps-education-pick-the-u-s-public-school-system-is-a -dead-end/?utm_term=.294bacec0aba)]_ _[[ How Betsy DeVos has mastered the art of the non-answer ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/06/03/how-betsy- devos-has-mastered-the-art-of-the-non-answer/?utm_term=.fb022a42934e)]_ **Here 9s the text of the speech as prepared for delivery and provided by the U.S. Education Department. She refers to Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, and AEI research fellow Michael Q. McShane.  ** > Thank you, Rick, for that kind introduction. Who would 9ve thought that after we were last together on a panel in Grand Rapids a couple of years ago, I 9d be here in this capacity today? > > It 9s an honor to be with all of you at an organization I have long appreciated. AEI is now in its 80th year and in that near century, the Institute 9s scholars have influenced and shaped the way Americans think about so many issues in the public square. AEI has been 4 and will continue to be 4 a treasured constant in this town of transition. And it should be noted that 9s due in no small part to the leadership of Arthur Brooks, who brings a unique and compelling perspective. I 9m grateful to call him a friend. > > I 9d like to especially thank Rick and Michael for putting this volume together and for hosting today 9s important discussions. Both of you have contributed significantly to the policy debates in American education, and, importantly, you 9ve put your distinct perspectives and experience to work with the goal of improving education for all. You both left the classroom out of frustration, and there are still far too many teachers who share that experience today. > > My work over thirty years has revolved around time spent on the outside, looking in. Outside Washington. Outside the LBJ building. Outside cthe system. Some have questioned the presence of an outsider in the Department of Education, but, as it 9s been said before, maybe what students need is someone who doesn 9t yet know all the things you ccan 9t do. > > To a casual observer, a classroom today looks scarcely different than what one looked like when I entered the public policy debate thirty years ago. Worse, most classrooms today look remarkably similar to those of 1938 when AEI was founded. Take a look at this! [She shows some slides.] These two operating rooms look starkly different, as does this general store and this website. But these two classrooms look almost identical. > > The vast majority of learning environments have remained the same since the industrial revolution, because they were made in its image. Think of your own experience: sit down; don 9t talk; eyes front. Wait for the bell. Walk to the next class. Repeat. Students were trained for the assembly line then, and they still are today. > > Our societies and economies have moved beyond the industrial era. But the data tell us education hasn 9t. > > The most recent Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, report, with which you are all familiar, has the U.S. ranked 23rd in reading, 25th in science and 40th in math. And, you know this too: it 9s not for a lack of funding. The fact is the United States spends more per pupil than most other developed countries, many of which perform better than us in the same surveys. > > I know that hard truth touches a nerve for everyone in this room. It does so for educators who try to help their students realize their potential. For employers who seek prepared employees. And, most importantly, for parents who only want the best for their children. > > Of course there have been many attempts to change the status quo. We 9ve seen valiant efforts to improve education from Republicans and Democrats, liberals, conservatives and everyone in between. > > That 9s because everyone is aiming for the same result. > > Everyone wants students to be prepared and to lead successful lives. > > We can 9t say that sort of public harmony exists in other policy arenas. Not everyone agrees about the outcome or goal of tax policy or energy policy or immigration policy. > > Our unity of purpose here presents an opportunity. > > But while we 9ve changed some aspects of education, the results we all work for and desire haven 9t been achieved. > > The bottom line is simple: federal education reform efforts have not worked as hoped. > > That 9s not a point I make lightly or joyfully. Yes, there have been some minor improvements in a few areas. But we 9re far from where we need to be. We need to be honest with ourselves. The purpose of today 9s conversation is to look at the past with 20/20 hindsight, examine what we have done and where it has 4 or hasn 9t 4 led us. > > First, let me be clear that I 9m not here to impugn anyone 9s motives. Every one of us wants better for students. We want better for our own children. We want better for our communities and our country. We won 9t solve any problems through finger-pointing. > > I also don 9t intend to criticize the goals of previous administrations 9 education initiatives. In the end, every administration has tried to improve education for students and grow the number who are learning valuable skills. > > We should hope 3 no, we should commit 3 that we as a country will not rest until every single child has equal access to the quality education they deserve. Secretary Spellings was right to ask cwhose child do you want to leave behind? > > But the question remains: why, after all the good intentions, the worthwhile goals, the wealth of expertise mustered, and the billions and billions of dollars spent, are students still unprepared? > > With No Child Left Behind, the general consensus among federal policymakers was that greater accountability would lead to better schools. Highlighting America 9s education woes had become an American pastime, and, they thought, surely if schools were forced to answer for their failures, students would ultimately be better off. > > President Bush, the ccompassionate conservative, and Senator Kennedy, the cliberal lion, both worked together on the law. It said that schools had to meet ambitious goals\\u2026 or else. Lawmakers mandated that 100 percent of students attain proficiency by 2014. This approach would keep schools accountable and ultimately graduate more and better-educated students, they believed. > > Turns out, it didn 9t. Indeed, as has been detailed today, NCLB did little to spark higher scores. Universal proficiency, touted at the law 9s passage, was not achieved. As states and districts scrambled to avoid the law 9s sanctions and maintain their federal funding, some resorted to focusing specifically on math and reading at the expense of other subjects. Others simply inflated scores or lowered standards. > > The trend line remains troubling today. According to the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress data, two-thirds of American fourth graders still can 9t read at the level they should. And since 2013, our 8th grade reading scores have declined. > > Where the Bush administration emphasized NCLB 9s stick, the Obama administration focused on carrots. They recognized that states would not be able to legitimately meet the NCLB 9s strict standards. Secretary Duncan testified that 82 percent of the nation 9s schools would likely fail to meet the law 9s requirements 4 thus subjecting them to crippling sanctions. > > The Obama administration dangled billions of dollars through the cRace to the Top competition, and the grant-making process not so subtly encouraged states to adopt the Common Core State Standards. With a price tag of nearly four and a half billion dollars, it was billed as the clargest- ever federal investment in school reform. Later, the Department would give states a waiver from NCLB 9s requirements so long as they adopted the Obama administration 9s preferred policies 4 essentially making law while Congress negotiated the reauthorization of ESEA. > > Unsurprisingly, nearly every state accepted Common Core standards and applied for hundreds of millions of dollars in cRace to the Top funds. But despite this change, the United States 9 PISA performance did not improve in reading and science, and it dropped in math from 2012 to 2015. > > Then, rightly, came the public backlash to federally imposed tests and the Common Core. I agree 4 and have always agreed 4 with President Trump on this: cCommon Core is a disaster. And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead. > > On a parallel track, the Obama administration 9s School Improvement Grants sought to fix targeted schools by injecting them with cash. The total cost of that effort was seven billion dollars. > > One year ago this week, the Department 9s Institute of Education Sciences released a report on what came of all that spending. It said: cOverall, across all grades, we found that implementing any SIG-funded model had no significant impacts on math or reading test scores, high school graduation, or college enrollment. > > There we have it: billions of dollars directed at low-performing schools had no significant impact on student achievement. > > These investments were meant to spark meaningful reforms. Schools were encouraged to significantly alter their teaching staffs, fire the principal or change the structure and model of the school. But most glossed over those recommendations. They simply took the federal money and ran the school the same old way. > > So where does that leave us? We saw two presidents from different political parties and philosophies take two different approaches. > > Federally mandated assessments. Federal money. Federal standards. All originated in Washington, and none solved the problem. Too many of America 9s students are still unprepared. > > Perhaps the lesson lies not in what made the approaches different, but in what made them the same: the federal government. Both approaches had the same Washington cexperts telling educators how to behave. > > The lesson is in the false premise: that Washington knows what 9s best for educators, parents and students. > > Rick, you 9ve rightly pointed out that the federal government is good at making states, districts, and schools do something, but it 9s not good at making them do it well. Getting real results for students hinges on how that csomething is done. > > That 9s because when it comes to education 4 and any other issue in public life 4 those closest to the problem are always better able to solve it. Washington bureaucrats and self-styled education cexperts are about as far removed from students as you can get. > > Yet under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Washington overextended itself time and time again. > > Educators don 9t need engineering from Washington. Parents don 9t need prescriptions from Washington. Students don 9t need standards from Washington. > > Throughout both initiatives, the result was a further damaged classroom dynamic between teacher and student, as the focus shifted from comprehension to test-passing. This sadly has taken root, with the American Federation of Teachers recently finding that 60 percent of its teachers reported having moderate to no influence over the content and skills taught in their own classrooms. > > Let that sink in. Most teachers feel they have little 4 if any 4 say in their own classrooms. > > That statistic should shock even the most ardent sycophant of cthe system. It 9s yet another reason why we should shift power over classrooms from Washington back to teachers who know their students well. > > Federal mandates distort what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. > > Ideally, parent and teacher work together to help a child discover his or her potential and pursue his or her passions. When we seek to empower teachers, we must empower parents as well. Parents are too often powerless in deciding what 9s best for their child. The state mandates where to send their child. It mandates what their child learns and how he or she learns it. In the same way, educators are constrained by state mandates. District mandates. Building mandates . . . all kinds of other mandates! Educators don 9t need Washington mandating their teaching on top of everything else. > > But during the years covered in your volume, the focus was the opposite: more federal government intrusion into relationships between teachers, parents and children. > > The lessons of history should force us to admit that federal action has its limits. > > The federal-first approach did not start with No Child Left Behind. The push for higher national standards was present in the Clinton administration 9s cGoals 2000 initiative. Before that, we had President George H.W. Bush 9s cAmerica 2000, also calling for higher national standards. These followed the Reagan administration 9s cNation at Risk report, released in 1983.

That came after President Carter 9s giant nod to union bosses: the establishment of the Department of Education, with the ironic charge to cprohibit federal control of education. > > The trend is evident. Politicians from both parties just can 9t help themselves. They have talked about painting education in new colors and even broader strokes. But each time, reform has not fundamentally changed cthe system. Each attempt has really just been a new coat of paint on the same old wall. > > When we try the same thing over and over again, yet expect different results, that 9s not reform 3 that 9s insanity. > > We will not reach our goal of helping every child achieve his or her fullest potential until we truly change. Let me offer three ways we can move forward in that pursuit. > > First, we need to recognize that the federal government 9s appropriate role is not to be the nation 9s school board. My role is not to be the national superintendent nor the country 9s cchoice chief 4 regardless of what the union 9s cChicken Littles may say! Federal investments in education, after all, are less than 10 percent of total K-12 expenditures, but the burdens created by federal regulations in education amount to a much, much larger percentage. > > The Every Student Succeeds Act charted a path in a new direction. ESSA takes important steps to return power where it belongs by recognizing states 4 not Washington 4 should shape education policy around their own people. But state lawmakers should also resist the urge to centrally plan education. cLeave it to the states may be a compelling campaign-season slogan, but state capitols aren 9t exactly close to every family either. That 9s why states should empower teachers and parents and provide the same flexibility ESSA allows states. > > But let 9s recognize that many states are now struggling with what comes next. State ESSA plans aren 9t the finish line. Those words on paper mean very little if state and local leaders don 9t seize the opportunity to truly transform education. They must move past a mindset of compliance and embrace individual empowerment. > > Under ESSA, school leaders, educators and parents have the latitude and freedom to try new approaches to serve individual students. > > My message to them is simple: do it! > > Embrace the imperative to do something truly bold . . . to challenge the status quo . . . to break the mold. > > One important way to start this process is to make sure that parents get the information they want and need about the performance of their children 9s schools and teachers. ESSA encourages states to be transparent about how money is spent, down to the school-building level. > > Some states have developed information that is truly useful for parents and teachers. Others have worked just as hard to obfuscate what is really going on at their schools. To empower parents, policymakers and teachers, we can 9t let cthe system hide behind complexity to escape accountability. > > We must always push for better. > > ESSA is a good step in the right direction. But it 9s just that 4 a step. We still find ourselves boxed in a csystem, one where we are in a constant battle to move the ball between the 40-yard lines of a football field. Nobody scores, and nobody wins. Students are left bored in the bleachers, and many leave, never to return. > > So why don 9t we consider whether we need a new playbook? > > That brings me to point number two. And, to finish the analogy . . . let 9s call a new play: empowering parents. > > Parents have the greatest stake in the outcome of their child 9s education. Accordingly, they should also have the power to make sure their child is getting the right education. > > As Deven Carlson points out, there is little constituency in America for the top-down reforms that have been tried time and again. In order for any reform to truly work, it must attract and maintain the support of the people. > > I have seen such support for parental empowerment. The more parents exercise it, the more they like it. This growing support is why states are responding to that demand one by one. It 9s also why sycophants entrenched in and defending the status quo are terrified. They recoil from relinquishing power and control to teachers, parents and students. > > Well, I 9m not one bit afraid of losing power. Because I trust parents and teachers, and I believe in students. > > Equal access to a quality education should be a right for every American and every parent should have the right to choose how their child is educated. Government exists to protect those rights, not usurp them. > > So let 9s face it: The opponents of parents could repeal every voucher law, close every charter school, and defund every choice program across the country. > > But school choice still wouldn 9t go away. There would still be school choices\\u2026 for the affluent and the powerful. > > Let 9s empower the forgotten parents to decide where their children go to school. Let 9s show some humility and trust all parents to know their kids 9 needs better than we do. > > Let 9s trust teachers, too. Let 9s encourage them to innovate, to create new options for students. Not just with public charter schools or magnet schools or private schools, but within the traditional csystem and with new approaches yet to be explored. > > What we 9ve been doing isn 9t serving all kids well. Let 9s unleash teachers to help solve the problem. > > You know, I 9ve never heard it claimed that giving parents more options is bad for mom and dad. Or for the child. What you hear is that it 9s bad for cthe system 3 for the school building, the school system, the funding stream. > > That argument speaks volumes about where Chicken Little 9s priorities lie. > > Our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. They deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced, and challenging life-long learning journey. Schools should be open to all students 3 no matter where they 9re growing up or how much their parents make. > > That means no more discrimination based upon zip code or socio-economic status. All means all. > > It 9s about educational freedom! Freedom from Washington mandates. Freedom from centralized control. Freedom from a one-size-fits-all mentality. Freedom from cthe system. > > Choice in education is not when a student picks a different classroom in this building or that building, uses this voucher or that tax-credit scholarship. Choice in education is bigger than that. Those are just mechanisms. > > It 9s about freedom to learn. Freedom to learn differently. Freedom to explore. Freedom to fail, to learn from falling and to get back up and try again. It 9s freedom to find the best way to learn and grow . . . to find the exciting and engaging combination that unlocks individual potential. > > Which leads to my final point: if America 9s students are to be prepared, we must rethink school. > > What I propose is not another top-down, federal government policy that promises to be a silver bullet. No. We need a paradigm shift, a fundamental reorientation . . . a rethink. > > cRethink means we question everything to ensure nothing limits a student from pursuing his or her passion, and achieving his or her potential. So each student is prepared at every turn for what comes next. > > It 9s past time to ask some of the questions that often get labeled as cnon-negotiable or just don 9t get asked at all: > > Why do we group students by age? > > Why do schools close for the summer? > > Why must the school day start with the rise of the sun? > > Why are schools assigned by your address? > > Why do students have to go to a school building in the first place? > > Why is choice only available to those who can buy their way out? Or buy their way in? > > Why can 9t a student learn at his or her own pace? > > Why isn 9t technology more widely embraced in schools? > > Why do we limit what a student can learn based upon the faculty and facilities available? > > Why? > > We must answer these questions. We must acknowledge what is and what is not working for students. > > Now, I don 9t have all the answers or policy prescriptions. No one person does. But people do know how to help their neighbors. People do know how they can help a dozen students here or 100 there. Because they know the students. They know their home lives. They know their communities. They know their parents. They know each other. > > That means learning can, should, and will look different for each unique child. And we should celebrate that, not fear it! > > I 9m well aware that change 4 the unknown 4 can be scary. That talk of fundamentally rethinking our approach to education seems impossible, insurmountable. > > But not changing is scarier. Stagnation creates risks of its own. The reality is . . . we should be horrified of not changing. > > Our children don 9t fear their futures. Think of a newborn, born into hope 4 not fear. They begin life with a clean slate. With a fresh set of eyes to see things we don 9t currently see. That 9s how students begin their lifelong learning journeys . . . with unlimited potential . . . yet with limited time. > > Their dreams, their hopes, their aspirations, their futures can 9t wait, while another wave of lawmakers puts yet another coat of paint on the broken csystem. One year may not seem like much to an adult, but it 9s much too long for the child who still can 9t read cGoodnight Moon. > > We, the public, can 9t wait either. Education is good for the public. > > Everything else 4 our health, our economy, our continued security as a nation 4 depends on what we do today for the leaders of tomorrow. It follows, then, that any educator in any learning environment serves the public good. If the purpose of public education is to educate the public, then it should\\u2026 not\\u2026 matter what word comes before school. > > What matters are the students the school serves. What matters are their futures. We 9ve been entrusted with their futures not because we asked to be, but because it 9s a duty to destiny 3 theirs . . . and ours. It all depends on what we do now. > > When our grandchildren tell their children about this moment in history, let them say we were the ones who finally put students first. > > Thank you, and I look forward to this conversation. ] ",

      "article": "[ Dr. Arnold Gold, a pediatric neurologist whose belief in the importance of an empathetic bedside manner led him and his wife to create a foundation to inspire young doctors to practice compassionate patient care, died on Jan. 23 in Manhattan. He was 92. , His wife, Sandra Gold, confirmed his death. ,  cYou 9re only half a physician if you 9re just good at your craft, Dr. Gold said in an interview in 2016 for the [Arnold P. Gold Foundation](http://www.gold-foundation.org/). cUnless it 9s coupled with patient-centered care and humanism, it 9s suboptimal care. , Dr. Gold, who treated patients and taught for more than 50 years at the[ Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/education/physicians_surgeons), part of Columbia University Medical Center, had a cheerful but authoritative demeanor. On rounds, he wanted to know about the life of the patient, not just his vital signs. He talked face to face with his young patients, often sitting on the floor and playing with them. ,  cHe enjoyed kids and he dealt with them in a wondrous way, Dr. David Mandelbaum, a former student of Dr. Gold 9s at Columbia who is a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the Brown University Alpert Medical School, said in a telephone interview. cHe always sensed what a kid was able to do, not what he couldn 9t do. , He was also concerned with the patients 9 parents, spending time, for example, to understand the effects that a neurologically damaged child 9s condition had on their marriage and finances. And if he could not give them hope, he gave them answers. ,  cHe told me the worst news in the most loving way, Amy Gleicher said in a telephone interview, recalling Dr. Gold 9s diagnosis concerning her year-old son, Max, in 1993. cHe told me my son was mentally retarded in such a way that I had dignity and my child had value. , Dr. Gold continued his humane approach as advances like M.R.I. 9s and CT scans revolutionized medicine. But he became distressed in the 1970s and 980s, he said, as he watched students and other doctors become too focused on technology and not enough on the people they were treating. ,  cSo one day in 1988, he said in the 2016 interview, cI was making rounds with the students and residents and a student presented me 8the brain tumor in 209. 9 And I said: 8The brain tumor? Isn 9t there a child involved in this? Tell me about the child, tell me about the family. Tell me how this is impacting on the family. Do you know any of this? 9 They did not, he said. , At home that night, he told his wife of his concerns about where medicine was headed. As he recalled, she told him, cYou know, Arnold, I 9m tired of you griping about medicine. _Do_ something about it or shut up. , They began the Arnold P. Gold Foundation together in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in 1988, hoping to clone Dr. Gold 9s humane approach to patient engagement. [They started white-coat ceremonies at medical schools](http://www .gold-foundation.org/what-do-medical-students-hope-to-remember-about-their- white-coat-ceremony/) in which students pledge the Hippocratic oath in the early days of their education, rather than at graduation, as is common practice. Dr. Gold felt that graduation was too late to set expectations for the clinicians they would become. ,  cThis should be established at Day 1, he said in the interview. , Arnold Perlman Gold was born in Manhattan on Aug. 8, 1925. His father, Michael, a Jewish native of Dublin, and his mother, the former Rebecca Perlman, were lawyers. As a youngster, Arnold read cArrowsmith, Sinclair Lewis 9s 1925 novel about a doctor 9s search for truth. ,  cArnold was very idealistic and wanted to save the world, said Dr. Brian Benson, Dr. Gold 9s son-in-law, cand he was very impacted by that book. , In 1938, when Arnold was 13, his father died, and his mother sent him to live with an aunt in Galveston, Tex., believing that he might get a better chance at an education there. He attended the University of Texas, Austin, but left to serve stateside in World War II as a Navy corpsman. , He later graduated from the University of Texas, studied for a master 9s at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and earned his medical degree from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. , During his internship at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Dr. Gold tended to 30 children with polio who were in iron lungs. His mentor there, Dr. Margaret Smith, ctaught me a lot about patient-centered care, and she also led me into the field of pediatrics, he said in 2016. ,  cI was originally going to be an internist, an endocrinologist, he said. , When he was chief resident at Cincinnati Children 9s Hospital, part of his work placed him in Dr. Albert Sabin 9s laboratory while [Dr. Sabin](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0826.html \"His obituary.\") was developing the oral polio vaccine. While in Cincinnati, Dr. Gold rode horseback for the Frontier Nursing Service to treat people in rural Kentucky. , He returned to New York as visiting chief resident at the [Babies Hospital](http://www.nyp.org/morganstanley/about-us/history) at the NewYork Presbyterian-Columbia University campus (now Morgan Stanley Children 9s Hospital) before beginning his long career at Columbia in child neurology. , Dr. Gold lived with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which affected his muscles later in his life and made it difficult for him to breathe. He treated patients until he was 88 and [spoke at last year 9s white-coat ceremony at the](http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2017/08/14/ps-community-welcomes- class-2021-white-coat-ceremony/) College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia. , Besides his wife, the former Sandra Orenberg, who has a doctorate in counseling, he is survived by two daughters, Amelia Gold and Maggie Gold Seelig; a stepdaughter, Jennifer Arnold; a stepson, Stephen Silver; and 13 grandchildren. His stepson [Jeffrey Silver died](http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/community-mourns-passing-of- pure-soul/) in 2010. , Dr. Gold recalled that in creating his foundation, his goal was to change the course of medical education. ,  cMy colleagues were very distressed, he recalled in the 2016 interview. cThey looked at me as sort of, 8What 9s happening to Arnold? 9 And one of them even said to me, 8I think you 9re smoking opium, 9 and, 8How could you ever believe that you can change medicine? 9 People were not very encouraging. , But 30 years later, the foundation said, more than 170 medical schools and physician assistant programs hold white-coat ceremonies annually. More than 260 nursing schools hold similar gatherings. , The foundation has also inducted 30,000 students, residents and faculty into its Gold Humanism Honor Society to recognize their compassionate patient care. The designation became prestigious enough for medical students to include it in applications for residencies. , Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, the president and chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said in an email that the honor society cdemonstrates that, increasingly, the medical profession recognizes humanistic attributes such as empathy and compassion as being every bit as important as academic achievement. , He added, cThis is just one more element of Dr. Gold 9s outstanding legacy. ] ",

Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said that \"choosing to ignore the rights of transgender students and to not enforce Title IX when it comes to their protection is an unambiguous step backwards for civil rights in this country.\" The development, which [was first reported by BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/edu-dept-trans-student- bathrooms?utm_term=.afY251de6.ctYNZRj6r), was widely criticized by civil rights groups, who said it could endanger the welfare of transgender students. \"While civil rights advocates have suspected that the Department of Education was not acting on complaints brought forward by transgender students, reports that these violations are completely being ignored are reprehensible,\" said HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow. \"The department's failure to act conflicts with the law in multiple jurisdictions, including federal circuits, and further emboldens those who seek to discriminate against transgender students. Once again, Secretary [Betsy] DeVos proves she is not interested in protecting transgender students and instead is choosing to advance the dangerous Trump- Pence anti-LGBTQ agenda.\" Eliza Byard, the executive director of GLSEN, called the Department of Education's decision not to investigate the complaints \"cruel\" and said the department's policies were \"hurting transgender students in concrete and far- reaching ways.\" \"Congress created the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education in order to ensure that marginalized and vulnerable students had a champion. Under Secretary DeVos, the office has abdicated that solemn responsibility for transgender youth,\" Byard said. \"OCR's cruel new policy flies in the face of the highest court rulings on this issue, which found unequivocally that denying transgender students appropriate bathroom access is a violation of Title IX.\" ] ",

But economists, surely, inhabit planet Earth, surveying it dispassionately. Alas, a new paper suggests that even dismal scientists divide on gender lines. Ann Mari May and Mary McGarvey of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and David Kucera of the International Labour Organisation surveyed economists from 18 European countries, and found that differences in the wider population can survive even an economics education. Male economists are more likely than female ones to prefer market solutions to government intervention, are more sceptical of environmental protection, and are (slightly) less keen on redistribution (see chart).  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Women were 14 percentage points less likely to agree that Walmart generates net benefits, and 30 points more likely to agree that American openness to trade should be tied to higher labour standards abroad. Perhaps the divergence does not matter. Good economics should, after all, involve using theory and data to quell prejudices. But some evidence suggests that ideology seeps into economists 9 work. Zubin Jelveh of the University of Chicago, Suresh Naidu of Columbia University and Bruce Kogut of Columbia Business School parse the language used in economics papers to identify the authors 9 predilections, and confirm that they match their participation in political petitions. They find that right-wing economists tend to produce estimates that fit their anti-interventionist views. Other data crunched by Mr Naidu confirm that women use more left-leaning language than men. The differences in opinion are cause for concern when the overwhelming preponderance of men in the economics profession is taken into account. Ms May and her co-authors found that men in their sample were twice as likely to be full professors as women. If economists 9 senior ranks are skewed in favour of men, then the profession 9s output might also be biased towards results they find appealing. A final difference that Ms May and her co-authors uncover suggests one reason why economists might dismiss gender differences as a problem. Male economists are relatively likely to think that men and women face equal job opportunities generally, and that pay gaps are largely explained by differences in skills and choice. By contrast, women are more likely to perceive unequal opportunities, both in general and specifically within academia. If women hold different views to men, then that could put them at odds with the profession 9s more senior gatekeepers. And if men are more likely to have faith in markets to nudge women to the best jobs, then they could be more resistant to the idea that the gender imbalance is a problem that needs solving. Men were also more sceptical than women that greater gender balance in research teams would improve economic knowledge. Of course, some differences of opinion need not necessarily reflect well on women. It might be that they suffer from cmotivated reasoning d, believing that their lack of promotion is because of the system rather than their own shortcomings, or that economics would benefit from more people like them. Alternatively, their personal experiences could give them information that men do not have. It seems plausible that men are susceptible to motivated reasoning too. It is easier to attribute one 9s success to hard work than to unfair privilege. Even the most brilliant of economists can be blind to their own biases. In 1960 George Stigler, a late Nobel laureate and dogged empiricist, bemoaned the cdeleterious effects of economists 9 policy desires on their theory, but maintained that overall, as a positive science, economics was ethically and politically neutral. Yet some of his own views fell short of this ideal. Susan Brandwayn, one of his former students and now an independent economist, remembers Mr Stigler telling her class that the day the University of Chicago 9s economics faculty hired a woman was the day that he would leave.  _ **Correction (February 25th 2018):** An earlier version of this piece referred to Susan Brandwayn as one of George Stigler 9s graduate students and suggested he had made his comment about the hiring of women to her. In fact he was speaking to her class in graduate school._ This article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Battle of the X 9s\" ] ",

England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed \\xa370m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities.    It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North.   * [Is there a north-south divide in schools?](/news/education-38172816)   * [Osborne urges action on north-south divide](/news/business-42893861)  The commissioner's research also finds:   * too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up   * more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good   * large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18   * there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities  Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. * * *  Teenagers' concerns Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. \"There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,\" said Hafsah. \"Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p062dkf7.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionHow Northern students see North-South education gap \"It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. \"It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. \"For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out. But it's not fair.\" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. \"A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. \"So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you.\" Qasim added: \"If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education.

She added: \"Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. \"There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. \"Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives.\"  Image copyrightOffice of the Children's CommissionerImage caption The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England  Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. \"The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do.\" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. \"We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. \"So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. \"Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. \"The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools.\"  'More to do' The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as \"Opportunity Areas\" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: \"We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. \"As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. \"Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes \\xa33.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, \\xa312m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home.\" The government has also committed \\xa370m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. \"By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England\"  ] ",

Professor Edgar, who wrote South Carolina: A History, said the state had even turned down free blacks who wanted to volunteer to fight during the US Civil War because they didn't want to arm African Americans. No black people served as soldiers and the only African Americans in the Confederate army from South Carolina were either slaves or free blacks forced to work as servants or in the kitchen, according to the academic. There is debate among historians over this issue. John Stauffer, a professor of African-American studies at Harvard University, says there were Confederate black soldiers. [He has previously estimated](https://www.theroot.com/yes-there-were-black- confederates-here-s-why-1790858546) that between 3,000 and 6,000 African Americans served in the rebel ranks, possibly because they were promised freedom by plantation owners. Professor Stauffer has calculated that another 100,000 or so black people supported the Confederacy as labourers and servants, building fortifications and batteries. The recent movement to erase Confederate iconography - including flags and monuments - accelerated after the 2015 shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.

(Maria Danilova/AP) The Trump administration 9s 2019 budget proposal for the U.S. Education Department was just released, and it shows the continuing support that President Trump and Secretary Betsy DeVos have for expanding school choice, or alternatives to traditional public education. For the second year in a row, the administration has proposed slashing the department 9s budget while spending more than $1 billion on vouchers 4 which use public money for private and religious schools 4 and other choice programs. Congress may not approve the request, but it shows Trump 9s and DeVos 9s priorities. _[[ DeVos seeks cuts from Education Department to support school choice ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/devos-seeks- massive-cuts-from-education-department-to-support-school- choice/?utm_term=.2d61b70c2e0d)]_ Charter schools and vouchers are well-known choice alternatives, but there are others that are less familiar, including what 9s called cEducation Savings Accounts, or ESAs. They may become more popular in states as the billionaire Koch brothers and their network plan to spend millions of dollars to push them and other efforts to privatize public education. ESAs are personal accounts created by a state for parents to use for a range of educational costs 4 including private school tuition and fees, as well as private tutoring 4 with state education funds. The trend in ESAs is that there is no means test, part of a larger shift in some parts of the school choice movement from advocating for choice being for low-income students to escape failing traditional public schools to choice being for all families. This is the vision that conservatives, such as the Kochs and DeVos and her longtime ally, former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), want to see become reality throughout the United States. Critics say that a publicly funded school system that is open to all students cannot function without stable budgets that would be disrupted by such a choice program. Here is a primer on ESAs written by Carol Burris, a former award-winning New York high school principal who is executive director of the [Network for Public Education](https://networkforpubliceducation.org/), a nonprofit advocacy group. Burris was named the 2010 Educator of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State, and\\xa0in 2013, the National Association of Secondary School Principals named her the New York State High School Principal of the Year. Burris has been chronicling problems with modern school reform and school choice for years on this blog. She has previously written about problems with charter schools in California and a number of other states. _[[ What 8school choice 9 means in the era of Trump and DeVos ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/22/what-school- choice-means-in-the-era-of-trump-and-devos/?utm_term=.58cd4fa382c7)]_ _**By Carol Burris**_ > _ cMy personal opinion is that the 12,000 or 13,000 government-run, unionized, politicized monopolies 4 we call them school districts 4 is not the best governance model for the world we 9re moving towards. 4 Jeb Bush_ The above definition of a public school district was given by former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) [at a recent panel on Education Savings Accounts](http://www.aei.org/events/education-savings-accounts-jeb-bush-on- the-future-of-educational-choice-2/) at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. At the event, Bush, who was a pioneer in the education reform movement that relied on high-stakes standardized tests for evaluation purposes and on the Common Core State Standards, argued that states should give parents tax dollars on a debit card to buy customized education services as an alternative to public schools. The marketplace would be in charge. Parents, he said, would be cthe regulators. Welcome to the world of Education Savings Accounts, often referred to as ESAs. If you are not familiar with Education Savings Accounts, you should be. During a recent[ three-day seminar in Indian Wells, Calif.,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/?utm_term=.ad7c0c96ef50) hosted by the billionaire Koch brothers, ESAs were announced as one of their identified legislative priorities of 2018. And they have already gotten started. The Koch 9s 501(c)4, Americans for Prosperity, is pouring millions into an effort to defeat a November ballot referendum to overturn the expansion of ESAs in Arizona. _[[ The Daily 202: Koch network laying groundwork to fundamentally transform America 9s education system ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/)]_ Last year, the Arizona legislature narrowly passed a bill making ESAs eventually available to all K-12 students in the state\\xa0 4 [despite reports](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona- education/2017/01/31/arizona-school-vouchers-expansion-audit/97163702/)\\xa0of lax oversight and fraudulent spending in the state 9s small existing program. Following the passage of the bill, a scrappy group of parents and teachers came together to form [Save Our Schools Arizona](https://sosarizona.org/), gathering enough signatures to put ESAs up for a public vote. The Kochs have fought to shut down the referendum in the courts and on the airwaves ever since. Of all the various school privatization programs, Educational Savings Accounts are the most market-based and the least accountable. What they ultimately do is reduce society 9s obligation to educate our nation 9s youth to the dropping of tax dollars onto a debit card. There are six states with ESA programs: Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Nevada. Nevada 9s program is nonoperational and unfunded. In a seventh state, New Hampshire, ESAs are likely to be approved this year. Last year, more than 20 state legislatures introduced ESA bills, with the proposed programs nearly always going by a different name. For example, ESAs are called Gardiner Scholarships in Florida, Individualized Education Accounts in Tennessee and Empowerment Scholarship Accounts in Arizona. Despite the different names, intended to hide the joint effort by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful conservative organization, to promote the same basic bill, they operate in similar ways. _[[ This ALEC state report card speaks volumes about Betsy DeVos 9s education agenda ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/08/13/this-alec-state-report-card-speaks-volumes-about-betsy- devoss-education-agenda/?utm_term=.c059f6c08804)]_ Parents pledge not to enroll their son or daughter in a public school or a charter school. In exchange, they get nearly all of what the school would have spent (usually 90 percent) placed on a debit card or in an account. The remaining 10 percent is used to fund program administration. Parents can use the money for private or religious school tuition, online learning, books, hippotherapy (horseback riding for therapeutic purposes) and home schooling 4 or they can choose to spend minimal dollars on K-12 education and save for college. There is no obligation that the curriculum that is used to teach students who use ESAs to attend private schools be developmentally appropriate, challenging or even accurate. Although a few states require parents to promise that their children receive instruction in reading, grammar, mathematics, science and social studies, what content is taught and what is learned is immaterial. If at this point you are thinking that most taxpayers would view such an unaccountable and unregulated system as one in which families could easily be victimized by misinformation, false claims, profiteering and fraud, you would be right. This is not lost on the proponents of ESAs. That is why they have developed all kinds of language to make ESAs seem hip and cutting-edge, when they are really advocating a return to a time before the 1830s when schooling was a haphazard event for all but the wealthy. **The Language of the cCustomizers d** The AEI panel that Bush introduced provided insight into how proponents cmarket ESAs. Lindsey Burke of the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/) referred to many ESA parents as ccustomizers who buy ca la carte education with their debit card. According to Burke, 20 percent of all Florida ESA students never set foot in a bricks-and-mortar school, which she enthusiastically embraced as success. Adam Peshek of Bush 9s [Foundation for Excellence in Education](https://www.excelined.org/) proposed that individual teachers go into business for themselves by recruiting students for their cmicro schools. He suggested that they could charge students $100 a session to attend. ESAs, he said, will lead to the cnext generation of accountability modeled after Yelp and Urbanspoon. Peshek views ESAs as a gamble in innovation, saying that ESAs allow cyou to make small bets in education where if it works, great. And cif it doesn 9t work, no problem, because you 9re making small bets and you 9re adjusting in real time. But there is a problem he didn 9t mention. Those csmall bets are made at kids 9 expense. Panelist Jonathan Beckam of [Step Up for Students](https://www.stepupforstudents.org/) described how his organization, with the help of ctwo big companies, created cthe largest online marketplace for ESAs. Here is how he described his work: > cSo from a family 9s perspective, it 9s really like an Amazon shopping experience. I can log on to this private marketplace. I can see thousands of products and services that are preapproved for acceptable use for my program. I can click into those products and get detailed product information and availability for it. I can add it to my shopping cart and check out using my ESA funds directly. When the panel was over, it was time for questions. An earnest young man from the University of Georgia asked the following: > cThe University of Georgia is in one of the poorest counties in the state of Georgia: Adams Clark County. A bunch of parents are working two, three jobs to help their children get by and to, you know, possibly save up so their children can get a better life than they did. My question for you is: With all of these programs, with this $21,000 you were talking about, how do you work with giving the parents the time to get as involved as we would want them to be? How would we 4 how do you work with giving the parents the time as well as that money? The host responded: cI will hold off that. Thank you for that one, and we 9ll take a question here. All of the talk of customization, a la carte services and the glorification of choice, is designed to entice parents to support what many people see as an unsustainable and irresponsible system were it to become widescale. ESAs are a mechanism to change the way we fund education by assigning each child a backpack full of cash. How much is in the backpack would be determined by the state. Over time, if parents want more than some basic educational services, they would need to kick in money themselves. It is the Chilean model. As money is drained from school districts, services go down, resulting in more students exiting with their funding, leaving still less for those who remain. Beth Lewis, one of the co-founders of SOS Arizona, knows exactly what happens over time when school choice becomes the means to undermine public education.  cIn the past two decades in Arizona, we 9ve seen millions of public dollars diverted to private schools through ESA vouchers and other programs, she said. cIn this same time period, our state leaders have strategically divested in our public schools, driving us down to 49th in the nation in teacher pay and per-student spending. Arizona is a cautionary tale of what can (and will) go wrong with the privatization of our public schools. And there is no reason to believe that the Koch brothers and other right-wing libertarians such as the DeVos family will stop with public schools. As Texan Stacy Hock[ told The Washington Post ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/?utm_term=.e81227228508)at the Kochs 9 Indian Wells soiree, K-12 education is on the agenda because it is the clowest-hanging fruit for policy change in the United States. Easy pickings may not be final pickings for those who want to commercialize every aspect of America 9s public services. ] ",

      "article": "[  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deployed a new weapon at the Olympics to fight back against the Trump administration 9s sanctions and threats of a preemptive strike against his nuclear program: His sister. Kim Yo Jong shook hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, cheered enthusiastically for a unified Korean team, and displayed a sense of humor in weekend meetings. She also delivered a letter [inviting](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-10/kim-jong-un- invites-south-korea-s-moon-to-summit-in-pyongyang \"Kim Summit Invitation to South Korea May Ease Peninsula Tensions\") Moon to a summit with her brother in Pyongyang, and asked him to play a cleading role in reuniting the two Koreas after nearly seven decades.  cI never expected to come here on such short notice to be honest, and I thought it would be strange and different but it 9s not, Kim Yo Jong said at a dinner Sunday night before heading home. cThere are many things similar and the same. I hope we can quickly become one and meet these good people again in Pyongyang.     The warm words were aimed at further exploiting divisions between the U.S. and South Korea, which differ on the best way to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. Her visit amounted to a charm offensive designed to counter the U.S. narrative that Kim Jong Un is a madman who tortures his own people and would blow up Los Angeles or New York City if he didn 9t get his way. North Korea 9s participation in the Olympics has already allowed Kim Jong Un to undermine President Donald Trump 9s pressure campaign, with some sanctions suspended temporarily until the event ends. In pushing for a summit with Moon, Kim is seeking to consolidate those gains while maintaining his nuclear arsenal to deter a U.S. invasion. The question now is whether the U.S. and South Korea can stay united in keeping up the pressure on North Korea just as sanctions limiting export revenue and curbing fuel imports start to bite. While Trump 9s advisers have threatened military action to prevent Kim from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon, Moon is seeking to prevent a war that could devastate South Korea and the region. Kim 9s proposal for a summit was ca brilliant diplomatic maneuver, said Andrei Lankov, a historian at Kookmin University in Seoul who once studied in Pyongyang. Moon would irritate Trump if he accepts the invitation, while declining would make the U.S. and South Korea appear cunreasonably bellicose, he said. [How North Korea Managed to Crash the Olympics Party](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/the-koreas-get-in- the-olympic-spirit-for-now \"Click for full story\")      cThe proposal, as well as North Korea 9s presence at the Games, sends a signal that the North Koreans are ready to talk, Lankov said. cAnd this signal helps the opponents of a military operation in Washington and elsewhere. Signs of discord in the U.S.-South Korea alliance were evident immediately after the announcement. Moon 9s office initially provided conflicting accounts of whether he accepted the invitation, with a Blue House spokesperson later clarifying that pre-conditions first needed to be met. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence didn 9t discuss the invitation with Moon Saturday while they watched a speed-skating event, a senior White House official said. Speaking to reporters later, Pence reiterated that there was cno daylight between the U.S., South Korea and Japan in pushing to isolate North Korea until Kim abandons his nuclear program.  Pence Talks Later on, Pence told the Washington Post that the U.S. is ready to engage in talks about North Korea 9s nuclear program even as it maintains pressure on Kim 9s regime. In the interview, he said Moon assured him that the North Koreans wouldn 9t get economic or diplomatic benefits for just talking 4 only for taking concrete steps toward denuclearization. Moon came to power promising a softer approach to Pyongyang and has repeatedly sought a summit with Kim Jong Un. Moon initially opposed U.S. plans to deploy a missile shield in South Korea, and last year vowed to prevent war at all costs after Trump threatened cfire and fury against North Korea. Moon faces the risk of a backlash at home if he goes too far. His approval ratings, while still high at 63 percent, fell after he pushed for a unified women 9s ice hockey team for the two Koreas. Conservative groups have protested the appearance of North Korean athletes at the Games in Pyeongchang with vulgar signs.  8Wild Dream 9 South Korea 9s Unification Ministry said Monday that the dialogue would be led by the two Koreas with cooperation and support from international partners. South Korea cwill faithfully implement the international sanctions on North Korea, while also adhering to the principle of resolution through peaceful means, it said. North Korea has shown no signs it 9s willing to discuss denuclearization. Its negotiators protested last month when South Koreans raised the issue during talks over the Olympics, a line North Korea 9s state-run media has reiterated. Last week, a commentary published by the Korean Central News Agency called denuclearization ca wild dream that can never come true. Moon won 9t have much space to negotiate with North Korea without backing from the U.S.,\\xa0said Christopher Green, senior adviser on the Korean peninsula at the International Crisis Group in Amsterdam.  cHis goal is to do enough on the inter-Korean front to get the United States and North Korea to jaw-jaw, Green said. cThe real strategic games have only just begun.  _ 4 With assistance by Sohee Kim, and Toluse Olorunnipa_  ] ",

It was intended to acknowledge the powerful force of momentum. The Supreme Court hears but a lean fraction of cases seeking its review. Among the [factors ](https://www.supremecourt.gov/filingandrules/2017RulesoftheCourt.pdf)it considers is the divisiveness of the issue presented, the impact of the court's holding on the nation, and whether the conduct at issue offends our collective constitutional principles. But as landmark civil rights cases like Brown v. Board of Education or Lawrence v. Texas demonstrate, momentum has a way of catapulting an issue to the front of the figurative queue. But sometimes momentum yields unfortunate results. Before invalidating a key provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get pre-authorization from the Department of Justice before making any changes to its voting laws, for instance, Chief Justice John Roberts[ implied](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/holder-v-roberts) the election of black men and women to political office placed us in a post-racial world that no longer required this kind of government oversight. Ginsburg correctly dissented, arguing instead that such protections were necessary in spite of perceptions of progress. She, like others who have experienced discrimination, understood that pruning the tree of oppression doesn't destroy its roots. Milestones, no matter how significant, should neither be blindly touted nor used as an excuse to call off the watchdogs. It should shock and offend you that a nation this old should still be patted on the back for taking its first steps.

People believed that we were in a post-gender world. We're not. People are surprised to learn that democratic principles of equality remain aspirational, and elude huge segments of our population. Even 45 years after the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade, the right of women to exercise autonomy over their bodies remains vulnerable to political attack.

Almost half of students from the fifth grade cannot read texts meant for second-graders. Private tutors are called upon. Buses are plastered with ads for cramming institutes claiming to have coached exam ctoppers d, a status that rivals cricket superstardom. (A rival to Byju 9s is inevitably called Toppr.) According to one estimate, a quarter of all Indian students attend private coaching classes. Byju Raveendran should know. A few years ago, he used to attract 25,000 students to a particular stadium in Delhi, and fly to nine cities every week to teach high-school maths. Youngsters would learn shortcuts and tips to ace the fiendishly hard Common Admission Test for the best schools. Given the enormous size of the classrooms, it was impossible to make the sessions interactive, so Mr Raveendran came up with the idea of converting the lessons into video gobbets and hosting them online. The business has 900,000 paid users who spend over 50 minutes on the app each day 4metrics that media firms might envy. Around nine-tenths of customers of Byju 9s renew subscriptions despite an annual price tag of $350-450, not far from half the median annual income of an Indian. Sales for the twelve months to March 2017 reached $40.6m, and the firm says it expects to turn a profit in the current financial year. Prominent investors including Silicon Valley 9s Sequoia Capital and China 9s Tencent have put in a total of $200m, and Byju 9s has a punchy valuation of $800m. That is despite a patchy record for Indian edtech firms. Indian schools are price-sensitive and tend not to be early tech adopters, says Kartik Aneja of Nayi Disha, which makes educational digital games. Educomp, a maker of technology-enabled classroom products, used to sell expensive digital content and multimedia equipment to schools and was valued at over $1.4bn in 2008, but filed for bankruptcy last year. Byju 9s managed to bypass schools by selling directly to students and parents. Other challenges remain. The company has to send out physical memory cards to students who might not have sufficient internet bandwidth to download materials (a previous satellite-based method proved unreliable in bad weather). And a network of hundreds of agents is needed to collect cash from parents unused to paying digitally, adding to costs. Smartphones will spread, broadband will improve and online payments should become simpler. Less certain is whether parents will allow their kids to learn chiefly from screens. Little verifiable evidence exists that methods devised by Byju 9s succeed as well as customers hope. It would be an unusual child, though, that could be left unmoved by one bit of maths content advertised by the firm 4Shah Rukh Khan, a Bollywood star, guiding a troupe of dancers rhythmically laying out a proof for Pythagoras 9s theorem.

If successful, this [regressive law ](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hr-620-could-put-disability-rights-at- risk)would significantly hinder a person with a disability's right to file a lawsuit for violations of access. It would require creating a written claim with specific legal requirements to document the violation (which would be onerous for an attorney, let alone your average John Q. Public with little experience with accessibility requirements and measurements). Businesses would then have 60 days to respond and an additional 120 days make \"[substantial progress](https://www.defendingourfuture.org/hr-620-ada-education-and-reform- act/)\" -- a term still undefined. In practice, business owners could spend decades failing to comply with the accessibility requirements of the ADA as long as they claim to be attempting substantial progress. This attempt to undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities is happening largely in response to several stories claiming that there is a growing army of disabled people cruising the streets, looking for potential lawsuits wherever they go, and are getting rich off of the spoils. The reality, of course, is that the only thing that can be collected in ADA lawsuits are attorney's fees, so no disabled person who brings charges can actually get monetary damages from a lawsuit. All they can achieve is the business remedying its inaccessibility. ![A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family ](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) ![A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family ](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley-family-1-large-169.jpg) ![A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family ](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley- family-1-large-169.jpg)[](javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family Replay [More Videos ...](/videos)  MUST WATCH A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family 04:42 Furthermore, in cases where it's assumed that there are hundreds of lawyers repeatedly filing case after case to the point of appearing fraudulent, the Center for American Progress (where I am a senior fellow) has traced the number of attorneys doing so to only 12 lawyers, and there are disciplinary actions available to take action against them in state bar associations or district courts. A federal law -- especially one that would harm more than help -- is hardly necessary here. There is a significant countermovement against this legislation, comprised of a mix of social media (with groups like Crip the Vote and others using HandsOffMyADA), traditional civil disobedience by [ADAPT](http://adapt.org/) and others, visits to legislators and phone banking by older disability organizations like the ARC and the Autism Society. These organizations are also working with groups like[ Little Lobbyists ](https://www.littlelobbyists.org/)and other parent/family organizations who organized last year to protect Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. For those of us who are parents and working in the disability justice space, these alliances are proving to be interesting examples of not having to choose one group or the other. As someone who was 10 years old when the ADA became law, I have little memory of life before it, beyond what I've heard from my parents and elders in the community. The notion that I will need to start thinking about life without the ADA or with extremely limited access, paired with additional bureaucratic measures required to access public spaces, feels like I forgot to turn off Netflix before bed and an especially dark episode of \"Black Mirror\" is still playing in the background.

Almost half of students from the fifth grade cannot read texts meant for second-graders. Private tutors are called upon. Buses are plastered with ads for cramming institutes claiming to have coached exam ctoppers d, a status that rivals cricket superstardom. (A rival to Byju 9s is inevitably called Toppr.) According to one estimate, a quarter of all Indian students attend private coaching classes. Byju Raveendran should know. A few years ago, he used to attract 25,000 students to a particular stadium in Delhi, and fly to nine cities every week to teach high-school maths. Youngsters would learn shortcuts and tips to ace the fiendishly hard Common Admission Test for the best schools. Given the enormous size of the classrooms, it was impossible to make the sessions interactive, so Mr Raveendran came up with the idea of converting the lessons into video gobbets and hosting them online. The business has 900,000 paid users who spend over 50 minutes on the app each day 4metrics that media firms might envy. Around nine-tenths of customers of Byju 9s renew subscriptions despite an annual price tag of $350-450, not far from half the median annual income of an Indian. Sales for the twelve months to March 2017 reached $40.6m, and the firm says it expects to turn a profit in the current financial year. Prominent investors including Silicon Valley 9s Sequoia Capital and China 9s Tencent have put in a total of $200m, and Byju 9s has a punchy valuation of $800m. That is despite a patchy record for Indian edtech firms. Indian schools are price-sensitive and tend not to be early tech adopters, says Kartik Aneja of Nayi Disha, which makes educational digital games. Educomp, a maker of technology-enabled classroom products, used to sell expensive digital content and multimedia equipment to schools and was valued at over $1.4bn in 2008, but filed for bankruptcy last year. Byju 9s managed to bypass schools by selling directly to students and parents. Other challenges remain. The company has to send out physical memory cards to students who might not have sufficient internet bandwidth to download materials (a previous satellite-based method proved unreliable in bad weather). And a network of hundreds of agents is needed to collect cash from parents unused to paying digitally, adding to costs. Smartphones will spread, broadband will improve and online payments should become simpler. Less certain is whether parents will allow their kids to learn chiefly from screens. Little verifiable evidence exists that methods devised by Byju 9s succeed as well as customers hope. It would be an unusual child, though, that could be left unmoved by one bit of maths content advertised by the firm 4Shah Rukh Khan, a Bollywood star, guiding a troupe of dancers rhythmically laying out a proof for Pythagoras 9s theorem.

'Brainwashing' process Kanat and other human rights advocates describe, citing sources on the ground, how people supposedly prone to influences of Islamic extremism undergo a \"brainwashing\" process inside the detention camps -- often housed in converted schools or government buildings. Detainees are required to praise the ruling Communist Party, sing revolutionary songs, learn to speak Mandarin, study the thought of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and confess perceived transgressions such as praying at a mosque or traveling abroad, according to activists. \"It's completely unlawful -- the authorities provide no legal documentation to the families and there are no time limits (on the length of detention),\" said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, which published a detailed report on the subject last September and called on Beijing to free all detainees. ![Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) ![Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180201130146-xinjiang-anti-terror- propaganda-posters-large-169.jpg) Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014. \"There's a lot of fear, with people losing contact with loved ones.\" Xinjiang authorities have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for information on the political education camps and response to activists' allegations, but state media outlets have covered these facilities and touted their effectiveness in de-radicalizing the locals. One newspaper article last April said that Uyghur residents \"eat and live alongside party cadres\" in one such camp that had [\"already trained 2,008 people.\"](http://www.xinjiangyaou.com/xinjiang/002/1455513.shtml) Calling for a \"great wall of iron\" to safeguard the region's stability, President Xi has further expanded and strengthened China's vast security forces in Xinjiang.  Ubiquitous surveillance Activists say the regional government, now led by a hardline Xi loyalist, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs but also increasingly relied on high-tech tools to keep the population in check. They cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65. The authorities also enacted a sweeping anti-extremism law last year, [with long beards, veils in public and home-schooling all on the ban list,](https://cnn.com/2017/03/31/asia/china-xinjiang-new-rules/index.html) prompting new denunciations from international human rights groups. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment as well as curtailed religious freedom in their homeland. Other critics have linked the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's repressive reign there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. ![A Chinese paramilitary policeman watches as an ethnic Uyghur family walks in front of Urumqi&39;s Grand Bazaar, July, 2009. ](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) ![A Chinese paramilitary policeman watches as an ethnic Uyghur family walks in front of Urumqi&39;s Grand Bazaar, July, 2009. ](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180201130446-xinjiang-urumqis-grand-bazaar- large-169.jpg) A Chinese paramilitary policeman watches as an ethnic Uyghur family walks in front of Urumqi's Grand Bazaar, July, 2009. Over the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, has also fueled ethnic tensions, despite the government's best effort to paint a picture of ethnic harmony. \"We guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnicities and prohibit the discrimination and oppression against any ethnic groups,\" Zhang Yijiong, a senior Communist Party official in charge ethnic minority affairs, told reporters last October. \"The cultures, histories, languages and traditions of all ethnicities are protected and respected by national laws.\" Critics of Beijing's Uyghur policy see a starkly different scenario in Xinjiang, as the authorities intensify their crackdown and forced political indoctrination spreads. \"These campaigns are purportedly about counter-extremism and counterterrorism, but ... it's really about surveillance, control and assimilation,\" said Wang, the Human Rights Watch researcher. \"The real intention of the Chinese government is to eliminate the Uyghurs as a distinct ethnic group,\" Rebiya Kadeer, a longtime exiled Uyghur leader who recently stepped down as president of the World Uyghur Congress, told CNN in an interview in Washington last year. \"Religious suppression, cultural restrictions, Uyghur language ban -- all this repression in Xinjiang only makes the Uyghurs hold on to their identity more firmly,\" she added. \"China has awakened the Uyghur people.\" ] ",

Some commercial software can now tell the gender of a person in a photograph. , When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time. , But the darker the skin, the more errors arise 4 up to nearly 35 percent for images of darker skinned women, according to a new study that breaks fresh ground by measuring how the technology works on people of different races and gender. , These disparate results, calculated by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, show how some of the biases in the real world can seep into artificial intelligence, the computer systems that inform facial recognition. , In modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women. , One widely used facial-recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white, according to another research study. , The new study also raises broader questions of fairness and accountability in artificial intelligence at a time when investment in and adoption of the technology is racing ahead. , Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending. , Researchers at the Georgetown Law School [estimated that 117 million American adults](https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement 4 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases. , Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far. ,  cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail 4 to make them socially accountable, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah. , Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, [Google had to apologize](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/google- photos-mistakenly-labels-black-people-gorillas/) after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as cgorillas. , Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini 9s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations. ,  cBut this is the first work I 9m aware of that shows that empirically, Ms. Friedler said. , Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long. , But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face. , By then, face recognition software was increasingly moving out of the lab and into the mainstream. ,  cO.K., this is serious, she recalled deciding then. cTime to do something. , So she turned her attention to fighting the bias built into digital technology. Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of calgorithmic accountability, which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair. , Her [short TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms) on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajlunited.org/), a project to raise awareness of the issue. , In her newly [published paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf), which will be presented at [a conference](https://fatconference.org/) this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems 4 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China 4 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software 4 and their code was publicly available for testing. , She found them all wanting. , To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark- skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents. , The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race. , Then, each company 9s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft 9s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM 9s and Megvii 9s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males. , Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was cdeeply committed to cunbiased and ctransparent services. This month, the company said, it will roll out an improved service with a nearly 10-fold increase in accuracy on darker-skinned women. , Microsoft said that it had calready taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology and that it was investing in research cto recognize, understand and remove bias. , Ms. Buolamwini 9s co-author on her paper is Timnit Gebru, who described her role as an adviser. Ms. Gebru is a scientist at Microsoft Research, working on its [Fairness Accountability Transparency and Ethics in A.I. ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/fate/)group. , Megvii, whose Face++ software is widely used for identification in online payment and ride-sharing services in China, did not reply to several requests for comment, Ms. Buolamwini said. , Ms. Buolamwini is releasing her data set for others to build upon. She describes her research as ca starting point, very much a first step toward solutions. , Ms. Buolamwini is taking further steps in the technical community and beyond. She is working with the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://www.ieee.org/index.html), a large professional organization in computing, to set up a group to create standards for accountability and transparency in facial analysis software. , She meets regularly with other academics, public policy groups and philanthropies that are concerned about the impact of artificial intelligence. Darren Walker, president of the [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/), said that the new technology could be a cplatform for opportunity, but that it would not happen if it replicated and amplified bias and discrimination of the past. ,  cThere is a battle going on for fairness, inclusion and justice in the digital world, Mr. Walker said. , Part of the challenge, scientists say, is that there is so little diversity within the A.I. community.  ,  cWe 9d have a lot more introspection and accountability in the field of A.I. if we had more people like Joy, said Cathy O 9Neil, a data scientist and author of cWeapons of Math Destruction. , Technology, Ms. Buolamwini said, should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it 9s used on. ,  cYou can 9t have ethical A.I. that 9s not inclusive, she said. cAnd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards. ] ",

She and her husband threw water and supplies into a tiny closet under the stairs and huddled with their infant and 2-year-old, believing they were about to die.\\xa0 \"We grabbed everything we possibly could -- blankets, pillows, diapers, wipes, food, water bottles -- as I'm crying my eyes out,\" Thompson said. \"We called his parents, and I'm crying so hard that they can't understand me.\" It took 38 minutes for officials to send an alert retracting the warning because Hawaii did not have a standardized system for sending such corrections, the FCC said.\\xa0    The federal agency, which regulates the nation's airwaves and sets standards for such emergency alerts, criticized the state's delay in correcting it.\\xa0 The head of the FCC has called the error \"[absolutely unacceptable](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-false-ballistic-missile- alert-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-investigation/).\" Earlier this month,\\xa0[Miyagi gave CBS News correspondent David Begnaud a tour](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-hawaiis-emergency-alert-command- center/) of Hawaii's Emergency Alert Command Center and discussed what went wrong. During their conversation, Miyagi explained cellphone users weren't told about the error sooner because his agency didn't have procedures for issuing corrections. That has since changed 4 and two people will now be required to send out alerts in the future.\\xa0 The FCC said the state Emergency Management Agency has already taken steps to try to avoid a repeat of the false alert, requiring more supervision of drills and alert and test-alert transmissions. It has created a correction template for false alerts and has stopped ballistic missile defense drills until its own investigation is done. According to the FCC inquiry, the recorded message used for the drill began by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" -- the script for a drill, the FCC said. Then the recording used language that is typically used for a real threat, not a drill: \"this is not a drill.\" The recording ended by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise.\" However, the worker on duty did not hear the \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" part of the message and believed the threat was real, according to the employee's statement. The worker responded by sending the alert.  ] ",

To build a website I needed a computer, but no one in my family could afford one. Luckily, my relative gave me a Nokia 2690 phone. It wasn't very advanced, but adequate enough for me to learn the language of programming.  The new Zuckerberg? ![Nokia 2690 phone.](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) ![Nokia 2690 phone.](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180104171441-nokia-2690 -phone-large-169.jpg) Nokia 2690 phone. Once I had become a capable programmer, the idea for my first web project was sparked after I watched The Social Network movie, which about the founding of Facebook. I was inspired by Mark Zuckerberg. But I wanted to go further and create something better. At that time Facebook was set up to connect people you already knew, but I wanted to create a platform which connected everybody. After some time and a lot of effort, my attempt to replace Facebook fell through. I couldn't get enough users to sign up on the website. The few that signed up didn't stick around because there was only a few people to chat with.

I quickly moved onto my next idea: an app that makes it easy to send text messages to multiple people at once and at an affordable price. The cost of sending text messages in Nigeria was around $0.013, I planned on reducing it to $0.005. To build the app, I learned a new programming language called Java. I also needed to have a computer to compile the code, but I still couldn't afford one. Fortunately, I was able to find a way to build an app right on my Nokia phone, through an application called[ J2ME SDK Mobile](http://elvischidera.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/create-j2me-apps-with-your- mobile-phone.html). I spent days programming, carefully typing everything on the phone's small number pad.

We got some local press and grew to about 5,000 users. There were a few daily transactions, but over time, due in part to my inexperience (I was still only 14 years old), I was not able to keep up with the number of users and had to shut the app down. It was becoming clear that to take my programming skills to the next level I would need a computer. I cut my daily expenses and lived a simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop. Still, it wasn't enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job building a website to earn the remaining sum. How do you build a website for PC on a feature phone? Simple: have a Facebook friend you disturb every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback.

      "article": "[ AUTOMATION and globalisation have brought drastic changes to Western labour markets. Middle-skilled jobs are disappearing fast. In America, wages for blue-collar workers have been largely stagnant since the 1970s, whereas those for university graduates have soared. Silicon Valley types frequently warn that advances in technology, especially in artificial intelligence, will be devastating for low-skilled workers. One prominent study, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University, estimated that 47% of jobs in America could be automated over the next two decades. The spectre of mass unemployment, along with increasing levels of income equality, has led many policymakers to see investment in university as crucial for economic prosperity. Governments have plenty of reason to be bullish about higher education. Perhaps the best piece of evidence they have of the wisdom of investing more in universities is the graduate-wage premium 4the difference in wages between those with university degrees and those without. In their book cThe Race between Education and Technology d, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz of Harvard University point out that this premium fell during the first half of the 20th century in America as universities expanded enrolment, but started rising sharply around 1980. Although the premium has started to level off in recent years, the fact that university graduates still make around 70% more than non-graduates suggests that demand for skilled workers still far exceeds supply.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

While universities are places of learning, they are also social sorting mechanisms. Part of the reason why university graduates earn more is because they are brighter and harder-working to begin with. Some professionals, such as doctors or engineers, do require an extensive amount of technical training, but many do not. The fact that humanities graduates, whose courses often have little to do with their subsequent work, tend to earn more if they come from more prestigious institutions suggests that one reason for going to university is to get ahead of peers in the job market. Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, argues that earning a degree is like cstanding up at a concert d. Doing so improves your view of the show, but it comes at a cost to those sitting behind you. Across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, 43% of adults aged 25-34 now have tertiary degrees, up from 23% in 1995. Yet it is not clear to what extent these degrees have translated into economic gains. An analysis by _The Economist_ of American labour-market data finds that since 1970 the share of workers with degrees has increased in virtually every occupation. But in around half of occupations with better-educated workers average wages have still fallen in real terms. The ubiquity of the degree means that for many workers going to university is more of an obligation than a choice. Moreover, university does not suit all learners. Estimates of the economic returns to higher education tend to assume that all students will graduate. In practice, around 30% of students in Europe and 40% of students in America will drop out before earning their degrees. This means that the expected economic returns of a university education for average students are far lower than commonly understood. Governments are right to fret about training future workers, but they should look beyond just universities. ] ",

Some told stories of discussing long- hidden shame, others shared experiences of trauma using descriptions that were remarkably similar. Still others, like 83-year-old Geraldine Wallace, wrote in saying that she told her granddaughter that cI 9m glad your generation isn 9t putting up with this. , This week, after an anonymous allegation against Aziz Ansari was made public in an online magazine called [Babe](https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz- ansari-28355), those conversations seemed to take on a different tone. Women of all ages debated what the article, which recounted a date between a 23 -year-old woman known as cGrace and the actor in 2017, actually depicted. Was it, in Grace 9s words, a case of sexual assault 4 or was it merely a really bad date?

( cApparently there is a whole country full of young women who don 9t know how to call a cab, she wrote.) , Meanwhile, a 33-year-old staff editor and writer, Bari Weiss, wrote in The Times [Opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe- sexual-harassment.html?_r=0) section that Mr. Ansari was guilty of only one thing: Not being a mind reader. , In [Vox](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace- babe-me-too), [Jezebel](https://jezebel.com/babe-what-are-you- doing-1822114753) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/16/aziz-ansari- story-missed-opportunity), women in their 20s and 30s noted that while they considered the Babe piece to be poorly reported, it had sparked an important and necessary conversation about the complicated dynamics of sexual consent. , We gathered Ms. Weiss and two other Times staffers 4 ages 29 and 59 4 to talk sexual consent, metoo and the seeming generational divide. , **JESSICA BENNETT: This particular story has left me grappling with a particular question. Is it possible for something to be nonconsensual but** **also** **not sexual assault?** , **BARI WEISS, STAFF EDITOR AND WRITER, OPINION, 33** : One of the most remarkable aspects of this truly remarkable moment is that we are collectively and openly reassessing what we regard as kosher when sex and power is involved. But one of the more distressing and underreported aspects of this re-moralization is that some younger feminists are telling older feminists that they don 9t understand their own lives. They are telling women who experienced what they considered cbad dates or cbad sex that those experiences were, in fact, assault. Or worse. , Many older feminists I know are sitting there saying cHow dare you look at me 4 me who has kicked open the door of every room you occupy, who had to beg for the paid maternity leave you now enjoy, who endured the alienation of being the only woman at the table so that now you get to sit at its head 4 and tell me I 9m not self-aware enough to understand my own life? , **FAHIMA HAQUE, SOCIAL STRATEGY EDITOR, 29** : I probably sound salty but it doesn 9t surprise me that women, generationally, are differing on the MeToo movement. I am a younger feminist, but I 9m not an unthinking one who assumes I have no agency. I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I 9ve grappled with, nearly every day of my life, what needs to happen for men to be better and for women to feel strong enough to use their voice clearly to hold men accountable. So I fully admit that I 9m pretty militant about male behavior. , **SUSAN CHIRA, SENIOR GENDER CORRESPONDENT, 59** : I share my generation 9s general unease with labeling sexual awkwardness sexual assault. It 9s not only about refusing to see yourself as a victim, but also it 9s a fundamental act of fairness. I also think all generations are confronting that sex is an area of great uncertainty, vulnerability and, at times, abuse of power. Just because it 9s common to emerge from bad sexual encounters feeling bruised doesn 9t mean we shouldn 9t question why it 9s so common and what needs to change. , **There seems to be one thing some younger women have insisted on: That Aziz did abuse his power in the situation, even if it wasn 9t professional power. What do you think?** , **BW:** Refusing to give a factory worker a promotion unless she blows you? That is an abuse of power. Going on a date and hooking up 4 however boorishly 4 with another person? That is simply not an abuse of power. If we are going to weigh every relationship on the scales of power, well, then investment bankers won 9t be allowed to date baristas. We need to draw a bright line between what happens in the workplace and what happens in the privacy of our apartments (or kitchens). Right now they are getting conflated. , **SC:** I think it 9s crucial to make distinctions, and Aziz 9s accuser fell far short because she didn 9t. Yes, he was more powerful than she was 4 not only as a man who often takes the role of aggressor in sex, but also because of his celebrity. But he held no institutional power over her career or advancement. And yet if he behaved boorishly or insensitively, if he failed to pick up cues she may have been too embarrassed to verbalize, he, like other men who 9ve behaved this way, should be reflecting on why this encounter went so awry. , **Bari, you wrote this week that the only thing Aziz is guilty of is not being a mind reader. That 9s true, but Grace also describes expressing her discomfort in multiple places. Shouldn 9t we have a higher bar for men 9s emotional intelligence?** , **BW:** Absolutely. But that is not going to happen overnight. And until that blessed day of universal male emotional intelligence is upon us 4 or when someone figures out how to clone Jeff Goldblum 4 I want fewer women to be harassed, assaulted and raped. In part that means telling women to use their common sense. , **FH:** Aziz Ansari did write a (very good) book on modern romance, but this just highlights that even the most sensitive, thoughtful 4 dare I say 8woke 9 4 kind of man also has a lot to learn. We need to have a higher bar. , **Daphne Merkin, a critic and novelist, recently[made the point](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/opinion/golden-globes-metoo.html) in our Opinion section that we are treating women like frail Victorian-era housewives. I heard similar from a middle-aged friend, who wondered why Grace didn 9t cjust get up and leave. Thoughts?** , **FH:** The cget up and leave theory is, in theory, a good one. But that just feels ugly and callous in practice. It paints some women as strong warriors and others as weak fools. I will always respect first- and second- wave feminists for taking those crucial first steps for women 9s rights, but to shun the new wave of women because their approach is different is divisive. We won 9t move forward. I get that Grace 9s actions are grating, because ideally she would have felt confident enough in herself to leave. But I remember that at 23 it can be daunting to be the one who says no. , **SC:** Not sure this cuts generationally, though it may. That is, there are so many reasons women may be constrained from saying explicitly when they 9re uncomfortable, or they end up staying what turns out in hindsight to have been too long. Yes, it 9s important to learn to say no firmly. But we all know men don 9t always listen to that. And we also know that women themselves are often conflicted. Sex is always going to be messy and fumbling, to some degree. And I personally think we have to be tolerant of some uncertainty, some grayness. But if MeToo is going to spur real changes, men have to curb their sense of entitlement. , **Here 9s a question we get often from readers: What about due process? Is it really fair to place Aziz Ansari 9s name on the same spectrum as Harvey Weinstein?** , **BW:** Our current situation 4 guilty because accused, [as Margaret Atwood put it](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/am-i-a-bad- feminist/article37591823/) 4 is absolutely terrifying to me. And it should be to anyone that cares about justice and due process. , **FH:** The MeToo movement is the best part of social media. And trial by Twitter is the worst part of social media. But, most people aren 9t on Twitter exhaustively the way media folks are, so frankly while it 9s troubling that some bring out their 280-count pitchforks, I 9m just not too concerned that it 9s going to sideline the overall power and scope of such newfound, increased transparency. , **SC:** What 9s extraordinary 4 and deeply unsettling 4 is that MeToo gives women power that men have had for so long. Men could ruin reputations, undermine or destroy women 9s careers, act impulsively. I hope and believe that women can wield power more responsibly and more justly. , _This interview has been edited and condensed._ , _**Make a friend 9s day: Forward this email.**_ , _Get this from a friend?[Sign up here](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters /gender-issues). _ , _You can also read us[on the web](https://www.nytimes.com/series/metoo-moment) or listen to us on [WNYC 9s The Takeaway](https://www.wnyc.org/series /metoo-memos-understanding-cultural-moment). _ , _Share your feedback at[nytgender@nytimes.com](mailto:nytgender@nytimes.com)._ ] ",

Where do morals come from? What is the difference between Jesus in the Bible and in other scriptures? These are just some of the questions the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) says that secondary school pupils grapple with on a regular basis. But the REC is warning that a shortage of religious education teachers could contribute to religious stereotyping and discrimination, leaving pupils at risk of becoming ignorant, or bigoted. It says high quality specialist teaching about all faiths, beliefs and world views is essential in a diverse society and is launching a campaign to try to attract more teachers into the profession. Government data shows that in 2017-18, only 405 of initial teacher training places in England for RE were filled - well below the target of 643; figures for Wales have not yet been published.    The figures come against a backdrop of [schools struggling to retain existing teachers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42873153) \\- last month a report found the number of qualified teachers leaving the profession (for reasons other than retirement) had increased from 6% (25,260) of the qualified workforce in 2011 to 8% (34,910) in 2016.  'The big mysteries of life' For Lynsey Wilkinson, head of religious education at Redhill Academy in Arnold near Nottingham, RE is important, given the range of views and opinions to which pupils are exposed. \"We live in a dynamic ever-changing society full of different perspectives, beliefs and cultures,\" says Miss Wilkinson. \"Learning about these things helps the pupils in my classroom see the world clearly and helps them develop a genuine understanding about the world and the people in it. \"And that understanding will help them to shape the society of the future - a better society.\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Miss Wilkinson says that while she does not have a religious faith herself, it's exhilarating to debate big questions of life with pupils. \"I don't consider myself religious, but there's an academic side to RE that's fascinating to me - the idea of approaching these huge concepts from an intellectual point of view is one I've developed a real passion for. \"I spend my day helping these tirelessly curious kids get to grips with the big mysteries of life, examining spiritual beliefs, walking them through abstract philosophical concepts and getting into spirited debates over morals and ethics.\"  'At risk of ignorance' Rudolf Eliott Lockhart, chief executive of the REC, says specialist teachers are crucial for keeping young people properly informed. \"Without good quality religious education delivered by a qualified RE teacher, who provides accurate and balanced information about the array of different world views that make up modern Britain, young people are placed at risk. \"Not only are they at risk of ignorance that might lead to misunderstanding or even bigotry, but as they go through life, they risk basing their knowledge, understanding and opinions on sources that perpetuate inaccurate and misleading stereotypes. If and when those prejudices and falsehoods surface in the classroom, well trained teachers of RE are equipped to challenge and correct them. \"With information and opinion so freely available on social media and other online sources, pupils need to be taught to differentiate between sources that are reliable and reputable and those that are more likely to lead to religious discrimination and hatred. \"It is clear that in Britain today, we need to develop a better understanding of different faiths and beliefs so that we build more cohesive communities. In a world where religious literacy is now a vital skill in all walks of life, the shortage of qualified RE teachers is a deep concern and needs to be urgently addressed.\"  What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Religious education remains compulsory at each key stage for all state-funded schools, including academies and free schools, and we expect all schools to fulfil their statutory duties. \"In addition, we have changed the law and the requirements in schools so that they have to actively promote mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.\" A spokesman for the Welsh government said: \"We are currently reforming the way in which initial teacher education is delivered - putting in place new accreditation criteria and strengthening the ways in which schools and universities work together. \"An advisory board has also been established to consider issues of teacher recruitment and retention. \"We believe that this, together with a new curriculum, a new approach to our foundation phase and a commitment to professional learning will help us attract the very best teachers.\"  ] ",

In his first public speech since taking up the post, Mr Hinds said schools needed a mix of traditional academic subjects and a sense of \"resilience\" and skills such as public speaking. Mr Hinds said that a high proportion of new jobs would require digital skills. He also called for improvements in vocational training for adults. The education secretary said young people needed the skills to be able to \"write apps\" as well as being able to use them.    He said lessons in computing were needed to prepare young people for industries being changed by artificial intelligence and the arrival of technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Speaking at the Education World Forum in London, Mr Hinds emphasised the need for both \"core academic subjects\" and other, \"soft skills\" that could make young people more employable.  'Sports and voluntary work' But in his first presentation since becoming education secretary in the recent ministerial reshuffle, he gave few clues about any significant change in direction. Instead, Mr Hinds focused on how schools needed to prepare people for a shifting jobs market - and the importance of skills in communication and developing character. \"I would suggest that there is nothing soft about these skills,\" he told this international education gathering. \"The hard reality of soft skills is, actually, these things around the workplace, and these things around character and resilience are important for anybody to achieve in life, as well as for the success of our economy,\" said Mr Hinds. He stressed the importance of the \"ethos of a school, the expectations set for students\" and activities such as \"sport, public speaking and voluntary work\". Mr Hinds said these would shape the \"character, resilience and workplace skills that our young people take with them\". The new education secretary also pointed to the importance of helping adults to retrain for a changing jobs market. The conference heard that the UK's economy could receive a huge financial boost if there were improvements in the levels of basic skills. Andreas Schleicher, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) director of education, said that a fifth of 15-year-olds in the UK struggled to achieve even the most basic levels in maths and reading. \"If the United Kingdom were to ensure that all students had at least basic skills, the economic gains could reach $3.6 trillion (\\xa32.58trn) in additional income for the economy over the working life of these students,\" he told the conference. On the basis of standards rising in other countries, Mr Schleicher said: \"Such improvements in educational performance are entirely realistic.\"  ] ",

(AP Photo/Press Trust of India, File) NEW DELHI 4\\xa0It 9s only the fourth day of annual examinations in India 9s largest state of Uttar Pradesh and already the government says 661,643 students\\xa0 4 around 10 percent of the total number enrolled\\xa0 4 have failed to show up. A government official said it 9s because this year they've upped their anti-cheating efforts, and clamped down on the state 9s notorious education mafia by installing CCTV cameras and deploying a police task force to catch the cheaters. India 9s hugely competitive examination system coupled with poor teaching\\xa0standards in schools has seen the growth of a massive cheating industry in recent decades. Students need top marks\\xa0 4 sometimes over 99 percent 4 to get into the country 9s highly oversubscribed universities and so examiners are bribed, answer sheets leaked and exam rooms infiltrated. No more,\\xa0said Neena Srivastava, secretary of the Uttar Pradesh board of education, who described the ccheating mafia as part of organized crime. cWe are fighting against this evil. We have to cleanse the state of this menace. To\\xa0curb cheating, Uttar Pradesh 9s education minister, Dinesh Sharma[ told](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/crackdown-on- education-mafia-will-enhance-up-boards-brand-value-dy-cm-dinesh- sharma/articleshow/62841391.cms) Times of India that the government 9s new measures this year included clamping down on suspicious exam centers and firing lax district inspectors. Top scorers would have their exam sheets published, he said, so everyone could see how they performed. cIn the cheating racket, genuine students are worst sufferers, he said. Without the option of cheating, thousands of\\xa0students are simply not showing up.\\xa0Others are taking their chances. In one school, a teacher was caught dictating answers to students, despite CCTV cameras being turned on, according to[ Scroll](https://scroll.in/latest/867936/over-1-8-lakh-students- absent-on-the-first-day-of-the-uttar-pradesh-board-examinations). In another,[ Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/five- arrested-for-abetting-cheating/articleshow/62814191.cms?) reported,\\xa0five people including a school principal\\xa0were arrested for facilitating mass cheating. India 9s rapid development has seen a huge demand for college graduates in the past\\xa0three decades. Aspiring young Indians hope to rise above their parents 9 status and take a portion of the growing pie of wealth in cities. But getting into those colleges requires top scores in state-level exams. So crucial are school exams to ordinary Indian families, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi even penned a new book released this month called cExam Warriors giving young Indians top tips for exam success. Among them are doing yoga, using acronyms as a learning device, and laughing as you enter and leave the exam hall. But even Modi 9s exam mantras can 9t surmount the chronic problems of India 9s education system. Schools are often understaffed, teachers absent, and curricula is focused on rote learning. In villages, schools sometimes don 9t have electricity or the right textbooks. A\\xa0lack of toilets and running water, especially for menstruating girls, leads to high dropout rates. Srivastava and others, intent on cleaning up the exam system, said the tough new anti-cheating measures will deter future cheaters. cChildren should study. Teachers should give better and timely education. Children should not be enticed into these nefarious activities. Exams will end March 12. ] ",

His school district, which contains some of the poorest pupils\\xa0in the nation, has been under state control since 2001, an arrangement that will end this year. Proficiency in reading and maths lags about 30 percentage points behind the rest of the state. To boost results the district has turned to proliferating charter schools, which receive public funds but have independent management and now educate one in three children in the district. Twenty-one low-performing public schools, christened cRenaissance schools d, have been turned over to charter operators. At a school-board meeting on February 15th vocal charter supporters, mostly black parents frustrated with poor local schools, confronted angry, mostly white, teachers.  cI can 9t and I won 9t let my sons down, testified Rasheeda Fossey, whose children are in the school system.

That is despite the appointment of Betsy DeVos, a longtime funder of school-choice efforts, as secretary of education. The federal government pays for less than 10% of public-school funds. Control is devolved to states and school districts, leaving the education secretary rather weak in setting policy. At a recent breakfast put on by school-choice advocates on Capitol Hill for Republican congressional staffers, Ms DeVos was not mentioned once. She may have had more influence as a deep-pocketed donor, who helped the rapid expansion in charter schools in Michigan, than as education secretary. States, especially those governed by Republicans, are expanding schemes such as vouchers and education savings accounts, where the state transfers cash directly to parents. Spending on such programmes, which now include 470,000 children, has tripled as a share of education expenses in the past ten years, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group.\\xa0Charter schools now educate 3.1m pupils, a sevenfold increase since 2000. In New Orleans, which rebuilt its woeful education system after Hurricane Katrina, 93% of pupils are now educated in charters, where they have made considerable improvement. Other urban school districts are not as far along as New Orleans, but many are emulating it. Cities like Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Washington, where 46% of pupils are enrolled in charters, are examples of a growing cportfolio model movement. Under this approach, school districts treat their charter and traditional public-school offerings much as stock-pickers do their financial portfolios, by strenuously monitoring performance and quickly ridding themselves of low-performing assets. Rather than creating unfettered markets, where the ready availability of public cash can attract unscrupulous providers, technocrats wield a heavy cudgel 4the threat of closure 4to force accountability. The financial analogy of cportfolio model d, and its association with Michael Bloomberg when he was mayor of New York City, has made the term pejorative among those who talk of education being privatised. But the portfolio model is actually less like a pure market in education, because it takes choices away from parents, many of whom are attached to their local school, no matter how mediocre. Paul Hill, the intellectual progenitor of the portfolio model, reckons that 40 school districts, most of them large and urban, have now adopted this method. Even with their impressive growth, charters educate only 7% of American pupils. The grand experiment can be justified on two grounds. The first is moral 4there is inherent good in being able to pick schools. cParents 9 right to choice is really the civil-rights issue of the 21st century, says John Schilling, president of the American Federation for Children, which Ms DeVos once chaired and helped found. cLow-income parents should also have the ability to send their kids where they want, he adds. The second justification for choice is pragmatic 4to spur competition and innovation which would cdrag education out of the 19th century d, as Milton Friedman put it. For this crowd, outcomes are important. But, like the traditional public schools they seek to replace, charter schools tend to produce uneven results. The best nationwide study, by researchers at Stanford University, suggests they have little overall effect on learning. Detroit 9s charters, which Ms DeVos pushed mightily, are widely seen as a mess. Students in Philadelphia 9s charters do better in reading exams, but not in maths. The evidence on school vouchers is similarly uninspiring, with little gain in test scores and only marginal increases in graduation rates. Pupils who took part in Indiana and Louisiana 9s voucher schemes posted significantly worse results than those who remained in the public-school system. Treating schools like a portfolio, where bad ones are quickly pushed out of business, might work a bit better.

Historically, though, it has lacked charm and lovability, and paradoxically, beyond its commercial ties, Bordeaux has had little connection with the wine producers in the growing regions that define the region and practically surround the city. , But an ambitious wine museum that opened in the city of Bordeaux on the west bank of the river in 2016 is working to change that. While capturing the worldwide culture of wine in a modern, immersive, multimedia style, [La Cit\\xe9 du Vin](http://www.laciteduvin.com/en) hopes to serve as a critical link between the urban center of the wine trade and the myriad producers who have historically stood apart. , Simply as a cultural center, the City of Wine succeeds brilliantly in many ways. As a symbol, the curvaceous, contemporary building designed by [XTU](https://www.designboom.com/tag/xtu-architects/), a Parisian architecture firm, swirls up from the riverside not unlike the Guggenheim Museum flowing upward on staid Fifth Avenue. As a statement, it says that hidebound, conservative Bordeaux is no more. , Situated between the districts of Chartrons, the historic center of the wine trade, and Bacalan, a docks and manufacturing area, La Cit\\xe9 anchors a growing tourist hub, which includes a huge, concrete German bunker that once housed [U-boats](https://uboat.net/flotillas/bases/bordeaux.htm) during the Nazi occupation and is now being transformed into an underground arts center. , The few wine museums I have visited around the world have never quite fired the imagination. The more ambitious the museum, the more transparently promotional it is for a particular region, a certain producer or the benefits of wine. The most successful have been the most local, which have simply presented artifacts without forced narratives. , But La Cit\\xe9 consciously avoids the outright promotion and celebration of Bordeaux. Instead, it takes an ecumenical approach, looking at the scope of wine culture worldwide and letting history 4 and the people who make the wines 4 speak largely for themselves. ,  cThe challenge was to tell ourselves, 8We 9re not promoting wine, we 9re promoting wine culture, 9 said Sylvie Cazes, who was instrumental in pushing the Cit\\xe9 du Vin project forward both as a member of the Bordeaux City Council from 2008 to 2014, and as part of an important Bordeaux wine family that owns [Ch\\xe2teau Lynch- Bages](https://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/bordeaux-wine-producer- profiles/bordeaux/pauillac/lynch-bages/), among other properties. , [Vinexpo Bordeaux](http://www.vinexpo.com/events/vinexpo-bordeaux), a vast wine trade exposition held every two years, was a particular inspiration, she said. ,  cVinexpo works because all the wines of the world take part, Ms. Cazes said. cThat made it a success. , La Cit\\xe9 encompasses 10 levels, including a wine bar, a retail shop, exhibition spaces, areas for special tastings, a theater (named for Thomas Jefferson) and, on the top floor, a panoramic restaurant with gorgeous views of the city. , But at its heart is a permanent exhibition of 19 themed spaces that provide an overview of the world 9s vineyards, the development of domesticated grapevines, the intricacies of how wine is made, the nuances of tasting and drinking it, and historical presentations on transporting wine and enjoying it dating from 6000 B.C. , Ultimately, it poses the existential question of why humans have gone to such extreme efforts to create a beverage that is not essential to existence. , Upon arrival, visitors are issued a ccompanion du voyage, individual electronic guides about the size of cellphones that connect directly with each stop along the tour, explaining in eight languages exactly what you are looking at and how to interact with it. From there, you are on your own, free to wander among the exhibits at your own pace, in your own fashion. , You might begin with a dizzying virtual helicopter tour of the world 9s vineyards, a sweeping overview that spans the globe in about 15 minutes on three big, curved screens. Or you could watch winemakers discussing their vineyards, from the famous, like [Dominique Lafon](http://www.decanter.com/wine/producer-profiles/domaine-des-comtes- lafon-producer-profile-245913/) in [Meursault Perri\\xe8res](https://www.wine- searcher.com/regions-meursault+perrieres), one of the great sources of white Burgundy, to a monsignor at [Alaverdi Monastery Wine Cellar](http://www.winesgeorgia.com/site/domaine/alaverdi-monastery-wine- cellar) in the country of Georgia, one of the cradles of wine civilization, where techniques have changed little over centuries. , The videos are so sharp that at one point I found I could not pay attention to the winemaker Wilhelm Haag of [Fritz Haag](http://weingut-fritz- haag.de/vineyards/), a fine riesling producer in the Mosel region of Germany, because the backdrop 4 the astoundingly steep Juffer Sonnenuhr vineyard 4 distracted me with its beauty. , Displays explain how vines and grapes were domesticated, how they occupied exalted mythological positions within ancient societies and how vines adapt to wildly different terrains. , Atmospheric enhancements penetrate almost unconsciously as you examine the exhibit: birds singing, thunder, the sound of a helicopter. Later, while learning about the use of barrels and how wine evolves in them over time, I suddenly became aware that I was smelling oak, used in the construction of the display. , Not all the exhibits are so straightforwardly historic. A buffet table offers the opportunity for cindulging in the sensory experience of wine tasting, offering surprisingly effective examples of different aromas and textures, and the opportunity to test your nose if so inclined. , I especially enjoyed an animated presentation of how wine merchants through the ages challenged themselves over millenniums to transport wine overseas to customers who craved it. It 9s not strictly realistic, as one character chides a god: cYou 9re all the same. You have eternity but no patience. , The entire visit can take about two hours to complete, by which time you are ready for the glass of wine included with admission. , The permanent exhibition is geared toward anyone who wants to learn more about wine. La Cit\\xe9 also puts on two temporary exhibits a year, in conjunction with other wine regions, which go deeply into particular subjects like wine and art, or wine and music. , In its first year, Ms. Cazes said, 445,000 visitors came to the museum, which far surpassed initial projections. , One particularly hopeful sign for La Cit\\xe9 is that the city of Bordeaux is now attracting more visitors. Once drab and dirty, with few interesting places to visit or eat, [Bordeaux has undergone a transformation in the last 15 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/travel/what-to-do-in-bordeaux.html). , The facades of its 18th- and 19th-century architecture, once gray with filth, are now sparkling. An extensive new tram system offers an easy-to-use mass transit network, and the narrow streets of the old city are bustling with busy restaurants and wine bars. In truth, many of the wine bars are so hip that it 9s much easier to find [natural wines](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/dining/natural-raw-wine-fair.html) than it is to get a bottle of good, old Bordeaux. , As for whether La Cit\\xe9 can help to bridge the divide between the city and its surrounding wine industry, tourism will play a central role in whether it succeeds. The museum will serve as a point of departure for tours of the M\\xe9doc, the historic area encompassing the famous areas of Margaux, St.-Julien and Pauillac. Some will go by bus. Others will leave by boat from La Cit\\xe9, heading up the Garonne to the Gironde Estuary. , Tourism has not historically been encouraged in Bordeaux estates, Ms. Cazes said. Cellars were not equipped for visits and, she said, merchants in Bordeaux were concerned that visitors would buy wine directly from the producers rather than through their networks. , Indeed, the Bordeaux tourist board has a desk within La Cit\\xe9, she said, and is eager to sell tickets for tours. , _[Follow NYT Food on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nytfood/), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nytfood), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nytfood) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/nytfood/).

Academics at Durham University found the \"apparent success\" of these wholly selective schools was down to their brighter and more advantaged pupils. They say increasing the number of schools that select pupils by ability would be dangerous for equality. The government said it was working to widen access to grammar schools. Grammar schools have a reputation for high academic achievement and dominate the top of the school league tables.     'Social segregation' But this research, based on the detailed results of nearly 550,000 pupils, suggests once the ability and social background of pupils is taken into account, grammar schools are no more or less effective than other schools. The research not only looked at the social backgrounds of grammar pupils, but also:   * rates of chronic poverty   * ethnicity   * home language   * special educational needs   * age in the year group  The findings suggest England's grammars take only a tiny proportion of pupils who are, or have been, eligible for free school meals.  Image copyrightGetty Images This is important, say the researchers, because such pupils' results tend to decline with every year they are on free meals. This means that other schools in selective areas are taking more than their fair share of the poorest and chronically poor pupils. The Conservative government had to abandon plans to allow new grammar schools to open, following its weak position in Parliament after the general election. But ministers are keen to continue to allow existing grammars to expand.  'No clear gain' An [analysis of pupil numbers by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42416365) showed the equivalent of 11 new selective schools had been created since 2010 as existing schools had expanded. Prof Stephen Gorard, from Durham's School of Education, said: \"Dividing children into the most able and the rest from an early age does not appear to lead to better results for either group. \"This means that the kind of social segregation experienced by children in selective areas in England, and the damage to social cohesion that ensues, is for no clear gain. \"This is not to decry the schools that are currently grammars, or the work of their staff. \"However, the findings mean that grammar schools in England endanger social cohesion for no clear improvement in overall results. The policy is a bad one.\" A Department for Education official said: \"We want every child to receive a world-class education and to give parents greater choice when it comes to picking the school that's right for them - grammar schools are a part of this. \"Around 60% of these schools already prioritise admissions for disadvantaged children, and we are continuing to work closely with the school sector to widen access further. \"Research shows that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds make better progress across core subjects in selective schools, and attain better results.\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: \"There is a wealth of evidence that selection at 11 works against the government's stated ambition of improving social mobility. \"Creating new grammars schools is not the best way to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Instead, greater investment in high quality early years education would have a bigger impact on life chances - 11 is too late to bridge the gap.\"  ] ",

(Alex Brandon/AP) _This post has been updated._ Teresa Manning 4 an antiabortion activist in charge of the Health and Human Services Department 9s family planning programs 4 resigned her post Friday, according to a department spokeswoman. Manning, who served as deputy assistant secretary for the [Office of Population Affairs](https://www.hhs.gov/opa/), has spent much of her career fighting abortion and has publicly questioned the efficacy of several popular contraception methods. Her job included overseeing the Title X program, which provides family-planning funding for about 4 million poor Americans or those without health insurance. In an email Friday evening, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley confirmed Manning 9s resignation but did not provide\\xa0a reason for her abrupt departure.  cHHS would like to thank her for her service to this Administration and the American people, Oakley said. Manning was escorted from the building by security officials Friday.\\xa0 According to an HHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter, Manning already had turned in her badge and the escort allowed her to get back out through security. Her resignation does not appear to represent a major ideological shift in the department, since Valerie Huber, a prominent abstinence education advocate, has been named acting deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Population Affairs. Huber has served as chief of staff in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health since June. Manning, who was [appointed by President Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/01/trump- picks-antiabortion-activist-to-head-hhs-family-planning-program/) last May, formerly lobbied for the National Right to Life Committee and worked as a legislative analyst for the Family Research Council. She was one of several antiabortion activists and leaders Trump has picked for key positions at the agency. Like many conservatives who oppose abortion rights, Manning has repeatedly objected to the use of RU-486, or\\xa0mifepristone, which is often used with misoprostol\\xa0to trigger an abortion during the early stages of a pregnancy, as well as the morning-after pill. But she also has expressed deep skepticism of birth control overall, suggesting in a 2003 interview with NPR that ccontraception doesn 9t work.  cIts efficacy is very low, especially when you consider over years 4 which a lot of contraception health advocates want to start women in their adolescent years, when they 9re extremely fertile, incidentally, and continue for 10, 20, 30 years. The prospect that contraception would always prevent the conception of a child is preposterous, Manning said at the time. Abortion-rights activists protested Manning 9s appointment, saying someone opposed to contraception shouldn 9t oversee Title X. Her replacement has long advocated for abstinence education. Huber managed Ohio 9s abstinence program from 2004 to 2007 and subsequently led Ascend, a group initially founded as the National Abstinence Education Association. She says she prefers to use the term csexual risk avoidance, telling Focus on the Family 9s Citizen magazine that Ascend 9s mission is broader than telling teens not to have sex.  cI bristle at the terminology 8abstinence only, 9 because our programs are so holistic, Huber said. cThey contextualize a whole battery of different topics that surround a young person 9s decision whether to have sex or not. Rather than someone telling a young person, 8Do this, don 9t do that, 9 it 9s casting a vision for a young person 9s future. Some family planning advocates, such as Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive at the nonprofit Power to Decide, criticized the administration 9s decision to put Huber in charge of the Office of Population Affairs.  cManning 9s departure would be positive news except for the fact that the Trump administration has chosen to replace Manning with Valerie Huber, who is well known for placing ideology over an evidence-based approach to ensuring that young people have the information and services they need to avoid an unplanned pregnancy, said Ehrlich, whose group backs federal support for sex education and a wide range of contraception methods. cWhat we really need is for this administration to take women 9s health issues seriously and appoint an individual who is not only\\xa0well qualified for the position, but also values women. **Read more:** [Behind closed doors, Trump signs bill allowing states to strip federal family planning funds from abortion providers\\xa0 ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/04/13/behind-closed- doors-trump-signs-bill-allowing-states-to-strip-federal-family-planning- dollars-from-abortion-providers/?tid=a_mcntx&utm_term=.f918c0204c7c) [Trump administration narrows Affordable Care Act 9s contraception mandate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump- administration-could-narrow-affordable-care-acts-contraception- mandate/2017/10/05/16139400-a9f0-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html) \\xa0 ] ",

A rise in the number of 18-year-olds by 2030 will push demand up by 50,000, the Higher Education Policy Institute says. A further 350,000 places will be needed to keep pace with the existing growing participation rate, it adds, but other factors may reduce that by 50,000. The government has set up a review of university fees and funding. Last year, 534,000 students were accepted on to the hundreds of mainly three- year degree courses on offer in England.    The Hepi report examines the impact of policy changes on university entrant rates, feeding a number of scenarios into the calculations to arrive at the 300,000 figure. The 18-year-old population has been declining steadily for a number of years, but from 2020 it will increase again, rising by nearly 23% by 2030, says Hepi.  Questions for future It estimates there will be 14,709 additional entrants arising from demography alone, which will amount to about 50,000 additional students by 2030. And if participation continues to increase at the current rate, about 350,000 extra places will be needed on top. Countervailing factors such as Brexit, are likely to reduce that total by about 50,000, the research says. Currently, more women than men go to university. And if males were to increase their rates of participation, the research says, 500,000 extra places would be needed in total by 2030. It notes that there is not much sign of a change ahead in this area but cautions that the higher education system would come under great pressure and require a comprehensive reassessment if there was.  'Large increase' Bahram Bekhradnia, one of the authors and Hepi president, said as nearly every new student required a government-subsidised loan, \"it is difficult to see - under the current finance model - how the policy of uncapped student recruitment can continue\". \"This is particularly pertinent given the constraints on public expenditure and the absence of any suggestion from the Treasury that more money will be available for higher education in the future,\" he added. The report says the policy consequences of this very likely large increase in demand need to be considered. \"Given the extent of the loan subsidy provided for student loans... the higher education budget will need to be significantly increased in order to meet the financial consequences,\" it says. They suggest a cap on student numbers may have to be reintroduced. A DfE spokesperson said: there were more people going to university than ever before - including record numbers of 18-year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds entering full-time. \"We want anyone with the talent and potential to have the opportunity to go to university, which is why we lifted the cap on student numbers and reduced barriers that people face. \"We are conducting a major review of post-18 education to ensure that the system provides genuine choice for young people, and students and taxpayers are getting value for money.\"  ] ",

      "article": "[ LE\\xd3N, Mexico 4 Landon Donovan, the most celebrated player in the history of American soccer, was driving home from the store this week in this industrial city in Central Mexico when he spotted a man on the side of the road selling pineapples. , The pineapples were two for 50 pesos 4 about $2.70. Donovan gave the vendor 100 pesos and told him to keep the change. As he drove away, Donovan saw the man cross himself and look to the sky. , It was a small moment, probably forgettable for most people, but it resonated for the 36-year-old Donovan. For him, it stood in sharp contrast to the venom that marked so many of his previous interactions with strangers in a country that for years reviled him as the living embodiment of its bitter soccer rivalry with the United States. , It was also the kind of benign, ordinary exchange Donovan has been reveling in since moving to Mexico, a country he visited regularly as a player over the course of two decades but, by his own admission, never really got to know. , It has been just over two months since Donovan was lured out of retirement by Club Le\\xf3n, a storied team now lurking in the middle of the standings in Liga MX, Mexico 9s top division. , In purely soccer terms, the move has been a test of patience: Donovan has spent most of the games since he arrived sitting on the bench. But with his wife, Hannah, and their two young sons in tow, it has also been a chance for him to reset his relationship with Mexico, a soccer-crazed country where he may be more widely known than in the United States 4 though also widely loathed. , For years, as the soccer rivalry deepened between the neighboring countries, Mexican animosity toward the American team seemed to concentrate with laserlike focus on Donovan. He did not shy from this role, stoking the fires with provocative comments and once even urinating near the field at Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara [before a practice](https://youtu.be/vJS9r5MWD3w?t=55s), an act that was caught on video and has never been forgotten in Mexico. , During matches in Mexico, particularly at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, fans greeted every touch of the ball by Donovan with searing choruses of jeers and epithets, and they bombarded him with cups and coins and [sometimes far worse](http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer-news/2958947-us-mens-national-team- guatemala-world-cup-qualifying-match-tv-television) as he set up for corner kicks. , In an interview in 2012, Donovan took some of the blame for this caustic relationship, admitting he had been c[a punk kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liQMaVZY_uM&feature=youtu.be&t=2m30s) earlier in his career. cI ran my mouth a lot and I said a lot of stupid things and I was very ignorant and I caused a lot of, probably, hatred toward me, he said. , But he was viewed by many in Mexico as a worthy adversary, with his playing prowess 4 and ability and willingness to conduct interviews in Spanish 4 earning him a grudging respect. Late in his career, perhaps in a sign of a softening in the relationship, Donovan appeared in [a series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Dz0wD1jeQ) [of ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6zsw2rec6Q) for the Mexican lottery that played off the country 9s distaste for him. ,  cMexicans hated him in a joyous way, said Robert Andrew Powell, author of cThis Love Is Not for Cowards, a book about soccer and violence in Ju\\xe1rez, a Mexican border city. cThey got a lot of pleasure out of hating him. , Donovan has often said that he owes his career in part to Mexicans, specifically the immigrants and their children he played soccer with while growing up in Southern California. Had he grown up in a place where the sport was not a central part of the culture, he said, he might never have taken it up. , Still, despite all the times he played in Mexico as a member of the United States national team, he said, he never really saw or experienced much of the country beyond its airports and hotels and the infernal caldron of its stadiums. , The Le\\xf3n offer, he said, was a chance to set aside a cpretty simple and easy life of family and daily recreational tennis in California and really get to know the country in a deeper, more meaningful way. ,  cWhen this opportunity came up at first, it was a hard no, Donovan said in an interview this week. But the team persisted, and in short order, Donovan was on a plane to Le\\xf3n to check it out. He attended a match, met the team and the coaching staff, and took a tour of the city. ,  cThe only Mexico I 9ve really known is Cabo San Lucas, where you don 9t really leave the hotel, or Mexico City or Guadalajara for games, he said. cSo all I see is the hotel, a drive to the stadium where people are yelling at you, cursing at you. In the stadium, people are throwing stuff at you, booing you. That 9s the only Mexico I 9d ever known in a real way. So having the chance to just see it through a different lens was really enjoyable, even for just that 24 hours. , With his wife 9s encouragement, he signed a one-year deal. , Donovan quickly turned his decision into something of a political statement, taking an apparent swipe at President Trump 9s proposed border wall in a Twitter post. ,  cI don 9t believe in walls, I want to go to Mexico, dress in green and win trophies in Le\\xf3n, [he wrote](https://twitter.com/landondonovan/status/952033551754522624), endearing himself to Le\\xf3n fans and to Mexicans more broadly. , The Le\\xf3n fan base 4 or a significant part of it 4 was quick to shelve its grievances and welcome him. On Jan. 15, he landed at the regional airport and was whisked to Le\\xf3n 9s stadium where, even though it was 9 p.m. on a Monday, more than 7,000 fans turned out to greet him. , In some quarters of the city, however, the club 9s decision to bring an aging former star out of retirement, no matter how good he may have been, was viewed as a cynical act of marketing with only a marginal chance of helping the team 9s performance. , But interviews with a range of fans outside the Le\\xf3n stadium last Saturday evening, before the team 9s most recent game, reflected a generosity of spirit toward Donovan, even if he has made only six appearances 4 all as a late-second-half substitute 4 in nine league and cup matches since joining the roster. , Alan Garc\\xeda, 25, a Le\\xf3n fan who works in a store that sells air compressors, said the news of Donovan 9s signing cwas like a bomb for us. ,  cWhat us fans are asking for is that they give him more playing time, he added. , But there would be none for Donovan that night. He remained a shadow on the bench in a 2-2 draw against Lobos BUAP, a team from the city of Puebla, and avoided reporters by ducking onto the team bus afterward. , Donovan acknowledged some irritation at his lack of playing time in the interview days later at the team 9s practice facility, a bare-bones compound, with three soccer fields and a weight room, at the end of an unmarked dirt road. ,  cI just want to help, and that 9s where it gets frustrating, he said. But his maturity, he said, has helped to keep his frustrations in check. Instead, he has been trying to help the club in other ways, providing guidance to younger players and setting an example on and off the field. , At the practice facility, he was unfailingly courteous to the grounds crew and other staff members, greeting everyone he encountered. An intern working for the team said Donovan, unlike most of the team 9s players, frequently stopped by the offices to say hello to the staff before heading to the locker room. , His schedule has been relentless: He did not have a day off until last weekend, and he seized the opportunity to take his family to San Miguel de Allende, a colonial city popular with tourists. There, as with everywhere else he has gone, strangers recognized him on the street and greeted him warmly, eager to talk about the team and soccer. ,  cHad I come here to live as a U.S. soccer player, it 9s different because they don 9t view you as one of their own, he said. But now that he had joined a Mexican team, he had, in essence, become a welcome part of Mexico 9s fabric. , While Donovan and his family 9s home is in a guarded residential enclave, he said they tried to live their lives as normally as possible, venturing out often to eat at the city 9s restaurants and shop at its stores. Even his decision to take his family with him, rather than leaving them in San Diego, was a commitment to a fully immersive experience, despite his initial and very serious concerns about the country 9s reputation for violence. , It 9s also why his thoughts during an interview easily returned to the pineapple salesman, to the few moments of pleasantries exchanged at the roadside, to the 50 pesos left behind as a tip and a thank you. In a country that once cursed the mere mention of his name, Donovan is now revealing a kinder face, and receiving one in return. ,  cThey 9re hardworking, they 9re nice people, they 9re trying to do good, they 9re trying to support their families, he said. ,  cIt 9s a perception I would never have had if I had just gone to Mexico City, to the Azteca, back to the hotel and back to the United States. And now I have such a greater appreciation for all of it. ] ",

Several members of my family, who had been chatting animatedly over mugs of hot sweet tea, were abruptly silent. We were all packed in a modest hotel room in Rameswaram, an island off the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The unnatural moment of stillness was instantly noticeable for two reasons - the sudden peal of rain beating against the windows, and the fact that there is rarely silence when my family, who live on three continents and talk every day on WhatsApp, get to be together. My aunt, who had been lying casually on her hotel bed, stood up to reach for her handbag. She pulled out a sanitary towel and handed it over to me.    \"This will tide you over until we can stop by a pharmacy,\" she said. And looking rather sadly at me, she added: \"You know what this means, don't you?\" I didn't. \"You won't be able to come to the temple.\"  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption The \"holy baths\" at Rameswaram, where people take a dip to pay their respects to ancestors  Our family were not holidaying in Rameswaram. Although tourism and fishery are the two dominant industries of the 60 sq km (23 sq miles) island, we were there for a very specific and sombre reason. It had been a year since the death of my beloved grandmother, the glue that kept our trans-continental family close. On hearing the news of her death last December, we had all taken the next available flight to attend her funeral.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption Tamil Nadu is a popular pilgrimage destination. A recent fire at Meenakshi temple destroyed dozens of shops  There are numerous traditions in Hindu culture surrounding death, depending on which part of India you're from. My family observes a set of South Indian Hindu rituals for the death of someone close. We took her body back to our family home, wrapped her in white cotton, laid her on a large banana leaf and prayed together. The men took her body for cremation - a moment I wished I could have attended. We hadn't eaten meat for 15 days after her death. We performed a special ceremony 90 days after. We said our goodbyes to each other at the airport, promising that we would meet again for the next stage of the ritual, the final chapter of our mourning, at Rameswaram - a well-known Hindu pilgrimage site.  Image caption Megha Mohan's grandmother as a younger woman  It is where my grandmother performed the final rites when my grandfather died 36 years ago. Rameswaram is famous for its historic temple, perched on the Bay of Bengal. Legend says that this was the place from where the Hindu god Rama built a bridge across the sea to Sri Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor. At various points during the three flights and the bumpy car journey, I'd read about the long ornate corridors, sacred towers and huge engraved stone pillars, and how people came to Rameswaram at significant moments. I hadn't considered myself religious but it occurred to me that I was now also a pilgrim. I'd thought a lot about Rameswaram and what the final chapter of saying goodbye would be like in the months following my grandmother's death.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption Rameswaram is one of India's most popular centres for Hindu pilgrimage  Back in my aunt's hotel room, holding her sanitary pad, having her tell me that I was now excluded from entering the the final part of our shared family mourning, I found myself on the defensive. \"You're saying I can't come to the temple because I'm on my period?\" I asked curtly. She narrowed her eyes swiftly enough for me to know that that tone hadn't been welcome in my youth, and most certainly wouldn't be tolerated in adulthood. \"I'm sorry,\" I conceded quickly. \"But surely that's not what you're saying. You're not saying that I've flown all the way here to not be able to go with you inside the temple.\" \"It's not what I'm saying,\" she said. \"That's just the way it is.\" \"Says who, though?\" I pressed. \"It is the way it is. It is a big deal.\" The sentence was stern, indicating to everyone else in the room that it would not be wise to speak up in my defence even if they wanted to. They didn't. The decision was made. I would be waiting with the driver outside the temple. * * *  Find out more   * **From Our Own Correspondent** has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world   * [Listen on iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlq), get [the podcast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fooc) or listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST  * * * Growing up I'd been given a pass from family outings to the temple when I was menstruating. The reasons why varied. One aunt had told me that it was tradition preserved from a time when women didn't have modern sanitary materials to absorb menstrual flow. My mother had told me that it was because it was the one time of the month where women were exempt from any duties, including household chores, a time when women could rest completely. Speaking to academics recently, I found contradictory statements on exactly why women were excluded. One pointed to the Hindu practice of Chaupadi, where menstruating women are considered impure and unlucky during her period. Yet a priest told me that women are at their purest during their cycle and hence would be tainted by being exposed to others, even at a temple. * * *  You may also like: [Banished for bleeding](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt- sh/banished_for_bleeding) [My dad jokes about my first period](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-41324799/my-dad-jokes-about-my- first-period) ['It's OK to make mayonnaise while on your period'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-41311476/it-s-ok-to-make- mayonnaise-while-on-your-period) * * * Dr Arvind Sharma, a professor of religion at McGill University in Montreal who specialises in the role of women in Hinduism, said the restriction has to do with concepts of ritual purity and impurity. \"There are certain times when human beings are considered ritually impure, as upon contact with a dead body, or excreta and so on. Women are considered so during periods,\" he says, \"It's hard to answer why as religious texts do not give reasons. \"The form of Hinduism we are talking about here is Smarta Hinduism, or the kind of Hinduism found in the Smritis (ancient Hindu texts). But in Shakta Hinduism (which is the body of Hinduism that celebrates the feminine, the Goddesses), menstruation is considered purifying rather than polluting.\"  Image copyrightVidya Nair Menstruation has been a hot topic in India in recent years, with activists running missions to provide sanitary napkins to rural women. Indian women have also challenged taboos attached to menstruation by staging social media campaigns using provocative hashtags like HappyToBleed. A recent Bollywood film Pad Man, which has been called the world's [first feature film on periods](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment- arts-42732782), explored the subject. The film is inspired by the life of [Arunachalam Muruganantham](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26260978), a Tamil Nadu- based social activist who campaigned to provide low-cost sanitary pad machines in rural parts of South India where few women have access to them. The lead actor Akshay Kumar said: \"I have lived with women all my life, yet I have learnt more about the topic while making this film than ever before. This is not the Stone Age - menstruating is natural.\" All this played on my mind as I waited outside the temple, watching my family head through the gates.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption The \"corridor of 1,000 pillars\" at Rameswaram  I reached for my phone to WhatsApp a female cousin, who couldn't make it to the final ritual. She sympathised with me, and then she paused typing for a few moments. \"You shouldn't have told them you were on your period,\" she wrote finally. \"They wouldn't have known.\" \"Have you been to the temple on your period?\" I asked. \"Most women our age have,\" she said casually, and contradicting my aunt's earlier statement just half an hour earlier, she added, \"It's not that big a deal if no-one knows.\"  _Follow Megha Mohan on Twitter_[@meghamohan](https://twitter.com/meghamohan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  _Join the conversation - find us on_[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCStories/) _,_[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bbcstories/) _,_[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgKRB26m6M3okTSP7C_UwA) _and_[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbcstories) _._   ,  Have you had a similar experience?

      "article": "[ At George Mason University, where I teach, I regularly have lunch with a group of economists that includes a libertarian provocateur with an impish sense of humor named Bryan Caplan. Whether you agree with him or not (I usually don 9t), Bryan makes you think hard about what you believe and what you think that you know. Now he 9s is out with a new jeremiad, cThe Case Against Education, in which he argues that Americans waste hundreds of billions of dollars a year on a higher-education system that teaches too little to too many. Citing copious amounts of social science data, Caplan calculates that at least half of the 67 percent premium earned by the average college graduate can be explained simply by the talent, knowledge and discipline that they already had when they arrived for freshman orientation. Much of the rest, he argues, is merely a signal to employers that college graduates are willing to put up with four years of (mostly) boring lectures and (mostly) tedious assignments in courses that (mostly) serve no purpose other than to test perseverance and willingness to conform to a prevailing culture. At most, he figures, only 20\\xa0percent of the college premium reflects any actual learning and skill development. For the typical student, he writes, a year in college cneither raises their productivity nor enriches their lives. If it is the coursework that makes college students more valuable workers, Caplan asks, then why don 9t more people skip the admissions process and the tuition and just sneak into large lecture courses to soak up that valuable knowledge free? If it is classroom learning that matters, why does the labor market offer almost no wage premium to those who have successfully completed one, two or even three years of college, while providing a sizable premium to those who have completed four? And why do tests taken before and after college reveal almost no retention of course material and little in the way of progress on generalized skills such as critical thinking and statistical analysis? New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) announces the Excelsior Scholarship on April 7, 2017, which covers tuition for any New Yorker accepted to one of the state 9s community colleges or four-year universities, provided their family earns less than $125,000 a year. (NYGovCuomo/YouTube) As Caplan sees it, our higher-education system is an effective but needlessly costly system for signaling employers about which workers to hire. The same goal, he suggests, could be accomplished with a smaller system that educates a much smaller number of talented and engaged students in practical subjects like science and engineering. Everyone else would be left to develop job skills at technical schools, in apprenticeships or on the job. Caplan calculates that while those who stick it out and earn a degree earn a good return on their personal investment, that doesn 9t apply to the half of poorly performing students who drop out. And as for public spending on higher education, he estimates rates of return ranging from paltry to negative, due to the high costs and dropout rates and the modest effect that additional higher education seems to have on economic output. If you find all this hard to swallow, you are not alone. There are plenty of reasons to think that Caplan has overreached in his gloomy conclusions. His book is full of clever but faulty logic and rhetorical straw men set up and easily knocked down. Many of his conclusions reflect the overconfidence of the social scientist who thinks everything that matters has been accurately measured in cthe data, and the narrow focus of the economist who confuses education and worker training. He ignores the value of sports and other non-classroom experiences that often reveal interests and hidden talents and help to shape character and ambition. He too easily dismisses the importance of exposing young people to new ideas and values and life possibilities, and recognizes no role for higher education in equalizing opportunity, creating a shared set of cultural values or having more informed voters. At times, Caplan tells us that labor markets are rational and efficient. At other times, not so much. Yet nowhere in the book is there evidence that he talked to real employers or real workers about how labor markets really work. And when confronted with the fact that people in every successful country seem to have made the same mistake of investing more of their new wealth on education, Caplan writes it off to csocial desirability bias, a kind of political correctness that causes people to refuse to accept unpleasant truths about themselves and others. What is unfortunate is that these flaws will make it easy for people 4 particularly those in higher education 4 to ignore the very real evidence Caplan presents that our system of higher education is not all it 9s cracked up to be. ![](https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/03/09/Others/Images/2018-03-07/GettyImages-682634468.jpg?uuid=j36OuCI6EeiUbJQgBgy3vQ) As long as graduates earn a 67 percent wage premium, universities will continue to focus on ways to enroll more students. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) For starters, you don 9t have to be an elitist to conclude that too many students are showing up at too many universities unprepared. That may be because high schools have failed to teach the knowledge or skills or study habits that they need, or that at 18 they are not emotionally mature enough for the challenge, or that they are simply bored by classroom learning. Whatever the reason, the right solution is to develop other pathways to career and life success. That may be as simple as encouraging students to take a few years off after high school to do something else, or creating a system of high-quality vocational and technical training, or relying more on internships and apprenticeships to determine career interests and develop basic skills. The idea that a traditional college education is right for everyone who reaches age 18, or that it is necessary for getting a good job or achieving success in life 4 that is simply wrong. As I regularly remind my Mason students, life rarely proceeds in a straight line. Caplan is also right that too many college courses are focused on transmitting specialized knowledge that we will never remember or use, and not enough on teaching students to analyze data, think logically and critically, come to reasonable conclusions and make a clear and cogent argument. There are also important social skills to be developed. These are the things that will be important long after students have forgotten what the War of the Roses was all about or the third law of thermodynamics. Some schools have begun to require teachers to fill out all sorts of forms identifying clearning outcomes and demonstrating how the course achieves them, but like so much in education, this has wound up being mostly a box-checking exercise. The reality is that while university provosts, deans and department chairmen give lip service to improving educational quality and accountability, they haven 9t done much about it. One reason is that today 9s students are surprisingly complacent and don 9t demand it. But the bigger reason is that professors resist it as a violation of their academic freedom and independence. Professors are hired and evaluated on the basis of their academic pedigree and research chops, not their ability to teach undergraduates. Once they are hired 4 and certainly once they get tenure 4 nobody reviews their syllabi, sits in on their classes or speaks to their students about their classroom experience. That 9s not to say there aren 9t many good and effective professors who take pride in their teaching and care about their students. But from an organizational perspective, the absence of quality control and the lack of focus on the experience 4 what is taught, how it is taught and how it can be improved 4 is a big problem. Caplan is also right to warn of the danger of an educational arms race. To attract more students and ensure that they graduate, too many universities have lowered standards and reduced their workload, making the college degree a less valuable signal to employers about who they are hiring. In turn, more students have come to believe they must earn a graduate degree to attract the attention of employers. One reason the returns on investment for higher education are not greater has to do with how big the investment has become. Despite all the hand-wringing about tuition increases and student debt, universities have never been serious about making the kind of deep structural changes that could lower costs and tuitions without sacrificing quality. There is serious money to be saved by trimming bureaucracies, making more extensive and creative use of teaching technology, altering schedules and calendars to make more efficient use of buildings and equipment and eliminating support for faculty research that is mediocre or lacks impact. The unfortunate reality, however, is that as long as their graduates earn a 67 percent wage premium, universities will continue to focus on ways to enroll more students rather than delivering better value to 4 and demanding more from 4 the students they already have. ] ",

The bill passed early on Tuesday and stipulates that two-thirds support is needed in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, before [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html) can relinquish control over any portion of the holy city to a foreign entity, according to local media.  The bill is widely seen as intended to make it more difficult to give up part of Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority, which wants the city's eastern half to be the capital of an independent Palestinian state.  The bill, backed by Israel's ruling right-wing coalition, was passed with 64 Knesset members voting in favour and 52 against, according to the Haaretz newspaper.  Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Oragnisation's executive committee, said the bill would \"destroy\" hopes for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\xa0  He went on to blame the US for the move, saying it was the outcome of a\\xa0[decision](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-transcript-full- jerusalem-israel-capital-171208093555029.html)\\xa0by President\\xa0[Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald- trump-161109050153947.html)\\xa0to recognise Jerusalem as the\\xa0[capital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-jerusalem- decision-latest-updates-171212081649751.html)\\xa0of Israel, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa.\\xa0  Trump also said he intended to move the country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

'Race law'  The legislation also seeks to remove Palestinian neighbourhoods from the jurisdiction of the current Jerusalem municipality, affecting two Palestinian areas - Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp - that are already on the other side of Israel's separation wall and are systematically neglected, the report noted.  Most Palestinians in Jerusalem hold permanent resident status, not Israeli citizenship, and their status can be revoked at any time for multiple reasons, forcing them to leave the city.  Israel has [revoked](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/08/israel-jerusalem- palestinians-stripped-status) nearly 15,000 Palestinian residency permits in Jerusalem since it took control of the city in 1967, Human Rights Watch estimates.  \"The new Jerusalem law is a race law; it's a law meant to cleanse Jerusalem of its Arab residents,\" Israeli legislator Esawi Freige said during the vote on the bill, according to Haaretz. \"After the Israeli government chose to erect a wall within Jerusalem, now it is seeking to remove 100,000 of its residents from the city.\"  Israel took control of the entirety of Jerusalem after its victory in the 1967 war. It later annexed East Jerusalem in a move that remains unrecognised by the international community.  Palestinian leaders seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, while Israel says the city cannot be divided. ] ",

      "article": "[ ONE of the biggest ideas to hit the political world in recent years is that politics is increasingly defined by the division between open and closed, rather than left and right. Openness means support for both economic openness (welcoming immigration and free trade) and the cultural sort (embracing ethnic and sexual minorities). Closedness means the opposite. This argument, which _The Economist_ explored in a cover article a couple of years ago, has recently been reinforced by the launch of a new think-tank, Global Future. Global Future marked its arrival with an opinion poll which suggests not only that the open-closed division is the most salient one in British politics, but that copen has time on its side. There is a 51-percentage-point difference between the under-45s and the over-45s on the question of whether immigration is a force for good, for example.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Donald Trump won by promising to put America first. But Bagehot is reluctant to give it the same force as the old distinction between left and right. The division is too self-serving for comfort. It looks more like ammunition for a political war than dispassionate analysis, and thereby contributes to the polarisation that it claims to diagnose. There are also too many facts that don 9t fit. Consider Brexit. Remainers regard it as the quintessential revolt against the open society. Yet some of the most prominent Leavers, such as Daniel Hannan and Douglas Carswell, are classical liberals who regard the European Union as a protectionist bloc that is bent on subsidising inefficient industries. It is true that the UK Independence Party thrived on fears of immigration. But at the height of its popularity it received only 4m votes, whereas 17m voted to leave. A poll of 12,000 Leavers found that their main motive, cited by 49%, was democratic self-government. By their own lights they were voting against a closed elite in favour of open and accountable government. The most obvious problem with the open-closed theory is that the divide is so slippery. Few people support entirely open societies 4it would be perverse to allow Ebola victims to cross borders unimpeded. By the same token, few people advocate becoming a hermit kingdom like North Korea. Nor are open and closed necessarily opposites. Having a strong border can make people more open, by giving them a sense that they can manage openness. Historically, most of the world 9s great centres of commerce have been walled cities. Constantinople, the crossroads between east and west, boasted not just a formidable wall but an outer and inner harbour. And different forms of openness and closedness don 9t always go together. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is open when it comes to transgender rights and immigration, but closed when it comes to foreign companies owning British utilities, or trade unions operating closed shops. Many Brexiteers are the opposite. The biggest problem with the open-closed divide, however, is that open people often aren 9t as open as they think 4indeed, they are open in so far as it serves their interests and no further. The young cosmopolitans celebrated by Global Future are closed when it comes to giving a fair hearing to social conservatives. Try opposing gay marriage in a college bar and you will discover the meaning of Herbert Marcuse 9s phrase crepressive tolerance d. This is even clearer in economics, where open people cluster in industries that have been less affected by globalisation than manufacturing. Steelworkers have been upended by competition from China. Public-sector bureaucrats have not been touched. Supposedly open people have also protected themselves from competition by constructing a wall of licences, restrictions and other barriers to entry. The post-1979 deregulation of the economy was one-sided. Working-class closed shops, such as that of the printworkers, were broken, while professional closed shops, notably for barristers, were left to thrive. Academics like to think of themselves as open to their core. But academia is rife with restrictive practices. The most highly prized commodity in academic life is tenure 4that is, the right to an income for life whatever happens to the world. University towns have some of the strictest planning laws around, so that insiders see the value of their most important asset soar. Academic publishers make their profits by rolling several sorts of rent- seeking together. They get free content because academics have to publish to get tenure, and a guaranteed market because academic libraries have to buy their books and journals. Bankers have similar double standards. Critics rightly point out that they are arch-globalists when the market is on the up, but then turn to national governments when it crashes. But the problem runs deeper. Like other industries, finance is rigged from the inside by firms that invest in lobbyists and hire ex-politicians who still wield influence. The real divide There is a better explanation of political polarisation than the open-closed split. It is the gap between exam-passers and exam-flunkers. Qualifications grant access to a world that is protected from the downside of globalisation. You can get a job with a superstar company that has constructed moats and drawbridges to protect itself, or with a middle-class guild that provides job security, or with the state bureaucracy. Failing exams casts you down into an unpredictable world of cut-throat competition. Exam-passers combine a common ability to manage the downside of globalisation with a common outlook 4call it narcissistic cosmopolitanism 4that binds them together and legitimises their disdain for rival tribes. Exam- flunkers, meanwhile, are united by anger at the elitists who claim to be open as long as their jobs are protected. They are increasingly willing to bring the system crashing down. Talking about open v closed is a double error. It obscures the deeper forces dividing the world, and spares winners by playing down the legitimate concerns of losers.

      "article": "[ KABUL, Afghanistan 4 With three children under the age of five and a husband who could neither read nor write, 25-year-old Jahantap Ahmadi dreamed of going to college. Her high school degree was enough to become a teacher at the only elementary school in her village in central Afghanistan __ in an open field 4 but she wanted more. On March 15, cheered on by her husband, Jahantap set out for the Daikundi provincial capital of Nili to take the university entrance exam. She walked until her feet were blistered and bruised and then sat for 10 hours with her infant daughter, Khezran, cradled on her lap in a rickety bus over rugged rocky roads. Once in Nili, she took the exam and scored a respectable 152 out of a possible 200. But it was a picture of Jahantap posted on Facebook, sitting cross-legged on the classroom floor, her 2-month-old baby asleep on her lap as she took the exam, that made the dream of going to college come true. A teacher in Nili who was moved by Jahantap 9s determination to get an education posted pictures on Facebook. In Afghanistan, where women still struggle for even the most basic of rights, it went viral.  cMy brother who was working in Kabul called me and said 8I saw your picture in Facebook, 9 she said in an interview in Kabul where she is now enrolled at a private university. cI wanted to get my education, so I could help my village, change my village. I want to help my society. But first I wanted it for my children, so one day they could be educated. Nearly 17 years after the overthrow of the Taliban government, which outlawed women 9s education, an estimated 6 million children are in school in Afghanistan and a third of them are girls. However, most girls don 9t study beyond elementary school, and of the 3.5 million Afghan children who have never gone to school, 75 percent are girls, according to the 2017 annual report of the United Nations Children 9s Fund, which was released in February. Zahra Yagana, who runs a small non-governmental organization that provides awareness of the environment and the value of education, said the picture of Jahantap on the floor, while other students sat at desks, inspired her to get Jahantap to Kabul and into a university.  cLife is still very difficult for women in Afghanistan. We need the international community to stay for 50 or 100 years to change things here for women, said Yagana.  cWhen I saw the picture of Jahantap on Facebook, I was so impressed, she said. cRight away the next day I wrote a story about her, but I thought we have to do something for her, help her get her education. She inspired me. Yagana went to the government and recruited Farkhunda Zahra Naderi, a senior adviser to President Ashraf Ghani, as well as Sarwar Danish, a vice president. Naderi is paying Jahantap 9s university tuition and Danish will pay the rent on the family 9s home in Kabul.  cThey said she is a symbol for women and education, said Yagana. In a country that remains deeply conservative and patriarchal, Jahantap 9s husband, Musa Mohammadi, would seem an anomaly.  cI am so proud of my wife, said Mohammadi, who never attended school and is illiterate.  cThat 9s not the life I want for my children, he said. cI see a sign on the road and I can 9t read it. I go to the pharmacy to get medicine, but I can 9t read the name of the pills. That 9s not right. It is very difficult for me. Before taking her entrance exams in March, Mohammadi said his wife taught children in the open field beneath the blistering summer sun. cI saw how many people wanted education. They all brought their children for her to teach. His uncle, Mohammad Reza Hesani, said when Jahantap married Mohammadi she bought pens and books for the children in her new husband 9s family, most of whom had never been to school.  cJahantap has given light to the women in our village, said Hesani. cWe respect her. My wife is so interested now in going to school after she saw Jahantap. Still, there 9s a lingering fear that any peace deal with the Taliban would set back the fragile gains made over the last 17 years. Already, women 9s rights groups have assailed Ghani 9s government for failing to pass legislation to protect women and allowing clerics to rail against rights for women, stalling the little progress made thus far. Masuda Karokhi, a member of parliament, told The Associated Press she is ctired and disappointed that each time legislators press for laws to advance the rights of women, including a law to eliminate violence against women, conservative members intervene to delay it. She said the government panders to those members at the expense of women 9s rights. A 2017 Human Rights Watch report on Afghanistan said attempts to reform family law, including divorce provisions, have stalled. At a conference on violence against women, Karokhi said one conservative member of parliament argued that Islamic law allowed for violence against women.  cWhy is it that if a woman laughs, these conservative men say there is something in Shariah (Islamic law) that says it is wrong, but men can do anything and there is nothing in Shariah against them, Karokhi said. cIt 9s so disappointing and frustrating, the attitudes of men in Afghanistan. ____ Associated Press writer Amir Shah contributed to this report.

      "article": "[  **Rabat, Morocco -** Overcrowding, the lack of an efficient strategy and poor administration are harming public schools in [Morocco](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/morocco.html)\\xa0and diminishing the opportunities available to underprivileged children, experts, teachers and students have told Al Jazeera.  The crisis in the education sector comes despite repeated efforts by successive governments to reform the archaic system.  Meanwhile, social disparity is widening with the growth of private schools as higher-income families increasingly opt to pay for better services, threatening those who rely on free and quality education.  Despite high tuition costs, the number of those shifting from public to private schools soared from 4 percent in 1999 to 15 percent in 2015.  A World Economic Forum report in 2015 placed Morocco at 101 out of 140 countries in a quality of education index.  According to a 2014 Unesco report, Morocco was ranked among the 21 worst countries in the field of education, with more than half of students in public schools failing to acquire necessary reading and maths skills.  > It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career.\\r > > Anas Mrabti, high school student > >   Morocco's King Mohammed VI has highlighted the dire situation on several occasions.  \"The education system faces many difficulties and problems especially due to adopting some programmes and educational curricula, which do not suit the requirements of the labour market,\" King Mohammed said in a speech on August 20, 2013.  \"The current situation in the education and training sectors requires an assessment process that measures achievements and identifies the weaknesses and imbalances,\" he added.  Anas Mrabti, a high school student at a public school in Rabat, expressed concern over the future of underprivileged pupils.  \"It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"The majority of students at public schools come from poor families, who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools. The dilemma is that there is a big gap between the public and private schools in terms of quality education and services.\"  He added that financial disparities could affect higher education.  \"Students from public schools find it very difficult to compete with students from private schools to access reputable institutions and universities. Parents normally send their kids to private schools because they know that those schools can earn their kids higher marks,\" he said.  Because privately-educated children usually attain better grades, it becomes \"very difficult for students from public schools to \\u2026 access major universities and institutions,\" said the student.\\xa0   'Students not equipped'   ****In recent years, successive governments have tried to implement structural adjustments to increase access to education and improve the education system's performance, the latest of which is the Council of Education's \"Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School\".  This strategy was first implemented in 2015 and is expected to continue until 2030.\\xa0  But so far, there have been few solutions.  According to Mohammed, a headmaster of a public school in Tetouan who declined to give his last name, \"the educational field has been suffering for a while from the gap between theory and practice, and of the gap between ideas and application\".  He told Al Jazeera: \"Students are not equipped with the practical skills they need to integrate them into the job market.  \"Our public schools are like buildings lacking pillars that keep them standing. Any major reform bid needs to transform goals into practical solutions.\"  An academic researcher, who preferred not to give his name, agreed that the Ministry of Education's previous and current attempts at reform were superficial.  \"All reform attempts were inspired by Western models that do not take into consideration the possibility of application, and whether the country is ready to apply such reforms on ground.  \"The country has its own identity and characteristics. The setup of any effective reform plan can only be achieved through a participatory approach that should include academics, educational syndicates, researchers and trainers.  \"Securing logistics and funding are not enough to ensure good educational quality. Public schools used to enjoy a good reputation in the past, and the authorities in this country should restore that dignity by finding solutions for such a vital sector.\"  Mohamed Jouji, a retired father who has two daughters in private schools, said Morocco is far from achieving its goals in the public education sector.  \"The issues are mainly school dropouts, weak numbers of schooling in the rural world, the high illiteracy rate, and the deterioration of educational performance,\" Jouji told Al Jazeera.   The end of free education?   ****Another headache added to the Moroccan burden is a new draft bill introduced by the government, which aims at putting an end to free education in the kingdom.  The bill proposes that preschool, primary and secondary education should remain free of charge for all Moroccans, but suggests registration fees for high schools and universities for middle and high-income families.  The draft law has angered parents and education syndicates, who consider the move a violation of Moroccan citizens' right to free education. ] ",

Lesley Stahl: They want gun control. Betsy DeVos: They want a variety of things. They want solutions. Lesley Stahl: Do you think that teachers should have guns in the classroom? Betsy DeVos: That should be an option for states and communities to consider. And I hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way. But for those who are-- who are capable, this is one solution that can and should be considered. But no one size fits all. Every state and every community is going to address this issue in a different way. ![0311-60mins-betsy5.jpg ](https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/11/d9f5e3f7-c2db- 43e3-9384-54537b302035/resize/770x/8d88f19e8afe1844348f97c86d9eb123/0311 -60mins-betsy5.jpg)  _Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos speaks with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl_  CBS News Lesley Stahl: Do you see yourself as a leader in this-- in this subject? And what kind of ideas will you be promoting? Betsy DeVos: I have actually asked to head up a task force that will really look at what states are doing. \\xa0See there are a lot of states that are addressing these issues in very cohesive and coherent ways. Lesley Stahl: Do you feel a sense of urgency? Betsy DeVos: Yes. Lesley Stahl: 'Cause this sounds like talking. Instead of acting. Betsy DeVos: No, there is a sense of urgency indeed.  \"I hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.\" The reason Betsy DeVos wanted to be secretary of education was so she could promote school choice, offering parents options other than traditional public schools 3 where 90 percent of kids go. She has proposed massive cuts in public education funding and wants to shift billions to alternative players like private, parochial and charter schools. Betsy DeVos: We have invested billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal level And we have seen zero results. Lesley Stahl: But that really isn't true. Test scores have gone up over the last 25 years. So why do you keep saying nothing's been accomplished? Betsy DeVos: Well actually, test scores vis-\\xe0-vis the rest of the world have not gone up. And we have continued to be middle of the pack at best. That's just not acceptable. Lesley Stahl: No it's not acceptable. But it's better than it was. That's the point. You don't acknowledge that things have gotten better. You won't acknowledge that, over the-- Betsy DeVos: But I don't think they have for too many kids. We've stagnated Lesley Stahl: Okay, so there's the big argument. So what can be done about that? Betsy DeVos: What can be done about that is empowering parents to make the choices for their kids. Any family that has the economic means and the power to make choices is doing so for their children. Families that don't have the power, that can't decide: \"I'm gonna move from this apartment in downtown whatever to the suburb where I think the school is gonna be better for my child\" if they don't have that choice 3 and they are assigned to that school, they are stuck there. I am fighting for the parents who don't have those choices. We need all parents to have those choices.\\xa0  \"We should be funding and investing in students, not in school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems.\" Question is: does her solution work? Do choice schools perform better than public schools? Naturally -- there are conflicting studies. It's complicated. But DeVos spends a lot of time showcasing choice schools like Cold Spring Elementary, a public school in Indianapolis 3 that was allowed to get rid of the local teachers' union and create an innovative curriculum. But when parents choose these options, taxpayer funds follow the child and that means that the public school left behind can end up with less money. Lesley Stahl: Why take away money from that school that's not working, to bring them up to a level where they are-- that school is working? Betsy DeVos: Well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school-- school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. Lesley Stahl: Okay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that's not working? What about those kids? Betsy DeVos: Well, in places where there have been-- where there is-- a lot of choice that's been introduced-- Florida, for example, the-- studies show that when there's a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually-- the results get better, as well. ![0311-60mins-betsy2.jpg ](https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/11/a2a5f0cd-f379-4ca0-bbd5-e70a6dc01908/resize/770x/243981d29ef1d3c319504203e025e205/0311 -60mins-betsy2.jpg) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos works with students at Cold Spring School in Indianapolis  CBS News Lesley Stahl: Now, has that happened in Michigan? We're in Michigan. This is your home state. Betsy DeVos: Michi--Yes, well, there's lots of great options and choices for students here. Lesley Stahl: Have the public schools in Michigan gotten better? Betsy DeVos: I don't know. Overall, I-- I can't say overall that they have all gotten better. Lesley Stahl: The whole state is not doing well. Betsy DeVos: Well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this-- the students are doing well and-- Lesley Stahl: No, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in Michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. Betsy DeVos: I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Lesley Stahl: The public schools here are doing worse than they did. Betsy DeVos: Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. Lesley Stahl: Have you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they're doing? Betsy DeVos: I have not-- I have not-- I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. Lesley Stahl: Maybe you should. Betsy DeVos: Maybe I should. Yes. DeVos is the only Cabinet secretary protected by a squad of U.S. Marshals because she's gotten death threats. She's frequently met by protesters who accuse her of pushing an elitist agenda. She often manages to offend, as when she called historically black colleges and universities \"pioneers\" of \"school choice\" 3 as though they had a choice. At this commencement speech at Bethune-Cookman University, students booed and turned their backs to her. Lesley Stahl: Why have you become, people say, the most hated Cabinet secretary? \\xa0 Betsy DeVos: I'm not so sure exactly how that happened. But I think there are a lot of really powerful forces allied against change. Lesley Stahl: Does it hurt? Betsy DeVos: Sometimes it does. Sometimes it does. Again, I think-- I think-- Lesley Stahl: Do you ever say-- Betsy DeVos: \\xa0--I'm more misunderstood than anything. ![0311-60mins-betsy4.jpg ](https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/11/44c35690-d5b0-40ec- b9d7-dce9b8d8edb8/resize/770x/fcc44d4b9f76db1d5a18243254d16e1e/0311-60mins- betsy4.jpg) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos  CBS News Some of the criticism, she feels, is unfair, especially when it involves her wealth. She faced a hostile question about it during a speech at Harvard last year. Harvard Question: So you're a billionaire with lots and lots of investments. And the so-called school choice movement is a way to open the floodgates for corporate interests to make money off the backs of students. How much do you expect your net worth to increase as a result of your policy choices? Moderator: You can choose not to answer that secretary. Among President Trump's cabinet of moguls and titans, DeVos is the richest: she grew up wealthy and married even wealthier. In their hometown of Grand Rapids, the DeVoses have been exceedingly charitable, their name decorates buildings like the civic center and children's hospital. At her bruising confirmation hearing, she was grilled about her wealth and lack of experience. She's been an advocate, not an educator. \\xa0\\xa0 Lesley Stahl: What happened there? Betsy DeVos: I've not had a root canal, but I can imagine that a root canal might be more pleasant than that was. Lesley Stahl: So you've been on the job now over a year. What have you done that you're most proud of? Betsy DeVos: Yeah. We've begun looking at and rolling back a lot of the overreach of the federal government in education. By overreach she means regulations. And like most of President Trump's cabinet, DeVos is a devoted de-regulator. Part of her job as Secretary of Education is overseeing guidelines that protect the civil rights of students. Just days after being confirmed, she rescinded a guideline implemented under President Obama that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice 3 sparking even more protests. She is now considering scrapping the Obama-era \"guidance on how to identify, avoid and remedy discriminatory discipline,\" which aims to prevent schools from punishing students of color more harshly than their white classmates. Betsy DeVos: We are studying that rule. We need to ensure that all students have an opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. And all students means all students. Lesley Stahl: Yeah but let's say there's a disruption in the classroom and a bunch of whites kids are disruptive and they get punished, you know, go see the principal, but the black kids are, you know, they call in the cops. I mean, that's the issue: who and how the kids who disrupt are being punished. Betsy DeVos: Arguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids. And-- Lesley Stahl: Well, no. That-- it's not. Betsy DeVos: --it does come down to individual kids. And--often comes down to-- I am committed to making sure that students have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is conducive to their learning. Lesley Stahl: Do you see this disproportion in discipline for the same infraction as institutional racism? Betsy DeVos: We're studying it carefully. And are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments. While this regulation is under review, she has already drawn fire for changing Title IX guidelines on handling sexual assault on college campuses. She's allowing colleges to require stronger evidence from accusers, and give the accused a greater benefit of the doubt. Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way, do you think, suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes or assaults? Betsy DeVos: Well, one sexual assault is one too many, and one falsely accused individual is one too many. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but are they the same? Betsy DeVos: I don't know. I don't know. But I'm committed to a process that's fair for everyone involved. Lesley Stahl: The Me-Too Movement has come along at the same time. This is all feeding into it. We're not talking about colleges anymore. We're talking about men in positions of power in industry and government. Have you ever had an issue? Betsy DeVos: I can recall a number of moments in the past-- several decades ago that I think today would just be viewed as unacceptable. Yeah. It's been an unlikely journey and balancing act for grandmother Betsy DeVos, from her sheltered life in Michigan 3 to her life now as a lightning rod in Washington.  _Produced by Shachar Bar-On.

In a speech at a meeting in Washington of state school chiefs from across the country, she also accused them of failing to use enough imagination in implementing the K-12 federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act, and said she was delivering a dose of ctough love. She said: > ESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs 4 including many in this room 4 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state 9s unique challenges. Well, this law gives you that chance. > > The trouble is . . . I don 9t see much evidence that you 9ve yet seized it. Without mentioning specifics, DeVos blamed the graduation scandal on the Obama administration for dictating education policy rather than allowing states to make their own choices, as has been traditional. In her speech to the Council of Chief State School Officers, she said: > We also should be able to clearly gauge the progress of all our nation 9s students. That, too, hasn 9t been a simple task over the years. Previous efforts focused on a goal 4 such as higher graduation rates 4 and if you didn 9t meet it, you 9d face the ire of cBig Ed. > > While that goal might have been laudable, we 9ve seen what happens. Just look at the ongoing scandal right here in our nation 9s capital, where school administrators fudged the rules and graduated kids who otherwise wouldn 9t have been eligible 4 all in response to top-down pressure. _[[ There 9s good and bad news for Betsy DeVos on her anniversary as U.S. education secretary ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2018/02/07/theres-good-and-bad-news-for-betsy-devos-on-her-first- anniversary-as-u-s-education-secretary/?utm_term=.562ed021c825)]_ DeVos referenced the D.C. scandal in which it was discovered that one in three high school seniors were awarded diplomas last year even though they did not meet the requirements. The graduation rate for the city 9s high schools was 73 percent in 2017, but data released last week showed that only 42 percent of seniors at traditional D.C. public schools are on track to graduate, with 19 percent cmoderately off-track. The city report, ordered by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser after media reports alleged graduation fraud at Ballou High School, said that educators in the D.C. school system had long felt pressure to raise graduation rates. In her speech, DeVos linked such pressure to what she called cmicromanagement from Washington. _[[ D.C. mayor called her ousted school chancellor 9s action 8indefensible. 9 He says she knew about it for months. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/dc-mayor-muriel-bowser- called-her-ousted-school-chancellors-action-indefensible-the-chancellor-says- bowser-knew-about-it-for-months/2018/03/05/d909cbc3-6e34-49f8-995f- 22e1dd2ea5aa_story.html?utm_term=.7da45e4b9df3)]_ Barack Obama 9s education secretary, Arne Duncan, exercised unprecedented federal power in pushing states to implement school reform policies\\xa0the administration favored. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who heads the Senate Education Committee, derisively called Duncan 9s department ca national school board. And Congress rewrote the K-12 federal education law, then known as No Child Left Behind, to return much of the power to the states. DeVos has made clear since she took office in February 2017 that she is no fan of the federal government (she once said cgovernment sucks d) and doesn 9t believe there should be a federal Education Department. She has also advanced a new definition of caccountability for schools, saying that she is not focused on the Obama-era metrics of standardized test scores but rather on how fast states and districts create alternatives to traditional public schools for children. Here is the full text of her March 5 speech, as prepared for delivery, provided by the Education Department: > Thank you, Carey, for that kind introduction. I want to thank each of the chiefs, and your teams, for everything you do to ensure the students you serve are well-prepared for successful careers and fulfilling lives. And I also want to thank you for your partnership over the past year. > > Our relationship will become even more important following the tragedy in Parkland, Florida. No student, no parent, no teacher should ever have to experience what many did at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Pam, we 9ve already worked closely in the wake of this tragedy and I appreciate your dedication and strength. > > We must have an open and honest conversation about what went wrong, and what we must do now to ensure our children are safe at school. I look forward to hearing your ideas and working with you. > > I know we may sometimes differ on what policy levers to pull, as there is no one-size-fits all approach for every state, or for every community. And there will be varying solutions. I hope we can always stay focused on individual students. > > That must be our aim every day, in everything we do. Accordingly, it must be at the core of implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act. > > When this bipartisan bill was written, passed and signed, it signaled a shift in America 9s approach to education policy. Unlike prior efforts, ESSA was born of a recognition that federal overreach had failed. Recall that when the U.S. Department of Education was established, it was charged by Congress to cprohibit federal control of education. > > That 9s a charge I embrace. And it 9s one I directed my team to take seriously as we continue to review your plans to ensure they comply with the law. Every plan that I sign is a commitment to that, and only that 4 the plan meets the requirements of the law. > > I didn 9t write the law. It 9s not a perfect law. But it 9s the law. > > I have refrained from expressing my opinion, thus far, out of respect for the process. But since we 9re all in this room together now, I couldn 9t pass up the opportunity to share some candid thoughts. Around my house, we call it ctough love. > > For too long, many of you have operated 4 and in many cases, been forced to operate 4 as if your work was only accountable to folks in my office. As if all that mattered in education was a sign-off from Washington. Or, perhaps worse yet, fear of what would happen if an aptly-described cbrutalist building in southwest D.C. didn 9t like your ideas. > > My predecessors, from both parties, often fell into the trap of a top-down approach, too often ignoring those who walk side-by-side with students every day. > > That 9s not to say I question their motives. Education is a unique issue in public life \\u2026 everyone agrees on the desired outcome. Everyone wants students to be prepared for successful careers and fulfilling lives. And the truth is: we need that to be the case. > > Except too many folks believe they should pursue that good end by centralizing federal power and wielding it aggressively. > > As a result, you were threatened with inquiries, audits and even fines if you didn 9t comply with the politics of the day in this town. > > I 9m committed to a different approach. > > We won 9t weaponize waivers to compel you to adopt this administration 9s politics. If we wanted to dictate from D.C., I 9d claim the mantle of our nation 9s cchoice chief and reject plans because they don 9t give parents more quality choices. But I haven 9t done that. And I won 9t. The department is not the national school board. > > This administration is committed to our nation 9s founding idea of separation of powers. The Department of Education doesn 9t write laws, it implements them. Congress did its job. We 9re doing ours. And now, you get to do yours. > > ESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs 4 including many in this room 4 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state 9s unique challenges. Well, this law gives you that chance. > > The trouble is \\u2026 I don 9t see much evidence that you 9ve yet seized it. > > At least not in the ESSA plans I 9ve thus far approved. Some have said that they didn 9t write their plans cto win an ESSA competition. Other plans look as though they were just written to get good grades from D.C. interest groups. Still other plans seem like they were written only for one purpose: compliance. > > Let me be clear: just because a plan complies with the law doesn 9t mean it does what 9s best for students. > > Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won 9t pass muster around kitchen tables. And I 9m not alone in this view. > > Some of your own governors 4 Republicans and Democrats 4 didn 9t like your plans either and refused to sign off on them. Some were vocal about it. > > One was disappointed his state 9s plan did cnot take full advantage of the opportunities for flexibility and innovation. > > Another warned his state 9s superintendent that cadding layers of bureaucratic paperwork does little to help low-performing schools. Still another governor lamented that his state 9s plan cstymies any attempt to hold schools accountable for student performance and includes provisions aimed at preserving the status quo in failing schools. > > And by the way, I agree. > > But what do these perspectives say to teachers in your state? What do they say to parents? What do these sentiments say to students? > > ESSA invites a different approach. > > Let 9s start with ESSA 9s cAnnual State Report Cards, one of the law 9s calls for transparency. Parents need to know 4 and have the right to know 4 what is and is not working about their children 9s schools. > > Some parents want to be equipped to make a different choice for their child, and others want to know where their child 9s current school needs to get better. > > Parents need information that is accessible, relevant and actionable. But too many parents who read their state 9s plan would have every right to think much is obfuscated \\u2026. as if their state doesn 9t want anyone to know how their students are really doing. > > Some states proposed accountability schemes that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one. Another state took a simple concept like a color-coded dashboard and managed to make it nearly indecipherable. > > We must do better for parents. For students. For our country. Louisiana, for example, uses an understandable A through F grading system with some pretty clear consequences for cF schools, including making other options available to parents whose children are assigned to those schools. > > We also should be able to clearly gauge the progress of all our nation 9s students. That, too, hasn 9t been a simple task over the years. Previous efforts focused on a goal 4 such as higher graduation rates 4 and if you didn 9t meet it, you 9d face the ire of cBig Ed. > > While that goal might have been laudable, we 9ve seen what happens. Just look at the ongoing scandal right here in our nation 9s capital, where school administrators fudged the rules and graduated kids who otherwise wouldn 9t have been eligible 4 all in response to top-down pressure. > > Under ESSA, states must measure students annually in reading and math, but the law invites you to determine the standards, determine the instruments and find solutions for the rest. > > Parents and teachers alike agree that education should move away from simply cteaching to the test. We all know we need new solutions. > > I 9ve heard many complaints about how inadequate current testing regimens are, but only four states have shown interest in applying for ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment Pilot 4 inspired by New Hampshire 9s performance-based assessment. > > The Granite State reduced standardized testing and enhanced locally- developed common performance assessments. They were designed to support deeper learning and to be more integrated into students 9 day-to-day work. > > Assessing the average assesses no one. Because there is no average student. > > New Hampshire 9s is but one new approach, but there are many other approaches that have yielded promising results for students. So, explore them! > > Title I, as you all know, was established to assist students who come from low-income families. These students need your creative thinking, but too many plans are short on creative solutions. > > cDirect Student Services is one vehicle you can use to better serve these students. You have the option to set aside up to three percent of Title I funds to provide students with learning opportunities that would otherwise not be available. We actually asked Congress to raise that to 5 percent in our 2019 budget proposal. > > But to date, only two states 4 New Mexico and Louisiana 4 have sought that flexibility. > > Louisiana will use its 3 percent 4 nearly 9 million dollars 4 to expand its course choice program, offering new options to students. I 9m encouraged that Louisiana is doing something, but ESSA encourages all states to use Title I funds creatively. Because today too many students are told cno. > > A student is bored in her math class and would be more challenged in an AP course? cSorry, we don 9t have AP here, the system says. > > A student wants to learn a skill like welding because she wants to work for the advanced manufacturer in town? cNope, the system tells the student, cwe don 9t have that available either. > > I 9m not comfortable with settling for those answers. I hope you aren 9t either. > > Course choice is but one way a state can embrace the law 9s flexibility in the interest of students. States could also use their 3 percent to incentivize enrollment in public schools of choice. > > ESSA also enables you to take an additional 7 percent of Title I funds and use them to empower local educators and districts to experiment with new approaches. For example in Nevada, 30 Clark County schools work together in what the state calls a cPartnership Network. The network teams with local leaders who have fresh perspectives. > > Nevada boasts this is not a cset it and forget it approach. Instead, they are constantly evaluating to ensure the funds are spent in the most productive way. > > Responsible use of taxpayer funds is important. That 9s why the law requires the public disclosure of how resources flow down to the school level. States like Georgia, Rhode Island and Colorado have already been doing so for years. And I applaud them for that. Next year, all states will need to show hard-working families how their money is being spent. > > But I 9d encourage you to go even further. Why not show how much money is being spent on each student and why? Is that different from the school down the street? And if so, why? > > The student-centered funding pilot takes us in that direction. This competitive grant enables money to follow children based on their needs 4 not buildings or systems. > > So as I 9ve pointed out, there are some bright spots among the plans. But even the best plan is short on the meaningful solutions that the law encourages. Even the best plan doesn 9t take full advantage of the law 9s built-in flexibility. > > And launching a PR push to defend these plans doesn 9t change that. It misses the point. > > Because our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. Or the cNCLB approach. Or the cRTTT approach. The cWashington knows best approach. > > So, don 9t you think it 9s time to do something different? To try something new that enhances student achievement? > > ESSA doesn 9t stand in your way. Our department won 9t stand in your way either. States are better equipped to find answers to their unique questions than Washington is. But states should always look for ways to\\xa0pass down flexibility and empower teachers and parents 4 those closest to students. > > Even though I 9ve not yet had the opportunity to approve California 9s plan, its governor was spot on when he said: cThis is not going to be solved in Sacramento. Kids learn at home and in the classroom \\u2026 People who really want to help in a school that is not performing should go to the principal and find out what they need. Local empowerment. That 9s what it 9s all about. The age of micromanagement from Washington or Sacramento is over as far as I am concerned. > > Governor Brown is right! > > Because the imperative to do something shouldn 9t have to come from Washington. It shouldn 9t have to come from your state capital. The imperative to do better comes from students. We are accountable to them! > > Better to try something new than to just hope for a better result. > > Because hope alone is not a strategy. Students don 9t have time to wait while adults hope plans will work. > > That 9s why your ESSA plans aren 9t a ceiling. There is no ceiling. There is no ceiling on what students can achieve. These plans merely establish the floor! > > ESSA plans are just words on a page. Let me put it this way: We don 9t evaluate football teams solely on who has the better game plan on paper. We evaluate them by what happens on the field! > > The real work of ESSA lies ahead. > > Because there is much work to be done. We must all do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st century and beyond. > > Students need learning environments that are agile, relevant and exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced and challenging lifelong learning journey. > > But when you picture most of today 9s classrooms, does the word cagile leap to mind? What about ccustomized d? cRelevant d? > > That 9s why we must pursue a paradigm shift \\u2026 a fundamental reorientation \\u2026 a rethink. > > I 9ve called for this nation to rethink school, and I want to make sure you 9re clear what I mean. > > cRethink means we question everything to ensure nothing limits a student from pursuing his or her passion, and achieving his or her potential. So each student is prepared at every turn for what comes next. > > Question everything. At every school. In support of every student 9s success. > > So I ask each of you: What are you going to do to rethink education in your state? > > What are you going to do to serve students in your state? Students! Not graduation rates, not a lobbyist 9s latest ranking, not a lawmaker 9s pet project \\u2026 no. > > These are our children we 9re talking about. These are their futures \\u2026 and ours. > > Right now a student is being bullied somewhere for only wanting to read, pay attention to the teacher and learn. Right now a student is being told he can 9t study a topic for his dream job because the school building doesn 9t have the teacher or the technology. Right now a student at school is stepping over rats, breathing in mold and dodging fists. These could be any of your students. All they want to do is learn. All their parents want is something better. > > And what will you say? What do your plans say? What will you do? > > Will you look into those students 9 eyes and settle for only what 9s required, nothing more? Will you sit across from that student stepping over rats and say, cBut our ESSA plan complied with the law! > > That child doesn 9t care about an ESSA plan. That student 9s parents don 9t care about my signature on your piece of paper. They care about what you do. > > We can act now. We must act now. > > Students 9 dreams, their hopes, their aspirations, their futures don 9t wait \\u2026 and neither can we. > > Our health, our economy, our continued security as a nation depends on what we do today for the leaders of tomorrow. > > We can do this.

      "article": "[ This dream is possible, but right now a lot of barriers stand in the way. We have a patchwork of state and local sex education policies and programs that vary widely across the country -- some leaning on abstinence-only instruction, reinforcing Weinstein-esque (or worse) [gender norms](https://thinkprogress.org/this-is-how-we-are-spending-billions-on-the- sexual-mis-education-of-americas-youth-19a18439ce8f/), and lies about the efficacy of birth control. Too many young people are forced to resort to internet searches and rely on rumors for supposed information about sex and sexuality. What they end up finding can be dangerous and misleading. In this moment of reckoning about sexual assault and harassment, young people crave accurate information and want it on their own terms. An animated video created by a program I work with, [AMAZE](https://amaze.org/) \\-- titled \"[What is Sexual Assault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8gslq85Xsc)?\" -- had its views spike above 100,000 after MeToo took hold in the media. There are some terrific resources out there to help parents, teachers and teens fill in the gaps, but they need additional resources to cut through a saturated media landscape. ![The past, present and future of birth control in America](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) ![The past, present and future of birth control in America](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170915112147-this-is-sex-with-lisa- ling-control-large-169.jpg) ![The past, present and future of birth control in America](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170915112147-this-is-sex-with-lisa- ling-control-large-169.jpg)[](javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  The past, present and future of birth control in America Replay [More Videos ...](/videos)  MUST WATCH The past, present and future of birth control in America 15:44 Sex education that covers not just the birds and the bees but also teaches skills for establishing boundaries, consent and healthy relationships is key to dismantling a culture that allows sexual harassment and assault to persist throughout every industry, street and school in America. This isn't a pipe dream; it's becoming the reality in places[ like California](http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/readers- opinion/article183044641.html), where the recently enacted Healthy Youth Act requires comprehensive sex education in schools across the state, complete with factual and inclusive information about sex, consent, and healthy relationships. Unfortunately, this is not the sex education most of our children receive. Far too many students face abstinence-only curricula that shame anything other than strict heterosexuality and gender conformity. [Studies show](http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\\(17\\)30260-4/fulltext) that abstinence-only programs don't delay sexual activity, but do give young people false and dangerous perceptions about sexual health and relationships. Just last year, an abstinence-only program was banned from a New York district after it compared a girl's [virginity to chewing gum](http://www.syracuse.com/schools/index.ssf/2017/12/cny_parent_frustrated_with_sex_ed_lesson_that_compares_losing_virginity_to_chewe.html) and asked boys if they would want used gum. This common tactic used in abstinence-only programs spreads fear and stigma and fuels a harassment culture by promoting gender relations that devalue women and police their sexual activity. Now they're resurging under the Trump administration, which hired a crusader for [rebranding](https://www.salon.com/2017/06/12/abstinence-only-rebranded- failed-right-wing-sex-ed-policy-returns-as-sexual-risk-avoidance/) abstinence- only with a euphemism: \"[sexual risk avoidance](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/06/23/euphemism-sexual-risk- avoidance/cowYjFTOcIS7hmD0wtm64O/story.html).\" But make no mistake; these are the same old ineffective programs masquerading under a benign name. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on [Twitter ](http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) While it may seem impossible to gain support at the federal level for high- quality sex education, we can make big changes closer to home. More states can follow the lead of California and implement policies that require comprehensive, inclusive sex education. Others can find courage in New York's example and challenge dangerous, misleading programs masquerading as sex ed. We can create a demand too big to be denied. Our country is at a crossroads, and our children are watching closely. During Tuesday night's address, they'll see that some of our national leaders are taking the MeToo conversation seriously. This conversation needs to happen at home, too. Now is the moment to make an impact on how young people approach interpersonal relationships for the rest of their lives. Let's not let them down. ] ",

Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: \"It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all.\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the \"bureaucratic burden\" on teachers.     Funding 'tight' But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to \"answer the question\" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: \"I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic.\"  Image copyrightEPAImage caption Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy  In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a \"top priority\". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the \"biggest threats\" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years, [recruitment targets for teaching have been missed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42340798) and schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending \\xa3835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures.  Freeze on exam changes The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: \"With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. \"And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. \"Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn.\" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead.  Teacher 'burnout' Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained \"if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession\", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against \"entirely unnecessary\" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called \"mocksteds\". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. \"In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them.\" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: \"This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. \"If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.\"  ] ",

Blockchain technology \"The [blockchain](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-safe-way-to-bet-on- blockchain-amid-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-craze/)\" became a buzzword about two years ago, coming onto the scene simultaneously with AI, Rafferty said. Blockchain is the ledger system behind digital currencies. But where AI has since been adopted by any number of industry sectors, blockchain is much less developed. \"Blockchain has not advanced as much, but because of cryptocurrency, there's so much interest in it.\" she said. \"There was a lot of debate -- are we able to crunch that kind of data? Do we have the power sources?\" \"There's a lot of infrastructure areas they're looking at to make it real,\" she said, \"but certainly the vision is there.\"  3\\. Concern about the oceans \"Sustainability and climate change continue to be a key theme,\" Rafferty said. \"You heard a lot this year about the [oceans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news /ocean-pollution-united-nations-environmental-summit/)... people are very concerned about more plastics being in the ocean than fish,\" she said. \"There's a lot of concern about drilling and things that are going to happen in our oceans.\"     4\\. Women's issues have taken center stage When Rafferty first attended the meeting in Davos seven years ago, she was\\xa0[frequently mistaken](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/31/are-you-a-spouse- no-im-a-ceocommentary.html)\\xa0for a spouse, she recalls. \"It was the fist time I felt like a minority.\" But, as concerns over women's equity have moved to center stage, she said, that's no longer the case. \"What started as a female issue became a business issue,\" Rafferty said. \"This year, female topics -- whether it was pay equity, equality -- really moved from the side room and what I call an 'HR topic' to being a C-suite topic.\"\\xa0 \"There were actually men by themselves talking\" about closing the gender gap, she noted.\\xa0 And the business case for promoting gender equality is clear, she added. \"When you have a more diverse slate of senior executives, and a more diverse board and business, you're going to be more profitable.\"\\xa0  5\\. The importance of reskilling \"Another theme that I saw this week was the concept of reskilling,\" Rafferty said. \"When you're 22 and you graduate, in our day, you thought you had everything.\" But, she said, \"our education system is first Industrial Revolution where we're fourth industrial revolution. With AI, with technology, with everything changing, there are jobs that are going to go away. We're going to have to reskill the workforce, whether you're at a big corporation, or in a factory. \"To do an overhaul of curriculum, and an overhaul with adults that are already working,\" Rafferty added, \"it's going to take what Davos proposes -- a lot of people working together, and a lot of collaboration, to get there.\"\\xa0  ] ",

Some of those affect public schools, as does actions taken by some state boards of education. A few states passed laws requiring public schools to offer free tampons and other feminine hygiene products in bathrooms. There were newly mandated subjects: Virginia became the first state to set mandatory computer science standards, while California passed a law requiring schools to offer students in grades 7-12 [education and training on human trafficking identification and prevention](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1227). Here are some of the new laws and board mandates that will affect public schools (and[ you can see many others on a long list of education topics at this database](http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/education-bill-tracking- database.aspx)): **CALIFORNIA:** Among new laws affecting public schools in the state are, [according to this list ](http://newsroom.ocde.us/new-2018-education-laws-include-ending-meal- shaming/)from the Orange County Department of Education: **Ending 8meal shaming 9** It 9s a little hard to believe this was happening in some school districts, but in some districts, schools would give a snack 4 or nothing 4 to students whose parents were not current in their school lunch payments. And some officials actually reprimanded kids while they were in line for lunch 4 or stamped their hands 4 so the kids could remind their parents to pay up. A new law bars what is called cmeal shaming. **Water testing at schools** All public schools are now required to test their water supplies for lead every year and let parents know if the water is considered not safe for drinking. A safe water source would then be found for students. **Human trafficking education** Students in grades 7-12 in public schools must be offered\\xa0[education and training on human trafficking identification and prevention](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1227). **Improving hygiene\\xa0** Some public schools[ must provide feminine hygiene products](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10), including tampons, in at least half of the bathrooms on campus 4 and give them out free. The law covers schools with any combination of\\xa0 classes from grade 6 to grade 12, with at least 40 percent of the student population coming from low-income families. **FLORIDA** **Charter funding** Gov. Rick Scott (R) [signed into law](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/31/its-hard-to-overstate-how-much-critics-hate- floridas-scam-education-bill-will-the-governor-veto- it/?utm_term=.445222aece70) education [funding measures ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/06/15/florida- governor-is-signing-k-12-public-education-bill-that-critics-call-a-scam-at-a -catholic-school/?utm_term=.f752252421b9)that will, among other things, provide millions of dollars to help charter schools. Several school boards in the state have sued. ** 8Best and Brightest 9** The legislature voted to expand a highly controversial program called cFlorida 9s Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarships, which gives big bonuses to teachers with high student SAT and ACT scores (and strong evaluations). This is not about rewarding teachers whose students get high test scores but who themselves got high scores on these exams 4 even if it was decades ago. Some teachers who never took one of the college admissions tests\\xa0\\xa0 4 they may have started out in community colleges 4 are taking the tests now to qualify for the bonuses. **Textbook challenges** In what critics call[ an assault on science education](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/04/22 /what-the-latest-assaults-on-science-education-look- like/?utm_term=.1f9d9262b24d), a new law makes it easier for residents to object to the use of instructional materials in the public schools. Two obvious targets of the law: climate change and evolution. **KENTUCKY** **Student religious expression** A new law supporters say is aimed at protecting students 9 religious expression at school was passed after Gov. Matt Bevin (R) declared 2017 cThe Year of the Bible and in reaction to a move in 2015 by a school to remove a Bible verse spoken by the character Linus in a production of\\xa0 cA Charlie Brown Christmas. The law says it allows students to voluntarily express religious or political viewpoints in school assignments free from discrimination. It further requires that local boards of education make sure that the selection of student speakers is made in a viewpoint- neutral manner and that the student 9s prepared remarks are not altered before delivery without\\xa0 the student 9s consent. It also says that religious and political organizations are allowed equal access to public forums on the same basis as nonreligious and nonpolitical organizations, and that recognized student organizations 00 including religious ones 4 should not be c 8hindered \\u2026 against in the ordering of their own affairs, including the selection of leaders and members. Critics say the law gives school groups a legal right to discriminate against LGBTQ and other students. **\\xa0Bible literacy courses** A new law requires that Bible literacy courses be offered in public schools. The law says that the Kentucky Board of Education must set administrative regulations cto establish an elective social studies course on the Hebrew Scriptures, Old Testament of the Bible, the New Testament, or a combination of the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament of the Bible. It crequires that the course provide to students knowledge of biblical content, characters, poetry, and narratives that are prerequisites to understanding contemporary society and culture, including literature, art, music. **ILLINOIS** **School tax credit** The legislature approved a $75 million tax credit for people and companies donating to private school scholarships, a nod to school choice favored by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Donors can receive a credit worth 75 percent of a donation with a maximum of $1 million. **Feminine hygiene** In a move similar to the one in California, the Illinois legislature passed a new law requiring all schools to provide feminine hygiene products such as tampons and sanitary napkins free in bathrooms of schools with grades 6 through 12. [The law says in part:](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=100-0163) > Feminine hygiene products are a health care necessity and not an item that can be foregone or substituted easily.  > (2) Access to feminine hygiene products is a serious and ongoing need in this State.  > (3) When students do not have access to affordable feminine hygiene products, they may miss multiple days of school\\xa0 every month.  > (4) When students have access to quality feminine hygiene products, they are able to continue with their daily lives with minimal interruption. **MARYLAND** **Low-performing schools** The legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Larry Hogan (R) to pass a law limiting options for how school districts should deal with low-performing schools. It bans the use of charter school conversions, voucher programs, and the creation of a crecovery school district that oversees low-performing schools. **School security** The state 9s Center for School Safety is now authorized to make grants with public funds for specified security-related projects to schools and child care centers that are determined to be at risk of certain hate crimes or attacks. The schools can be public or private and can use the funding for additional security training needs, security personnel, security cameras, security-related technology, door-hardening, improved lightning, or other security-related upgrades. **TENNESSEE** **School buses** School bus drivers must now be at least 25 years old, a reaction to a 2016 school bus crash that killed six children that occurred when, police said, a 24-year-old driver was speeding while taking a call on his cellphone. The law sets other requirements for bus drivers 4 but doesn 9t require that new school buses have seat belts (a different approach than Texas, as you can see below). **TEXAS** **School buses** School districts buying new school buses must ensure that they are equipped with shoulder-to-lap seat belts, a reaction to a 2015 accident in which a school bus in Houston flew off a bypass and children died. **VIRGINIA** **Computer Science** Virginia became the first state to adopt mandatory standards for all districts in computer science, a year after. In November, the state Board of Education in Virginia approved the standards even though some members were concerned that they may be too ambitious. The [Richmond Times- Dispatch](http://www.fredericksburg.com/news/education/virginia-will-require- computer-science-education-in-high-school/article_42ef33e1-1371-50f3-8d3e- 0505a847d704.html) quoted Anne Holton, the education secretary of Virginia, as saying: > cThe standards, they seem ambitious to me, These are not meant as aspirational standards, they are meant as a mandate that our teachers need to be able to teach. > > cWe 9re clearly leading the nation and that puts an extra burden on us to get it right. ] ",

      "article": "[ The UN has painted a grim picture of the human rights situation in the United Arab Emirates ([UAE](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/uae.html)), raising concern over the torture of prisoners, injustice against foreign workers and discrimination of women in the Gulf state.  A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has shed light on the suppression of freedom of expression and the undue influence of executive authorities and security services on the judiciary in the Emirati state.\\xa0  The 13-page report was prepared on January 5 and is expected to be presented at the 29th session of the Human Rights Council, which will run from January 15 to 26.  \"UAE authorities regularly subject those that violate their restrictions to torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and unfair trial procedures,\" the UK-based Emirate Centre for Human Rights, [wrote](https://twitter.com/ECHRIGHTS/status/950760375875710977) on its Twitter page.   {articleGUID}   In its report, the UN body expressed regret over the UAE's failure to establish a national human rights institution in accordance with international standards.  The report argued that the justice system in the UAE is complex and impedes migrant workers and the stateless from bringing their grievances to justice.  On free speech, the UN body cited imprisonment and trials for people who had simply expressed their views or criticised institutions.  The commission also condemned arrests and forced disappearances outside the legal framework and the transfer of people to secret prisons under the pretext of being accused of \"terrorism\".  UAE authorities have used torture to force defendants to confess to the charges against them and deprive them of healthcare, the report said.   **Activists, women, migrants**  Prominent Emirati human rights activist [Ahmed Mansoor](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/letter-calls-uae-release- ahmed-mansoor-170627203939193.html) was detained in Abu Dhabi last year\\xa0and is accused of using social media to \"publish false information and rumours\" and \"promote sectarianism and hatred\".  Mansoor is being held in solitary confinement without access to a lawyer or calls to his family, according to human rights groups.\\xa0  OHCHR\\xa0called for the release of Mansoor, as well online activist Osama Najjar, Jordanian journalist Tayseer al-Najjar and academic Nasser bin Ghaith.  After the report's release, rights campaigners protested outside the UAE embassy in London last week to call for the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience.  \"ICFUAE calls upon the Emirati authorities to abide by its obligations under international law and safeguard the rights of those residing within its borders,\" [said](https://twitter.com/ICFUAE/status/950356751324459008) the UK- based group International Campaign for Freedom in the United Arab Emirates, which organised the peaceful demonstration.\\xa0  >  > > [Ahmed_Mansoor](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ahmed_Mansoor?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw) has an unimpeachable record as a defender of rights and freedoms, and every day he remains in prison will constitute a black mark on the [UAE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/UAE?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw)'s human rights record[FreeAhmed](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeAhmed?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw) [pic.twitter.com/04TAdw8gDi](https://t.co/04TAdw8gDi) > > \\r 4 Emirates Centre 4HR (@ECHRIGHTS) [January 9, 2018](https://twitter.com/ECHRIGHTS/status/950690769945362432?ref_src=twsrc^tfw)  In its report, the UN body also pointed to the lack of transparency and independence of UAE's courts, where judges and prosecutors are often influenced by the executive authorities and state security officials.       ---   WATCH: [UAE accused of abuse in secret Yemen prisons (2:00)](https://youtu.be/Sv2xibCjjUo)     In the case of women, the committee was concerned\\xa0that it was still possible for a husband to prohibit his wife from working and to limit her freedom of movement.  The OHCHR urged the UAE to immediately repeal that restriction and review other provisions that impeded women's free choice of profession and employment.  For migrant workers,\\xa0the organisation recognised progress was made with the labour law reforms aimed at abolishing the Kafala system.\\xa0  The work sponsorship system, known as Kafala in the Gulf, currently requires all foreign workers to obtain their employer's consent to travel abroad or switch jobs.  However, the UN regretted the abusive work practices, such as confiscating passports, false imprisonment, denied salaries and nonpayment of overtime, that migrant workers face in the country.\\xa0  The report warned that children continue to be trafficked into the UAE for sexual exploitation or forced begging and then deported without proper identification.\\xa0 ] ",

(Tasos Katopodis/European Pressphoto Agency) The most significant revelation in a new Pew Research Center [analysis](http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing- educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/) of partisan identification is the extent to which Democrats and Republicans no longer resemble one another demographically. Nearly 4 in 10 Democrats are nonwhite, while 83 percent of Republicans are white. Six in 10 Republicans are whites without a college degree; only a third of Democrats are. A third of Republicans are white evangelical Christians; a third of Democrats are religiously unaffiliated. Pew 9s data highlighted two consistent trends: Women are much more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans, while men are more split. White Americans (as was probably obvious from the paragraph above) are more likely to identify as Republican, and nonwhite Americans as Democrats 4 no group more so than black Americans. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t2cR2QV8FwgNeJkXr-jBoeOvNXc=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXEQPGP664YGJIW5P4TX6OGW64.png)  Understandably, the widening gap on education in Pew 9s data attracted a great deal of attention. College-educated Americans are much more likely to be Democrats than Republicans 4 and to an increasing extent. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hMLL-dWm5XIY8b_9Be4fDjZw8tw=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7W4PB4LX2E2PDBQMTMMW4SR5CU.png)  To some extent, this overlaps with age. Older Americans are [less likely](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf) to have college educations. Pew breaks out its age categories into generations, a [subjective distinction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/01/stop- wasting-your-life-worrying-about-what-generation-youre-in/) but one that makes it easier to talk about age groups. Americans born before 1946 are more likely to be Republican than Democrat by a nine-point margin. Boomers, the post-World War II generation, lean slightly Democratic. Generation X, slightly more so. And then there are millennials. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U3JzTtT5U5d-0rVvd_O4a8YR0_c=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EYKQL5ZCSQYP3NUTQV3FDQMAFI.png)  That gap between Republican and Democratic identification is generally seen as very bad news for Republicans. After all, millennials will be around a lot longer than people who were alive during World War II. Given that at no point have they preferred Republicans to Democrats, it suggests significant long- term problems for the GOP. One reason millennials lean more Democratic is that the group is also more racially diverse than older Americans. But the Democratic advantage among millennials exists even within groups that, overall, tend to identify as Republicans: men and whites. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EkKbbtIXOWnAmmqrpc2C4LFcRJM=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MIHSPX4L345H5NJN272OODZEZ4.png)  But that 9s a little misleading. Millennial men includes nonwhite men; white millennials includes women. If we isolate white, male millennials, the picture changes. Young white men identify as Republican. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HoM_dnajB888e4jKD3MjhcuoLIU=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E2KN6UELTE6Y3GKRW7ELXSONZE.png)  We 9ve seen this evidenced elsewhere. In January, PRRI and MTV [released](https://www.prri.org/research/mtv-culture-and-religion/) a report looking at the political views of young Americans. That focused on the post- millennial generation, which is yet to be named. (MTV likes cFounders, which, [hmm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2015/12/03/mtv-wants-to-call-the-next-generation-the-founders-sorry- but-no/).) Many of the findings center on race:  * More than half of white men (and white women) in this age group believe that discrimination against whites is as significant as discrimination against other groups.  * Fewer than half of young white men say black people face a lot of discrimination.  * A quarter of young white men say white men face a lot of discrimination.  * Opinions of Barack Obama were much lower among young white men. More than half of white men in this group expressed a favorable opinion of President Trump.  * Half of young white men favor building the U.S.-Mexico border wall. There 9s [an existing question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2016/07/08/is-political-polarization-making-racial-tensions- worse/?utm_term=.21d60d9961b4) of the extent to which the increasing racial divide between the parties overlaps with increasing partisan animosity. Trump 9s election was clearly dependent to a large extent on issues that intersected with race. (In nearly every state, voters most worried about the economy [preferred Hillary Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2016/12/02/in-nearly-every-swing-state-voters-preferred-hillary- clinton-on-the-economy/) in 2016 while those most worried about immigration or terrorism backed Trump.) The Republican candidate was successful after stoking racial fears; even before the election, most Americans thought Trump 9s rhetoric [appealed to bigotry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2016/09/01/7-percent-of-donald-trump-supporters-think-hes- racist/?utm_term=.6eaf4a3dd2bb). The PRRI data suggests that this is not simply a function of older white Americans worried about the shifting demographics of the United States. The Pew data suggests that younger white men are more likely to support Trump 9s party than any other part of their generation. This survey still presents a worrisome future for the GOP as the nation grows less white and as millennials increasingly make up more of the electorate. (Per Pew 9s definitions, millennials and Gen Xers [cast more votes](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/31/millennials-and-gen- xers-outvoted-boomers-and-older-generations-in-2016-election/) in 2016 than older generations.) But the party 9s appeal to white men, a group that makes up a plurality of its membership, continues. ] ",

      "article": "[ WASHINGTON 4 When Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began rolling back regulations to curb the predatory practices of for-profit colleges, critics seethed that the Trump administration was throwing yet another lifeline to a rapacious industry 4 in this case, one that sees vulnerable undergraduates as nothing more than moneymaking targets. , Henry N. Tisdale, the president of the small campus of Claflin University in Orangeburg, S.C., disagrees. , Since the Obama administration announced that it would establish a smoother pathway for students to claim that they had been misled by their colleges, Mr. Tisdale said he has feared an expensive legal battle over the smallest leaflet advertising a service on campus. ,  cA small mistake or error at a college like Claflin could put us out of business, Mr. Tisdale said. cWe don 9t have the resources ready to respond to frivolous claims. , Mr. Tisdale and his counterparts at other small, historically black colleges and universities are among an unlikely cohort of supporters for Ms. DeVos 9s effort to tighten a wide-ranging regulation that offers federal debt relief to students who were defrauded or deceived by their higher- education institutions. , While the rules targeted for-profit colleges with billion-dollar budgets, they apply to all institutions 4 including small, nonprofit colleges like Claflin that have been educating low-income, minority and first-generation students for more than a century without scandal. ,  cIt 9s a regulation that should be focused on the bad actors, and we have been lumped in when we 9re serving the students the bad actors are preying on, Mr. Tisdale said. cWe believe it should be improved to prevent unintended consequences. , Ms. DeVos 9s plans to overhaul the Obama-era rules for student borrowers reached a crucial stage this week, as a committee convened to renegotiate the regulations began debating the burden of proof students would have to meet to win claims against institutions. , The Education Department has proposed that students establish cclear and convincing evidence that institutions misled them, compared with a cpreponderance of evidence standard applied under the Obama administration. Students would also have to prove that institutions had an cintent to deceive, cknowledge of falsity and creckless disregard that resulted in financial harm to borrowers. , Officials in the department said during negotiations this week that they believed the current preponderance-of-evidence standard did not sufficiently protect taxpayers and institutions. , But Joseline Garcia, a negotiator on the panel and the president of the United States Student Association, said she believed the new standard swung too far in the opposite direction. , ** c** I think that switching to 8clear and convincing 9 does the opposite for students, Ms. Garcia said. cIt doesn 9t protect them at all. , She added: cAlthough the institution may have made an honest mistake, the harm is still the same for the student. And people 9s lives are greatly impacted by that harm. , Ms. DeVos has cast the Obama-era regulations as taxpayer-funded money grabs. In announcing the repeal of the rules, she said that institutions of all types raised concerns about cexcessively broad definitions of substantial misrepresentation and breach of contract, the lack of meaningful due process protections for institutions and 8financial triggers 9 under the new rules. , The United Negro College Fund, which has joined the chorus of criticism over the Trump administration 9s lack of tangible commitment to historically black colleges and universities, has long been among the most vocal opponents of the Obama-era rules. , Since the rules were announced in 2015, the college fund has expressed concern that they could threaten the viability of its 37 member institutions, which include Claflin, Spelman College, Morehouse College and Shaw University. The member institutions collectively educate 60,000 students on campuses of about 2,000 or fewer, and 75 percent of their students receive federal Pell grants. , The fund has said that the rules have a disproportionately negative effect on their member institutions because they have historically been underfinanced and serve vulnerable populations. , They fear having to spend thousands of dollars fighting claims instead of backing academic programming at institutions that have been graduating students who consistently post [high success and satisfaction rates. ](https://www.uncf.org/hbcu-impact) , Representatives at the United Negro College Fund are among the panelists hashing out the new standards and are in a unique position of having to represent both students and institutions. ,  cWe want to make sure this is a balanced process, said Lodriguez V. Murray, one of the college fund 9s members on the federal negotiating team. cWe 9re protecting students and the institutions that are giving them a chance to fall into the middle class. , Consumer rights and student advocates say the new standards essentially ask students who probably cannot afford to hire lawyers to become them. ,  cThe administration is effectively asking borrowers to have conducted a full investigation, with the power of discovery, that turns up some very severe findings from their institution before filing a borrower-defense claim, said Clare McCann, the deputy director for federal higher education policy at the New America Foundation. , Education Department officials on the rule-making committee said they could not outline how a student would meet the new burden of proof. But they said they believed, based on the claims that they have reviewed, that students could meet the standards if they were informed about them. , But others on the committee expressed concerns that the department had another goal. ,  cThis would effectively do away with borrowers 9 ability to get relief in almost all circumstances, said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center. , The department has struggled to complete a backlog of borrower-defense claims, [the bulk of which were overwhelmingly against for-profit colleges](https://tcf.org/content/report/college-complaints-unmasked/), that began pouring in under the Obama administration and swelled to more than 100,000 in the last year. The department attributed the backlog, in part, to an insufficient system established under the Obama administration, which relieved students of $450 million in loan debt after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. , Ms. DeVos [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/politics/for- profit-universities-debt-relief-devos.html?_r=0) last month that her department would begin notifying more than 20,000 students whether their claims had been approved. Some would see only partial relief under the new system. , Lawyers who represent institutions on the negotiating team said that due process standards were crucial to their constituents because colleges could be held liable for some of the student debt ,  cWe all have bad actors. But in trying to get to the bad guys, are you allocating too much risk on the good guys? asked Aaron Lacey, a lawyer at Thompson Coburn L.L.P., which represents schools in regulatory litigation. , In addition to establishing a new burden of proof for student borrowers who feel defrauded, the department is relaxing financial accountability rules for institutions. Those so-called triggers would have required colleges to take a series of steps to demonstrate their financial health. , One such trigger that the United Negro College Fund opposed would have penalized schools if they had a high number of students defaulting on their loans. ([Statistics show that the populations that black colleges serve tend to have higher default rates.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/17 /half-black-student-loan-borrowers-default-new-federal-data-show)) That trigger was stricken from the new proposed standards, while others that applied solely to for-profits remained but were made discretionary rather than required. ] ",

Primary school students at a school in the Chinese district of Shunqing were faced with this question on a paper: \"If a ship had 26 sheep and 10 goats onboard, how old is the ship's captain?\" The question appeared on a recent fifth-grade level paper, intended for children around 11 years old. Pictures of the question, along with students' valiant attempts at answers, surfaced this week on Chinese social media - where it triggered debate and quickly went viral. Education officials later said the question was not a mistake, but meant to highlight \"critical awareness\".     Image copyrightWeiboImage caption It is not clear how many points the question (circled) was worth or if it was part of a bonus section  \"The captain is at least 18 because he has to be an adult to drive the ship,\" one student answered. \"The captain is 36, because 26+10 is 36 and the captain wanted them to add up to his age,\" another guessed. One student however, simply gave up. \"The captain's age is... I don't know. I can't solve this.\"   * [Chinese schools 'robbing young of individuality'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34605430)   * [China's students take on dreaded Gaokao](/news/world-asia-china-36457453)   * ['In 1977 I took an exam that changed China'](/news/world-asia-china-42135342)   * [Would Chinese-style education work on British kids?](/news/magazine-33735517)  Online, however, people weren't quite as generous. \"This question makes no logical sense at all.

Some however, defended the school - which has not been named - saying the question promoted critical thinking. \"The whole point of it is to make the students think. It's done that,\" one person commented. \"This question forces children to explain their thinking and gives them space to be creative. We should have more questions like this,\" another said.  'Think outside the box' [The Shunqing Education Department posted a statement on the 26 January](http://news.sina.com.cn/s/wh/2018-01-27/doc-ifyqzcxh0729685.shtml) saying the test had intended to \"examine... critical awareness and an ability to think independently\". \"Some surveys show that primary school students in our country lack a sense of critical awareness in regard to mathematics,\" it said. The traditional Chinese method of education heavily emphasises on note-taking and repetition, known as rote learning, which critics say hinders creative thinking. But the department said questions like the boat one \"enable students to challenge boundaries and think out of the box\". And of course, there's always that one person that has all the answers. \"The total weight of 26 sheep and 10 goat is 7,700kg, based on the average weight of each animal,\" said one Weibo commenter. \"In China, if you're driving a ship that has more than 5,000kg of cargo you need to have possessed a boat license for five years. The minimum age for getting a boat's license is 23, so he's at least 28.\"  ] ",

She was 70. The cause was complications from pneumonia, said her son Zach Cafritz. She had severe health problems in recent years, including back surgeries and a gallbladder operation that left her in a coma for more than a week. Ms. Cooper Cafritz came from a prosperous black business family in Mobile, Ala., but the family 9s standing in the community did not insulate them from indignities of the Jim Crow South. Galvanized by the civil rights movement, Ms. Cooper Cafritz arrived in Washington in 1964 to attend George Washington University, where she was determined to end the vestiges of racial segregation on campus. By her senior year, she had organized a black student union and helped force many fraternities and sororities to adopt race-blind charters. She also co- created a pilot workshop in creative arts in summer 1968 that she fostered into the [Duke Ellington School of the Arts](http://www.ellingtonschool.org \"www.ellingtonschool.org\").

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, left, and Ms. Cooper Cafritz, in 2017. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Over five decades, Ms. Cooper Cafritz became a fixture of Washington 9s educational, cultural and charitable firmament, as much a socialite as a social activist as she married into and bitterly divorced out of the Cafritz real estate and philanthropic fortune. Her social orbit included Bill Clinton, Gloria Steinem, Quincy Jones, Vernon Jordan and Alma Powell, the wife of retired Gen. Colin L. Powell. She amassed one of the [largest private collections](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002925.html?tid=a_inl \"www.washingtonpost.com\") of African American and African art, much of which was [destroyed in 2009](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073004226.html \"www.washingtonpost.com\") by a fire at her hilltop mansion on Washington 9s tony Chain Bridge Road NW. Her estate became a salon where, with formal charm and brusque efficiency, she linked the policymakers, cultural leaders and real estate developers of official and unofficial Washington. She was a constant presence on the political fundraising circuit, and as an arts reviewer on [ cAround Town, d](https://weta.org/tv/local/aroundtown \"weta.org\") a program on the Washington public TV station WETA. She also was chairman emeritus of the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities and a board member of arts institutions such as the Kennedy Center. She said her overarching mission was cto bridge the great divides among the city 9s factions in arts and politics. cThe majority of power in this city is black, and the majority of money is white, she told The Washington Post in 1979. cWe 9ve got to bring the two together. At some point in this society, everything has to converge. She took a personal step in that direction in 1981, when she married her longtime companion, Conrad Cafritz, a scion of one of Washington 9s wealthiest families. cI met him on the telephone, she once recalled to The Post. cHe called me to ask me for a reference for somebody. I said, 8That person is an [expletive]. 9 He said, 8That 9s an interesting response. Can we meet? 9  During their long courtship, they cut a striking profile as one of the few mixed-race couples in the city 9s elite. But the marriage rapidly grew troubled. Her lawyers claimed in divorce proceedings in the late 1990s that Conrad Cafritz creferred to their relationship as a 8European style 9 marriage, with each being free to have sexual relations with others as they desire, despite Mrs. Cafritz 9s wishes to the contrary. In his court filings, according to The Post, Conrad Cafritz disputed many of the allegations. After reaching a settlement, Ms. Cooper Cafritz retained the home, with its tennis and basketball courts and pool, as well as a secretary, cook, housekeeper and driver. The Post, citing a source familiar with her finances, wrote in 2002 that she received about $600,000 annually in child support, alimony and investment income.

In the wake of her divorce, Ms. Cooper Cafritz devoted her energies to pursuing elective office. In 2000, she vied successfully for the D.C. school board presidency, positioning herself as a revolutionary outsider. She was elected just as the federally appointed D.C. financial control board was returning control of the troubled school system to the school board. The school board was long a battleground, but many education officials told The Post that it became less effective and [more polarized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/05/21/a-is- for-activist/bd2ce6fe-fdd7-4558-9af5-4727699eb0e0/?utm_term=.c78a8ba60913 \"www.washingtonpost.com\") during Ms. Cooper Cafritz 9s time as president. With a penchant for closed-door decision-making, she was perceived as aloof and authoritarian. She was unfiltered in her public remarks, decrying unqualified and incompetent teachers plaguing the school system. She also drew a link between feckless parenting and children with special needs. cThe reason we have so many special education students, she once said, cis you have children who have no father, and they go home to a mother who 9s on the couch eating potato chips and she pays no attention to the child, and he comes back to school and he wants attention, so he acts out. She [provoked bewilderment](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/05/whopper_of_the_week_peggy_cooper_cafritz.html \"www.slate.com\") by taking strong positions for and against school vouchers, which enable parents to use public money to send their children to private or parochial schools. Once, she claimed that a hacker penned an anti-voucher essay that appeared under her name, on her own website, before ultimately confessing that she had helped write it. To supporters, she was a dogged champion of accountability in an unwieldy bureaucracy that no one person could fix. To her detractors, she was a bully. She and members of the D.C. Council sniped at each other in meetings over matters petty and large, and she gradually lost the backing of then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D). By the time she declined to run for reelection, she was credited with doing little to advance the 55,000-student system, although she reached for her own checkbook to replenish school library shelves. As her tenure drew to an end, she personally took out a $40,000, full-page advertisement in The Post that trumpeted her service, noting an uptick in students going to college.  cThere are a lot of people who I can make scream when they hear my name, she told the newspaper in 2006. cI think a lot of people can 9t stand the fact that I 9m a rich lady on the hill. They think I couldn 9t possibly give a damn about the kids. They also don 9t appreciate the fact that I say what I think. Longtime political commentator Mark Plotkin called Ms. Cooper Cafritz ca controversial, provocative figure in a city that does not embrace bureaucratic mavericks.  cShe had many detractors, he said, cbut what cannot be taken away from her is the singular achievement of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. She was not a consensus builder or namby-pamby if she wanted to accomplish something. Nurturing young artists Pearl Alice Cooper, who later officially changed her name to Peggy, was born in Mobile on April\\xa07, 1947. Her parents owned a mortuary and life insurance business. When one of her older brothers was denied a place in an all-white Catholic high school, her parents decreed that their six children would be educated out of state at private schools. The financial strain eventually was a cause of her father 9s suicide, the family told reporters.  cMy father often said to me that he wanted me to be as comfortable sitting in a melon patch as I would be in an audience with the Queen of England, Ms. Cooper Cafritz once told The Post, cas comfortable reading Aquinas as I would be reading W.E.B. Du Bois. You are supposed to be wherever you are, he said. I never felt any fear about where I belonged. After graduating in 1964 from St. Mary 9s, a predominantly white Catholic boarding school in South Bend, Ind., Ms. Cooper Cafritz returned home and, along with friends, organized an effort to test the newly passed civil rights law outlawing racial discrimination in public facilities. She recalled being spat on by white youths at a drive-in. That fall, she entered GWU as one of the few blacks on campus, drawing media attention with her efforts to challenge de facto segregation. She rushed various sororities. That she cdidn 9t measure up Hellenistically, as The Post wryly expressed it at the time, came as no shock to her. As a founder of the Black Students Union, she pushed the student government and administration to demand that Greek organizations on campus prohibit discrimination or shutter. The measure passed in 1968. Although she graduated in 1968 and received her law degree in 1971, she said she had no intention of practicing law. The cEsq. after her name, she said, would cincrease my credibility and open a lot of doors. The origins of Duke Ellington reached back to 1968, when she staged a black arts festival and arranged for inner-city youths to be bused to campus to see exhibitions of black dance, art, music, literature and clothing. Meeting teenagers who were ctalented but very raw impelled her and a friend 4 director and choreographer [Mike Malone](http://www.washingtonpost.com /wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/05/AR2006120501511.html \"www.washingtonpost.com\") 4 to create a summer arts workshop for high- schoolers. Ms. Cooper Cafritz saw creative promise in the most troubled of the lot.  cWhy does a kid get kicked out of school? she once asked a Post interviewer rhetorically. cBecause he 9s in trouble. And if you think about it, he 9s had to design the architecture of the trouble. Wow 4 he must really have something on the ball. **** Over the next several years, she almost single-handedly collected millions of dollars to help the program evolve into the Duke Ellington school, housed at the site of the former Western High School in Georgetown. She spoke of the Ellington school as a vital social juncture, commingling students of all races and economic backgrounds bound by a common devotion to the arts. The school, now highly competitive, underwent a major renovation that was completed in 2017 with $100\\xa0million in cost overruns. In the 1970s, amid her rising profile in the community, Ms. Cooper Cafritz became the youngest fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and served on a committee that created the University of the District of Columbia from two other academic institutions. She was a programming executive and documentary producer for WTOP-TV in Washington and an assistant to the president of Post-Newsweek Stations Inc. She also worked briefly with entertainer Harry Belafonte and [M.

In addition to raising three children, Ms. Cooper Cafritz became guardian and godmother to dozens of youngsters over the decades, often paying for their educations. Survivors include her children, Arcelie Reyes of Newark, Vt., and Zach Cafritz and Cooper Cafritz, both of Washington; two brothers, A.J. Cooper of Fairhope, Ala., and Jerome G.

It became apparent that for nearly three years I had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more. As we are both BBC staff that means I have not just missed out on pay, but on pension contributions too. I am told that we are now being paid at the same rate per day, but there is no transparency.\"  2\\. Former BBC Scotland health correspondent Eleanor Bradford \"I was BBC Scotland's health correspondent from 2001 to 2016. I discovered I was one of the lowest paid correspondents at BBC Scotland, despite regularly appearing on UK-wide news and delivering exclusive stories. I regularly asked for a pay rise, and eventually cited equal pay legislation. This led to an immediate increase of \\xa35,000 but it was not backdated. I remained around \\xa310,000 below some male colleagues who were doing identical correspondent jobs. In one of my annual appraisals I was told I was a 'model correspondent'. I left the BBC.\"  3\\. National radio presenter \"I am an award-winning broadcaster with more than 20 years' experience. In 2014, I was offered a contract to present a flagship arts programme. Two men with no broadcasting experience who had also been given trial shifts presenting the programme during the search for a new presenter were paid 25% more per programme. Then I found out that the existing male presenter was being paid 50% more than me per programme. When I asked for the pay gap to be corrected the line manager told me 'the BBC doesn't do equal pay', and that in raising the issue I was being 'aggressive'. I refused to back down and eventually was given the same rate as my male colleague and it was backdated.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption Auditors PwC published a report on BBC pay on Tuesday  4\\. Reporter \"My full-time equivalent salary for making identical programmes is about half my male counterpart's. I challenged my grade and asked for an equal pay review. The BBC took months to deal with my enquiry and refused to recognise that it was a claim for my legal right to equal pay for equivalent work. Eventually I was offered a series of increases adding up to a total of between 20-25%, with minimal back pay, which I felt I had no option but to accept because of the stress involved. It has brought me nowhere close to the salary of my male colleague. He also gets extra resources for his programmes, at the expense of others. I don't resent my male colleague. He is talented and deserves it. But we need parity of pay, resources and opportunity.\"  5\\. National broadcaster \"Since July I have been offered a 65% pay rise, whilst also being told that the BBC is 'satisfied there was no issue of equal pay' in my case. In pay terms this offer would bring me in line with the lowest paid of the presenters who work on the same programme as I do. That is despite my longer service on that programme. In contractual terms I am still disadvantaged as, unlike fellow presenters, I am not on full staff so have not benefited from pension rights accrued over many years.\"  6\\. News programme presenter \"When I was appointed to my current job in October 2013, there followed six months of negotiations over my salary. It was eventually set at \\xa353,600 for three days per week. In absolute terms I am well paid and I recognise and appreciate this. However, at the time this sum was agreed, I had no idea of how my pay compared to that of my fellow presenters. On publication of the 'talent list' in July 2017, I learnt that I am paid hundreds of thousands less than some of my colleagues. I am also paid \\xa345,000 less than my immediate male predecessor. No-one has explained to me how such a discrepancy can be justified.\"  7\\. Sports broadcaster \"I have worked for the BBC for almost 30 years, both staff and freelance. I present major sports coverage on national radio. In 2017 my contract was worth \\xa319,000 for 50 days, reporting and presenting. This is an average day rate of \\xa3380. When I present one of the flagship radio sports programmes I am paid \\xa3500. I have been told the male presenter is paid \\xa31,200. Since raising the issue of equal pay I have been offered \\xa3650 which is still a long way short of equal pay. What you are worth is solely at the whim of management who essentially in sport are always men. I'm at the top of my game, knowledgeable and with three decades of experience, yet I'm scratching around to earn a living.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption The BBC's director general Tony Hall will address the select committee on Wednesday  8\\. UK-based on-air editor \"In 2017 I discovered one of the male UK-based editors reporting for the same flagship programmes is paid between 50% and 100% more. Since then it has become apparent other male on-air editors making equivalent news pieces, for the same news programmes, are also paid significantly more. The BBC has refused to accept there is an equal pay issue, but offered me an on-the-spot 10% increase. I have not accepted as it does not resolve the wider issue around pay inequality.\"  9\\. Nations and regions presenter \"I have co-presented with a male colleague for many years. Despite working fewer hours than me, he earns more. Pro-rata, I estimate he's paid around double what I earn for doing the same job. Both colleagues and the public would consider us equals. I raised the equal pay issue many times over the years, but nothing was done.\"  10\\. Sport editor \"I lead a sports team in a big city with Premier League teams in our patch. There are few women in equivalent jobs, none in a big city. I believe I have been paid less than my male counterparts across the UK for most of the time I have been doing this job. Four men doing the same job have confirmed their salary is higher by up to \\xa310,000. I have no confidence in the BBC review process. I tried asking for equal pay in 2017 and recently heard it is still under review.\"  11\\. Radio 4 reporter \"In 2017 I submitted an equal pay claim after finding out that a male colleague was being paid \\xa37,000 more for doing the same job. I made little progress, so I began a formal grievance. A few days before the hearing I was called in and offered \\xa34,500 extra a year. I was told it was not because they thought I had an equal pay claim, but a reward for hard work. I am considering further action as they refuse to backdate my pay.\"  12\\. National radio presenter \"I have worked alongside my male co-host for six years so far and for all that time have been paid at one third of the rate he is paid. We work broadly the same hours with equal production input into the programme. Pay query raised in autumn 2016, only to be told there was no issue. Pay revised July 2017. Case still subject to negotiation and part of NUJ collective grievance.\"  13\\. National radio presenter \"I used to present a breakfast news programme in BBC local radio. In 2013, Tony Hall set a target to increase the number of women presenting in local stations. Shortly afterwards I was told my job was at risk and then that I could stay, but only on half my previous salary. It was also half of the amount being paid to my then male co-presenter. As the sole breadwinner I eventually had no choice but to leave. I now present on BBC national radio and earn what I believe is less than half of my current male co-presenter's salary for the demanding show we both present.\"  14\\. Presenter regional news \"I am one of two main presenters on a regional TV news programme. I have the same role as my male colleague, contracted to the same number of hours and days per year. I am often called upon to present more demanding programmes, such as election debates, in preference to my male colleague. I have 28 years experience as a journalist. In 2012 I became aware of my male colleague's salary, which was a third more than the figure I had been offered. Despite assurances of a comprehensive pay review, none was forthcoming. There was a point blank refusal to a request for equal pay. Eventually I was given a 5% increase in 2017. I can't see any justification for the pay gap which remains.\" * * *  _Follow us on_[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/) _, on Twitter_[@BBCNewsEnts](https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts) _, or on Instagram at_[bbcnewsents](https://www.instagram.com/BBCNewsEnts/) _.

      "article": "[ Males tend to outnumber females in most parliaments around the world, but not in [Rwanda](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Rwanda.html). Women make up the majority of parliament in this African country.  By most measures, Rwanda is Africa's gender-equality success story for high female representation in politics, education and the workplace.  Rwanda was the first country in the world to have more than half of its government run by women.  Currently, 64 percent of its parliament is female, and it has been ranked the highest country in the world with most women in parliament, as of January 2017.  Jessica Horn, director of programmes, African Women's Development Fund in [Ghana](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ghana.html), says: \"There is a legacy of African women playing significant roles in political leadership, and so it should not be too much of a surprise to see women playing political roles in Rwanda.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/50848420d5ad44eb989dc7bcb9146048_18.jpg)  ---  Memory Pamella Kadau:\\xa0Rwanda sets an example for Africa and the world in terms of women's political participation process     \"It's the number that is significant - and that is the result of mobilising.  \"African feminists have always argued, though, that it is not just quantity - the number of women in parliament - but politics: whether they work for a women's rights and transformative agenda.\"  Horn says, \"On that point, every African parliament needs work. We still don't have full, consistent commitment to prioritising and financing gender equality anywhere. That's why we remain advocates\".  According to the [Global Competitiveness Report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness- report-2017-2018), Rwanda is the best place to be a woman in [Africa](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html) and fourth globally after [Iceland](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Iceland.html), Norway and Finland.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/b56c6fdb486a41f3bb7b05fa68704831_18.jpg)  ---  Ngozi Cole: My hope is to keep continuing to fight for more progress in terms of political participation and more laws that empower women     Rwanda is also a global leader in commitments related to the HeforShe campaign, the global solidarity movement for gender equality, developed by [UN](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html) women and spearheaded by men in support of justice and equality for women.  But just because Rwanda has a female-majority government, does not mean women are better off.  According to the UN, rates of domestic violence are considered high in the country.  Al Jazeera talked to several women across the continent about how Rwanda sets an example for other African countries.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/6b10ea9c6f8f40a5834d723fc539f2e1_18.jpg)  ---  Jessica Horn: We still don't have full, consistent commitment to prioritising and financing gender equality anywhere     Duduzile Nyirongo, a feminist who celebrated International Women's Day in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, on Thursday, told Al Jazeera that Rwanda is an example of gender inclusivity.

      "article": "[ ![Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1670B/production/_99651919_gettyimages-850805364.jpg)Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged millions towards sex-ed and reproductive rights worldwide  Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has established a policy mandating that groups that apply for youth employment grants support abortion rights. The policy has angered religious groups from many faiths as well as drawn ire from American conservatives. Canada Summer Jobs grant applicants must check a box on their forms stating they support human rights, including \"reproductive rights\". Mr Trudeau has dismissed the backlash as a \"kerfuffle\".  What is the controversial policy? A new clause in the grant application for the Canada Summer Jobs programme and the Youth Service Corps demands that applicants check a box that says:    \"My organisation's core mandate respect individual human rights in Canada\\u2026 these include reproductive rights and the rights to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, colour, mental or physical disability or sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.\" The jobs programme funds some 70,000 summer jobs for youths between the ages of 15-30. The clause was added after the government was forced to pay a court settlement to three anti-abortion groups after it denied them funding in 2017.  Is it a surprise? Mr Trudeau has made it no secret that he adamantly supports reproductive rights. When he first became leader of the Liberal Party in 2014, he banned anti- abortion candidates from running for office and insisted that all party members vote in favour of pro-choice.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Former White House staffer Sebastian Gorka is critical of the policy  \"Of course, you're more than allowed to have whatever beliefs you like,\" Mr Trudeau said during a town hall in Hamilton, Ontario last week. \"But when those beliefs lead to actions determined to restrict a woman's right to control her own body, that's where I, and I think we, draw the line as a country. And that's where we stand on that.\"  How has it been received in Canada? Pro-choice groups have applauded the decision, but many religious organisations and anti-abortion groups are outraged. The [Toronto Right to Life Association has already filed suit alleging discrimination, ](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/05/anti- abortion-group-takes-trudeau-government-to-court.html)just months after the government settled with the group for also denying them funding last year. Other religious groups who do not actively campaign against abortion have expressed concern that the policy penalises people for their beliefs. \"It requires an evaluation of employers based not on what they're going to do, but who they are and what they believe,\" says Ray Pennings, the executive vice president for the non-partisan Christian think-tank Cardus.  Why is it making waves in the US? The policy was debated on Fox News' morning programme Fox and Friends, while former White House staffer Sebastian [Gorka called Mr Trudeau \"reprehensible\" on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SebGorka/status/952266075072327681). On Fox and Friends, Jeanne Mancini, who organises the March for Life, said Mr Trudeau was \"out of touch with mainstream America\". \"We've lost over 60 million Americans to abortion. To the prime minister, I would just really want to talk to him,\" she said. But it is not the first time Mr Trudeau has run afoul of US conservatives. In 2017, US President Donald Trump cut funding for groups that provide abortion services, [prompting Mr Trudeau to pledge ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/ca9d6cd3-5c3c-469a-bb35-9a957f0ca5b9) $523m (C$650m; \\xa3376million) towards sex education and reproductive health initiatives around the world on International Women's Day.  ] ",

      "article": "[ For a year now, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been trying to give away her $199,700 salary. , With every government-issued paycheck, which she pledged she would not take, the billionaire cabinet secretary grew more frustrated by ethics rules that restricted her ability to donate to charities in her official capacity. , But this week, after finally getting the go-ahead to donate in her personal capacity, she was able to call four organizations of her choosing to inform them they would evenly split the money: Kids Hope USA, a faith-based organization that connects mentors with schools that Ms. DeVos was long affiliated with, [including as a mentor](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/624 /private-geography/act-one); the Special Olympics, the global sports organization for people with intellectual disabilities; Vision to Learn, a program that provides free eye exams and eyeglasses to students in low-income communities; and Dreams Soar, which supports girls in aviation and science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. , For Ms. DeVos, the protracted effort to give her money away is illustrative of her first year in government: She struggles with bureaucracy. She has met opposition at every turn, but in a wide-ranging interview this week to mark the end of her first year as secretary, she said her agenda had not been derailed. , Ms. DeVos, a philanthropist and longtime supporter of private, parochial and public charter schools, remains unapologetic about the things that have made her a target of criticism. She still believes in parents 9 right to choose alternatives to neighborhood public schools, with publicly funded tuition vouchers if need be. She still believes the federal government should have a limited role in telling any school how to educate its students. , And she believes that what many thought disqualified her for the job 4 her lack of experience with public neighborhood schools, which educate the majority of the nation 9s students 4 has been an asset. ,  cI don 9t know what can 9t be done, Ms. DeVos said. cAnd I come in with fresh eyes around all of these issues, and I think that questioning the way things have been done, and being able to look at things from a different perspective, is a good thing. , Here are five takeaways from a question-and-answer session Ms. DeVos conducted with a group of reporters about her first year in office. , **1\\. She has not given up on expanding school choice.** , Ms. DeVos has reeled in her rhetoric around a national voucher and charter- school initiative, and in recent speeches she has emphasized crethinking the way schools educate students across the board. ,  cI would say it 9s a broadening of the message, Ms. DeVos said. cWhen we talk about the need for innovation in education, it has to happen in every traditional school, it has to happen in every private school, it has to happen in every charter school. , Ms. DeVos called the expansion of 529 plans in the December tax law to cover K-12 expenses a cbig win for private and parochial school choice but agreed with analysts who said that the legislation was limited in its impact, especially for low-income students from families with limited means to save. , She signaled that she had settled for using her platform to champion the cause. ,  cThere hasn 9t been a secretary that has talked about empowering parents and giving them choices before, Ms. DeVos said. cAnd I think that 9s a huge benefit, and frankly a privilege to do 4 to try to be a voice for many parents who don 9t have voices. , **2\\. She is proud and pained by regulatory rollbacks.** , Ms. DeVos said she believed that reducing the department 9s footprint had been csome of the most important work we 9ve done in this first year. But she said that the most significant rollback thus far 4 Title IX guidance issued under President Barack Obama for investigating sexual assaults on campus 4 had been cprobably one of the most heartbreaking parts of this job. ,  cAs a mom and a grandma, I think about my children, and we need to get this right. We need to get it right for all students, and it clearly hasn 9t worked in far too many cases, she said. , Victims and advocates have said that Ms. DeVos 9s rescission of the campus sexual assault guidance, which she replaced with interim guidance that changed the standard of proof for investigations, has had a chilling effect on victims who are reluctant to report assaults. ,  cThat would certainly be the last thing I would desire or want, she said. cI don 9t think that the interim guidance that we provided ultimately does that in any way. , Ms. DeVos said the department was still examining the Obama-era guidance that addressed the disproportionate impact of discipline policies and special education placements on minority students. Civil rights organizations have pointed to Ms. DeVos 9s re-examination of these policies as evidence of her lack of empathy for vulnerable populations. ,  cIt 9s hurtful to me when I 9m criticized for not upholding the rights of students, she said. cFor not caring about students with special needs. Nothing could be further from the truth. , Ms. DeVos remains hard pressed to find an area where she thinks regulation is appropriate, but she identified enforcing civil rights laws and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act as a critical role for the department. , **3\\. She believes she is implementing the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, with fidelity.** , Ms. DeVos has faced criticism over her department 9s approval of state plans for implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington who was a chief architect of the law, said that Ms. DeVos had approved plans that do not account for the achievement of low- performing students, as the law requires. ,  cI 9m only approving plans that comport with the law, Ms. DeVos said. cAnd I 9m encouraging anyone who has been critical of me and/or the department on approval of plans. , Ms. DeVos declined to comment on the quality of specific state plans. ,  cI think, very honestly, there 9s lots of areas for continued improvement and a plan is nothing but a bunch of words on paper, she said. , **4\\. She feels hamstrung by Congress.** , Ms. DeVos 9s frustrations these days are directed at the body that confirmed her only with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. , She said a major source of frustration had been the unfilled positions in her department. Five nominees await Senate confirmation, including her would-be deputy and [the nominee to ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics /kenneth-marcus-civil-rights-israel-bds.html)[head the department 9s office for civil rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics /kenneth-marcus-civil-rights-israel-bds.html). ,  cWe have many qualified, capable individuals waiting to come and contribute here and they 9re just messing around up on that building on the hill, Ms. DeVos said. , Ms. DeVos also expressed frustration with how much Congress controls the budget, which she said was an example of chow Washington doesn 9t work. It is also in the Constitution. ,  cIf we were given a top-line number and were able to designate by our own priorities around line items, it would probably look somewhat different than what the budget looks like, Ms. DeVos said. , **5\\. She plans to push experiential and personalized learning in K-12 and higher education this year.** , Ms. DeVos has already begun stumping for initiatives that would give students different pathways to the work force, a mission President Trump has thrown his weight behind in calling for more [ cvocational schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-vocational- education.html). , Ms. DeVos said too many students were being steered toward a traditional college degree. , \"I think personalized learning, competency, mastery, that 9s a big shift from where education has been, she said. cBut it 9s absolutely where most of education has to go. ] ",

Cold Shoulder This cold shoulder bothers gun enthusiasts in Springfield, 90 miles west of Boston and 140 miles north of New York City. Just outside the city limits, Walter Lamon sells guns at Culverine Firearms, where photos of soldiers adorn a store packed with boxes of Smith & Wesson revolvers. His business, like Smith & Wesson 9s, boomed under President Barack Obama because of fears of gun confiscation and fell under National Rifle Association booster [Donald Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1252249 \"Billionaire Profile\") (Shares of American Outdoor Brands have lost almost two-thirds of their value since the 2016 presidential election.)\\xa0 Lamon, 70, loathes Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat who tightened the state 9s assault weapons ban. A photo of Healey, with a hand-drawn Hitler mustache, hangs on a wall. cHeil Healey, it reads. In Massachusetts cthe gun industry and people like me are vilified, Lamon said. cThat 9s because the majority of folks have a more liberal bent.  Awkward Dates For almost a decade, David Upton, 34, managed orders for Smith & Wesson. Even in romance, he experienced the gun divide. When he was dating, some women recoiled in horror at his employer, while others would ask if he could take them shooting.  cThe joke when I was there is that we can 9t sell 90 percent of the guns we make to people who live in the state, he said. Upton, who now works at a craft brewer, said his old job has since moved to gun-friendly Missouri. In fact, Massachusetts may be losing its status as a gun leader, as manufacturers ship operations to the South and Southwest, according to Jurgen Brauer, Small Arms Analytics 9 chief economist.  cIncreasingly, these kinds of companies feel they 9re in a little bit of a foreign land culturally, Brauer said. Employees bristle at being cconstantly affronted by anti-gun sentiment when they go to church or the grocery store.  War Laboratory Springfield 9s firearms focus dates to the Revolutionary War, when George Washington selected the city for the nation 9s first armory, which functioned as a U.S. Army gun factory for almost two centuries. There, inventors transformed the muzzle-loading rifle of the Civil War era into modern breech-loading weapons and then World War II 9s signature M1 Garand rifle. For the Vietnam War, the armory was the site of testing for the M16 rifle, the military version of the AR-15. A half mile away, the Springfield Museums offer visitors the Smith & Wesson [Gallery of Firearms History](https://springfieldmuseums.org/about/museum-of- springfield-history/smith-wesson-gallery-of-firearms-history/ \"Gallery Details\"). Sponsored by the company, it features 1890s pistols engraved by Tiffany jewelers and a prized nickel-plated. .357 magnum.  cFOR MECHANICAL SKILL, STRENGTH, ACCURACY AND PENETRATION THEY ARE UNEXCELLED, reads an early Smith & Wesson add featuring a man in a cowboy hat and handle-bar mustache.  Dr. Seuss But\\xa0Karen Fisk, the museum 9s marketing director, says few tourists visit that gallery; they flock instead to the new museum honoring Springfield native and author Dr. Seuss. Bud Williams, a former school teacher and probation officer, focuses less on the history of guns and more on their impact today. As a state representative, his district includes Smith & Wesson. More often than he likes, he finds himself comforting the families of gunshot victims in a city whose violent crime rate rivals Chicago 9s. (Michael R.

To take guns off the streets, Williams, a Democrat, is planning a buyback program. In 2013 and 2016, such efforts netted hundreds of guns that were later destroyed -- though a handful of the most valuable are stored at Springfield 9s famed armory, now a museum run by the National Park Service. In other words, Springfield celebrates, manufactures, sells -- and destroys -- guns.  ] ",

      "article": "[   Last Updated Mar 27, 2018 11:27 AM EDT   Of the issues that divide Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and President Donald Trump's incomin[g national security adviser, John Bolton,](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-john-bolton-the-new-national- security-adviser/) one stands out: North Korea. Bolton, who will replace Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on April 9, has publicly advocated for overthrowing the North Korean government. Mattis, a retired Marine general who knows intimately the costs of war, favors diplomacy to rid the North of its nuclear weapons and has said war on the Korean peninsula would be \"catastrophic.\" On Iran, too, Mattis would seem at odds [with Bolton, who has argued for abandoning the Obama-era nuclear deal.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jimmy-carter-trump-john-bolton-national- security-adviser-worst-mistake/) These and other matters of war and peace will test Mattis' influence with Mr. Trump as his national security team is overhauled. On Thursday, Mattis told reporters that while he had not yet met Bolton, he was confident in a \"partnership\" developing between the two men.\\xa0 \"He's going to come over this week.\\xa0 Last time I checked he's an American. I can work with an American...It's going to be a partnership,\" Mattis said.\\xa0 Mattis was sometimes at odds with McMaster, but the arrival of the hawkish Bolton, combined with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the uncertain status of John Kelly as White House chief of staff, appears to leave Mattis more isolated than at any time since he took over the Pentagon 15 months ago. Often described as a steadying or moderating influence on the impulsive Mr. Trump, Mattis has little previous relationship with Bolton. The North Korea issue is front-and-center: Mr. Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean President Kim Jong Un by May to discuss the North's nuclear disarmament. The unprecedented summit could be a turning point in a decades- old U.S.-North Korean standoff that Mr. Trump himself has said could end in \"fire and fury\" - an American nuclear attack __ to stop the North from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile. \"This is buckle-up time,\" retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said last week on MSNBC. \"For the military I have three words: Sharpen your swords. He (Bolton) is someone who is going to reach for the military instrument.\" The changes in the White House and at the State Department, while significant for Mattis, are hardly heart-stopping. People close to him sense no change in his commitment to the job; some suggest that Mr. Trump's decision to move former Republican congressman and current CIA director Mike Pompeo to State, replacing Tillerson, could benefit Mattis in the sense that he'll have a partner at State who is better aligned with Mr. Trump. Publicly, Mattis has said little about the shakeup. He was in Afghanistan when Tillerson got the ax. When reporters asked his reaction a couple of days later, Mattis said he preferred not to comment on the details, although he went on to suggest that its importance was being exaggerated. He said that in all of his discussions abroad with foreign government officials and American troops, the matter was not brought up once. \"I understand why you're asking, but I'm just pointing out that in most parts of the world this is a Washington, D.C. story,\" he said. Another Washington story is Mattis and his ability to forge a workable relationship with Mr. Trump despite differences on some issues like the Iran nuclear deal, which Mattis says is flawed but worth honoring as long as the Iranians do. Mattis also has differed with the president over Mr. Trump's wish to bar all transgender people from serving in the military, and he helped sway Mr. Trump from his [inclination last year to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-james-mattis-we-are- not-quitting-this-fight/) The Mattis formula seems to be simple. Out of the spotlight, out of trouble. The less he says publicly, the less he risks losing influence with Mr. Trump. \"Part of his success ... is absolutely the fact that you don't see him in the limelight terribly much,\" says Loren Dejonge Schulman, a defense analyst at the Center for a New American Security who served in key national security positions in the White House and Pentagon under President Barack Obama. \"That may be keeping him out of trouble with the White House but I think it's setting an incredibly bad precedent in terms of Pentagon transparency.\" If Mattis, who spent more than 40 years in uniform and is the first career military officer to lead the Pentagon since George C. Marshall in the early 1950s, isn't the most experienced politician to run the military's vast bureaucracy, he has shown a knack for staying out of trouble with his thin- skinned boss. Mattis has even broken Mr. Trump of his habit of calling the retired general \"Mad Dog,\" which Mattis insists was a media invention to begin with. Mr. Trump frequently has lunch and dinners with the defense secretary and speaks glowingly of him to outside advisers. White House officials have said that Mr. Trump sometimes repeats military historical anecdotes he heard from Mattis. Even Mattis' few known stumbles have not dogged him. In August, for example, Mattis told sailors at a submarine base in his home state of Washington that the Navy would give them the worst and the best days of their lives, and then added, \"That means you're not some (expletive) sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. \"You know what I mean, kind of sitting there saying, 'Well, I should have done something with my life.'\" His language was quickly forgotten. The episode pointed to a man who has shaped the job and not let it shape him. So much so that perhaps the most poignant criticism of his tenure has been the secrecy with which the military has handled everything from troop deployment numbers to the details of its military strategies 4 things that often were made public under previous secretaries.  ] ",

      "article": "[ In the wake of the school shooting that killed 17, President Trump and the National Rifle Association's main proposal to prevent another tragedy like the one in Parkland, Fla., has been to arm teachers. NRA chief Wayne La Pierre told a crowd at a conservative gathering that cour banks, our airports, our NBA games ... are all more protected than our children at school.  cHighly trained, gun-adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive, the president tweeted\\xa0Thursday. But that\\xa0desire has led some Americans, especially those who discuss race and politics, to raise questions: Will we be arming all teachers, including black teachers or education professionals who teach in mostly minority districts? It's a worthwhile question, given the police killings of [unarmed black men in recent years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national /police-shootings-2017/). It's another layer to the conversation about how racialized the debate around gun violence can be.\\xa0There has not been a mass shooting in a predominantly minority high school that compares to the shooting at\\xa0Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a [school of mostly white students in\\xa0a\\xa0fairly affluent suburb.](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/florida/districts/broward-county-public-schools/marjory-stoneman- douglas-high-school-4749)\\xa0But some activists have pointed out that there are some students who face gun violence in their community on an almost daily basis.  cAnother tragic moment. But there are folks in communities that I know who have been burying their kids for a long time\\xa0because guns have been in their communities. Parents have been grieving because they've been putting their babies in [the] ground, d\\xa0Eddie S. Glaude, a Princeton University religion and African American studies professor, told MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on Thursday. Glaude added that it took ccertain kinds of people to die for us to get this question on the table. When it comes to arming teachers and the factor race might play, two issues are being raised: (1) Arming teachers of black students who may have a racial bias, and (2)\\xa0arming black teachers and education workers, who face their own risks carrying a weapon. The Internet was quick to remind us that Philando Castile, a cafeteria supervisor at a public school in St. Paul, Minn., was shot dead by a police officer after he told him he was carrying a licensed firearm. Efforts to tackle\\xa0school violence have\\xa0disproportionately impacted black\\xa0students through arrests and restraint, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Although black\\xa0students were only 16 percent of the total student enrollment during the 2011-12 school year, they made up 27 percent of the students referred to law enforcement and nearly double 4 31 percent 4 of the students involved in a school-related arrest,\\xa0[according to data from the U.S. Department of Education\\xa0office for civil rights](http://ocrdata.ed.gov/Downloads/CRDC-School-Discipline- Snapshot.pdf). Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for late-night show cFull Frontal with Samantha Bee, mentioned\\xa0how\\xa0carrying a gun could have added to her already-tense relationship\\xa0with a racist teacher.  cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun? Yeah, there are more good, kind, teachers ... but they're not gonna be the ones signing up for guns, d\\xa0Black [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ashleyn1cole/status/966452714573041665). Kelly Wickham Hurst, CEO of Being Black at School, a nonprofit that addresses issues impacting black students,\\xa0[asked](https://medium.com/@kellywickham /on-protests-arming-teachers-and-what-schools-really-need-535f69d55de4): cHow long before a teacher feels the need to make use of Stand Your Ground while on a school campus? Multiple [studies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/09/27 /yale-study-suggests-racial-bias-among-preschool- teachers/?utm_term=.cf96c2551280), including one from the Yale University Child Study Center,\\xa0have shown that implicit bias against black students shapes how teachers respond to them. That's not to imply explicitly that white teachers will be using guns against black students, but it does factor into how students of color are disciplined.  cImplicit biases do not begin with black men and police. They begin with black preschoolers and their teachers, if not earlier. Implicit bias is like the wind: You can 9t see it, but you can sure see its effects, d\\xa0Yale child psychology professor Walter S. Gilliam previously told The Post. Bree Newsome, an activist who attracted national attention after a mass shooting in a Charleston, S.C., church, argued that the idea that arming teachers with guns will protect youths doesn't seem to take black youths into account. > Whenever politicians talk about giving more guns to people as a solution to gun violence, you can rest assured they aren't talking about Black people b/c we are shot & killed by police for holding BB guns, wallets, cell phones or nothing at all > > 4 Bree Newsome (@BreeNewsome) [February 22, 2018](https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/966523139504164864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Michael Harriot, host of the podcast cThe Black One, [wrote](https://www.theroot.com/theres-a-theory-that-black-people-buying-guns- could-sto-1823167744?utm_source=theroot_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow) that the idea of black\\xa0educators carrying guns isn't likely to attract lasting support because history has shown that conservatives do not support gun ownership among black Americans as much as they claim.  cIf black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation, he wrote for\\xa0the Root. cWhile no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America 9s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won 9t work. Nearly 6 in 10 4 59 percent 4\\xa0think America would be less safe if more people had guns, according to a recent\\xa0Quinnipiac\\xa0[poll](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release- detail?ReleaseID=2521). And only\\xa020 percent say armed teachers are the answer to making schools safer. More than half of Americans do not think the Parkland shooting could have been prevented had teachers been armed, according to a Washington Post-ABC [poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/20/most- republicans-think-arming-teachers-could-have-prevented-parkland-new-gun-laws- couldnt/?utm_term=.1920ecd7c5c7). The school did have an armed school resource officer assigned to protect students, but he reportedly took a defensive position outside the school and did not enter the building\\xa0during the shooting. The sample size for how black people feel on this issue was too small to break out. But\\xa0the current conversation about school safety appears to have more black Americans drawing attention to the consequences arming teachers could have in schools where implicit biases exist, particularly against black students who are deemed threatening. ] ",

But it comes in many forms -- it is not a one size fits all system. In Wakanda, culture and traditions were important. The Wakandans followed them while evolving their country. They did not simply accept a new form of government because it worked for other societies. Africa has seen charismatic leaders elected democratically and celebrated by the West only for those leaders to change the rules to fit them. Democracy can be manipulated. We saw that recently in Rwanda, and in Uganda for years. Wakanda seems to embrace and exhibit some of the basic tenets of democracy while respecting their culture and tradition. For example, while there were no elections, certain citizens could challenge the king to win the throne. This was their form of election and it was valued and respected. While we modernize and develop our society, we should remember the positive traditions and cultures that got us here and preserve them as we modernize. This is a firm lesson for African leaders.  **Embrace the natural habitat of the land while developing and building up.** In Wakandan architecture, we saw red dirt and market places while alongside super railways and skyscrapers.

There were about [1,000 more permanent exclusions in the year 2015-16](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/permanent-and-fixed-period- exclusions-in-england-2015-to-2016) (6,685 exclusions in all) than there were the year before, according to government statistics. That's out of a total of the roughly 8 million children attending state schools in England. It works out as eight in every 10,000 primary and secondary school pupils, up from seven in every 10,000 the previous year. It's something the government says it's going to look at, in a review led by former children's minister Edward Timpson. But what do we already know about who gets excluded? Certain groups of children, and children in certain parts of the country, are much more likely than average to be expelled from school.     Special educational needs Almost half of all exclusions - either permanent or for a fixed period of time - are of pupils with identified special educational needs. Children with special educational needs are seven times more likely than the average to be permanently excluded, although this proportion has actually slightly fallen as the total number of exclusions has risen. Special educational needs cover a wide range of difficulties and disabilities, which makes learning harder for these children than for other pupils of a similar age. By far the most common reason given for permanently expelling a child is \"persistent disruptive behaviour\". Other less common reasons include physical and verbal abuse, bullying, racist or sexually inappropriate behaviour and drug and alcohol use. This isn't the whole story, though. The official statistics only capture formal exclusions. But there are concerns that some children are being \"managed out\" of schools in less formal ways.    Exclusions in numbers   * More than a quarter of permanent exclusions were pupils aged 14 - those just about to start their GCSE courses   * Boys were more than three times as likely as girls to be permanently excluded   * Pupils claiming free school meals - available to households on lower incomes - were about four times as likely to be excluded   * Pupils receiving support for special educational needs were the most likely to be excluded (seven times as often as those without special educational needs)   * Black Caribbean pupils were over three times more likely to be permanently excluded than the average   * Children in the West Midlands are twice as likely to be excluded (12 in every 10,000) as children in the South East of England (six in every 10,000)  _Source: Department for Education_    'Informally' excluded A [report by centre-left think tank IPPR](https://www.ippr.org/files/2017-10 /making-the-difference-report-october-2017.pdf), published in October, found the total number of children being taught in \"alternative provision\" for excluded children is far higher than the total number of reported exclusions. When children are excluded from mainstream or special schools they often end up in a pupil referral unit or an independent or non-registered school. Part of the gap identified by the IPPR is thought to be down to children who were informally excluded and so don't appear in the exclusion statistics, but do appear in the census of children in alternative provision. Another part of the explanation may be children staying in alternative provision for more than a year - so in subsequent years they appear in the alternative provision data but not in that year's tally of exclusions.   * [What is it like to be excluded from school?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-37563774)   * [Half of children expelled from school 'mentally ill'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40667089)  But pupil referral units were not designed to be permanent settings for children to complete their compulsory education. They were designed to refer them on to another mainstream or a special school. Kiran Gill, one of the authors of the IPPR report and founder of charity [The Difference](https://www.the-difference.com/), says: \"Increasing numbers of children are being referred close to their exams and end up doing their exams in pupil referral units.\" She says only 1% of GCSE candidates in pupil referral units leave with the five good GCSEs they would need to continue with their education (A*-C under the old system or grades 4-9 under incoming GCSE reforms). Last January, more than two-thirds of all pupils in alternative provision were in Years 10 and 11 - their GCSE years. School inspectorate Ofsted has raised concerns that schools are removing children from their rolls as they approach GCSE as a way of \"gaming the system\" in performance tables. There also appears to be a group of children who are being repeatedly, informally sent home from school due to difficult behaviour without ever being permanently, formally excluded, according to Catriona Moore, an education policy expert at the National Autistic Society. These children miss out on large parts of their schooling without showing up in the exclusions statistics, she says. Of a survey of 2,573 parents conducted by the charity, one in four said their child had been \"informally\" excluded at least once in the last year. Malcolm Trobe, of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says schools also have to consider the other children in a classroom. \"If you have a child whose behaviour is extremely disruptive and it's impacting the education of 28 other children in the class, you may have to take some serious action,\" he says. He adds that funding pressures have meant schools are less able to access external support like counselling, behavioural management and mental health services for young people and in some cases, \"the only way to access this external support for a child is to have them excluded\". Launching the government's external review of school exclusions, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: \"Children only get one chance at their education and they deserve the best. But for too many children - and often those who are most vulnerable - there are inconsistencies when it comes to their experiences of school and too many parents are left worried and concerned. \"That's not good enough which is why we are going to improve our understanding of these important issues and tackle them head on.\"    [Read more from Reality Check](http://www.bbc.co.uk/realitycheck) [Send us your questions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747) [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbcrealitycheck)   ] ",

(Matt Rourke/AP) Come\\xa0 July 1, Philadelphia will regain control of its public school system for the first time since it was taken over by the state in 2001. The district has been controlled by\\xa0the state-appointed School Reform Commission, which was nothing if not controversial. It implemented unpopular creform plans that included closing schools, opening and supporting charter schools with little or no accountability, evaluating teachers by student standardized test scores, and a cdoomsday budget that zeroed out funding for things such as paper, counselors, and art and music programs. The reform commission recently voted to dissolve 4 at the request of Mayor James Kenney (D) and to the delight of parents and activists who been working toward a return to local control for years. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) and state Education Secretary Pedro Rivera agreed to the plan late in December, and local\\xa0control will return this summer. Now Kenney is forming a nine-member appointed school board, a structure that city voters had previously approved. As Philadelphia residents prepare to take back their school district, they may want to consider some advice from one of the country 9s most distinguished education researchers. Below is a letter from David Berliner, Regents 9 Professor Emeritus at Arizona State University, with some thoughts about what they\\xa0probably will be able to accomplish and what they can 9t do 4 lessons that transcend the specifics of Philadelphia. It was written to education scholar and public school advocate Diane Ravitch and [posted on her blog](https://dianeravitch.net/2017/12/21/david-berliner-offers-advice-to-the- citizens-of-philadelphia-about-their-public-schools/). (She and Berliner gave me permission to publish it.) Some of the letter is technical, but the details are important to understand this observation of his: > \\u2026[T]he good citizens of Philadelphia will probably not find whatever important things teachers might be accomplishing in their classrooms reflected in the standardized test scores routinely used in Pennsylvania.

Since then, I 9ve been mulling over four things that I wish I could communicate to them. Perhaps you can do so if you think it appropriate. I don 9t know the folks there. > > First, it will be difficult for teachers to show that they can turn Philadelphia 9s schools into higher-achieving institutions. Teachers may help their students become stronger and more engaged learners, but they probably won 9t be able to demonstrate student learning in the way that most people understand it, namely, through higher standardized achievement test scores. > > The education research community clearly knows what politicians and the media don 9t fully grasp: teachers simply don 9t account for much of the variance in standardized tests scores. A reasonable estimate is that teachers account for about 10 percent of the variance in standardized achievement test scores. Research also suggests that outside-of-school factors account for 6 times more of that variance! We even have a Philadelphia based study corroborating these estimates. > > In a 2014 Educational Researcher article by Fantuzzo, LeBoeuf, & Rouse, 10,000 achievement test scores from Philadelphia were examined. The researchers used two sets of variables as predictors of students 9 standardized test scores. The first set were school-level demographic variables such as race, gender, and degree of economic disadvantage. These are the kind of variables that the Coleman Report first revealed as strong influences on standardized achievement test scores. > > My own research, and that of many others, has repeatedly confirmed this truth. In Fantuzzo et al. these kinds of variables predicted 63 percent of the between school variance, quite close to the usual estimate of 60 percent of variance accounted for by demographic variables in students 9 achievement test scores. Their data, then, are similar to what was found across nations in PISA and PIRLs, and similar to what other researchers find when school-level demographic variables are put into regression equations to predict variance accounted for. > > But what Fantuzzo et al. also did was add student-level variables to their equations. For each student, they knew whether the child was pre-term or low birth weight, had inadequate prenatal care, had a mother who was a teen, had high lead exposure, had a report record of being maltreated, had ever been homeless, and had a mother with less than a high school degree. It wasn 9t surprising that each of these variables was a negative predictor of achievement test scores, and similarly, it wasn 9t surprising that all but one variable was a statistically significant predictor of the standardized achievement test scores. > > When the conventionally used school-level demographic variables were combined with student-level variables into the same equation, something quite different was revealed. The between school variance in reading test scores increased from 63 percent to 77 percent of the variance accounted for in the students 9 standardized test scores. This leaves us with the task of trying to estimate what accounts for the remaining 23 percent of the variance in these standardized achievement test scores. We can separate that remaining variance into variance accounted for by error in the measurement system (a reasonable estimate might be about 10 percent) and school effects that are independent of teacher effects (which may also reasonably be estimated to be about 10 percent). Now we can account for about 97% of the variance. So, what percent of the variance in student test scores remains for teachers to affect? The answer is clearly almost nothing! > > This all suggests that the good citizens of Philadelphia will probably not find whatever important things teachers might be accomplishing in their classrooms reflected in the standardized test scores routinely used in Pennsylvania. Instead, they should now think about other credible ways to judge teacher effectiveness. > > Second, it won 9t be Philadelphia 9s newly taken-over schools that demonstrate how to get greater achievement from the students they serve. Schools, like teachers, may also be doing great things. But as noted, they usually affect about 10 percent of the variance on standardized achievement tests. Given Philadelphia 9s high poverty rates, the variables associated with poverty may well account for most of the variance in citywide test scores, leaving little variance for the schools to effect, similar to the teacher effects just discussed. > > The third point addresses the obvious question, what then should we do to better understand how teachers and schools effect local student outcomes? Usually we measure this via a standardized achievement test score, but as noted, that is quite likely not to be adequate for those purposes. > > Instead, let 9s try something different, and use the funds ordinarily paid to a test publisher to train selected parents who, alongside school principals or teacher leaders, could routinely observe classrooms and assist in monitoring the quality of instruction. Parents, principals, and teacher leaders can better learn to evaluate the artifacts of teaching, among them teachers 9 tests and students 9 answers. Those classroom tests will show both teachers 9 understanding of and instructional alignment with the desired curriculum (as evidenced in the test 9s items). And those tests will also show the quality of teaching that curriculum (as evidenced in the students answers to the items). > > These assessments can be conducted as informal observations, or can use some of the of the more systematic and frequently used observation scales, such as those found in Danielson 9s and Pianta 9s systems. Scriven 9s duties-based evaluation approach is certainly worth trying. And Meier 9s and Knoester 9s recent book offers a half a dozen other ways to assess students and classroom practices that don 9t rely on standardized achievement tests. The point is this: assessing the quality of teachers and schools can be done without using standardized achievement tests that are known to be highly insensitive to what teachers and schools accomplish. > > My fourth bit of advice is directed at those who serve on the newly constituted school board. It 9s to remember that education outcomes are the result of much more than education polices. The school board will not achieve their improvement targets until other city and state policies better address the needs of Philadelphia 9s schoolchildren. Housing policies must be strengthened to eliminate segregation by race and income, and affordable housing is needed to minimize residential mobility, which impedes school achievement. Physical and behavioral health policies must be strengthened, and nurses, counselors, and social workers must be sufficiently resourced to ensure that students attend school daily and have the supports needed to fully engage in learning. Policies to assure food security are needed so students aren 9t preoccupied with hunger, and fair wage policies can provide income security for working families overwhelmed by living in poverty. And so on. > > Getting their schools back is good for democracy in the city that played center stage in the founding of our nation 9s democracy. Getting those schools to function well enough so its students can take on the role of stewards of our democracy is a whole other matter. I hope this advice helps them to do just that. > > David Berliner **_(Correction: Fixing spelling of John Fantuzzo)_** ] ",

And yet their fate is rarely discussed in the context of Iran 9s freedom movement. This will hopefully change soon. Earlier this month, the Baha 9i International Community established a new internet archive of official documents, news articles, audio recordings and other primary sources that document Iran 9s decades-long campaign against followers of the religion. State-sponsored discrimination against the Baha 9i was a feature of the Iranian government under Shah Reza Pahlavi. But the persecution intensified under the Islamic Republic that unseated him in 1979. [One letter from the archive](https://iranbahaipersecution.bic.org/archive/request-water- connection-kayhan-zarei-rejected) shows how a Baha 9i citizen 9s property was denied a connection to fresh water supply because of his faith. Others show lenient sentences meted out for Iranians convicted of heinous crimes against Baha 9i citizens.        A particularly damning document in the new archive is a Feb. 25, 1991, [secret directive](https://iranbahaipersecution.bic.org/archive/supreme-revolutionary- cultural-councils-secret-memo-dealing-bahais) from the current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. He writes that as a general policy the Baha 9i will not be arrested, exiled or imprisoned without reason. Nonetheless, cThe government 9s dealings with them must be in such a way that their progress and development are blocked. He then lays out what that means. For example, he says Baha 9i citizens can be enrolled in schools, so long as they do not self-identify as Baha 9i. Universities must not let in Baha 9i citizens, or must expel such students once their religious beliefs become known. He ominously writes, cA plan must be devised to confront and destroy their cultural roots outside the country. Khamenei says they may be permitted to obtain work permits, rations cards and passports, cso long as it does not encourage them to be Baha 9is. But no high-status positions should be given to Baha 9i citizens, even if they remain in the closet. cDeny them any position of influence, such as in the educational sector, etc., he writes. That was more than 25 years ago, but the new archives show that they remain second-class citizens. [A 2013 letter](https://iranbahaipersecution.bic.org/archive/manouher-baghdadi-not- entitled-salary-and-pension) for example to Manouher Baghdadi says he is not eligible to receive his pension because cthe individual is a follower of the perverse sect of Baha 9ism. It 9s almost impossible to know how many Baha 9i live in Iran today. The regime disbanded the Baha 9i official governing council in 1983. Iran 9s census does not bother to count them. The Baha 9i International Community estimates that there are 300,000 Baha 9i in Iran.     James Samimi Farr, a media officer for Baha 9is of the United States, said the new archives was established this month to respond to crising international interest to understand the situation for Baha 9is of Iran. That timing also coincides with the latest uprisings against a regime that has enriched elites and further strangled the political freedoms of its average citizens. Let 9s hope this movement ends the rule of the current clerics and terror masters. But that alone will not be enough. Iran 9s next leaders must also end the state-sponsored discrimination against the Baha 9i and make amends for the century of persecution authored by both the shahs and the mullahs.

Research finds that when students change schools they're more likely to be less engaged, which could lower their grades and increase the risk they will drop out of high school. Students generally lose about three months of reading and math with each transfer. A promising new program for low-income students and their families at an Atlanta school has cut the student turnover rate by nearly half. * * * When Nicole Evans Jones became principal at Thomasville Heights Elementary School two years ago, she inherited a crisis.

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg) New Mexico 9s education chief is being blasted\\xa0for linking the growth of charter schools to the controversial 19th-century idea of American expansion known as Manifest Destiny. Even after he apologized to American Indian leaders, criticism of his remarks has persisted. At a conference in December, Education Secretary-designate Christopher Ruszkowski said\\xa0school choice, which is championed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is cquintessentially American.  cThis is a country built over the last 250 years on things like freedom, choice, competition, options, going west, Manifest Destiny 4 these are the fundamental principles of this country, he was[ reported as saying by the Albuquerque Journal](https://www.abqjournal.com/1104504/ped-chief- school-choice-is-quintessentially-american.html). cThat 9s why charter schools make so much sense 4 high-quality options 4 in the context of where we are as a country. He also rejected suggestions from Democrats and progressive educators that the United States should look to other countries with successful education systems 4\\xa0such as high-achieving Finland 4 for ideas to reform the American public school systems. cI hate to put it this bluntly, but this isn 9t Finland, he said. cYou can 9t redesign as if we were Finland. Too late. This country wasn 9t built that way. Leaders of American Indian nations said they were cappalled and deeply offended by the reference to Manifest Destiny, and said the remarks lacked cany sensitivity, understanding and appreciation of the atrocious impacts of Manifest Destiny upon generations of our people. Manifest Destiny\\xa0describes the notion that the United States was destined by God to dominate North America. The United States grew through territorial expansion in the first part of the 1800s, but that expansion also sparked a war with Mexico, expanded slavery and led to the systematic relocation and brutalization\\xa0of Native Americans and other occupants of lands\\xa0seized by the U.S. government.\\xa0American Indians continued to struggle against\\xa0U.S. government policies in the 20th century. Ruszkowski 4 who is a designee because he has not been confirmed by the state legislature 4 reached out to every tribal leader in the state, according to a spokesman for the New Mexico Public Education Department, to express remorse for the cpoorly phrased historical reference and to clarify that portion of his speech. He also met with several tribal leaders and the vice president of the Navajo Nation, the spokesman said. Ruszkowski himself said in a statement: > cI reject any doctrine, past or present, that stands in the way of making excellent schools a reality for all of our children, and stand alongside all of New Mexico 9s children, families, educators, and tribal leaders who are fighting for schools that are both higher performing academically and more culturally and linguistically responsive.\\xa0We must continue to partner and collaborate on behalf of our children. Criticism started\\xa0shortly after the remarks appeared in the media.\\xa0E. Paul Torres, chairman of the\\xa0All Pueblo Council of Governors, wrote [an op- ed in the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/opinion/my_view/the-legacy-of- manifest-destiny-trauma-and-suffering/article_1a6e980c-41ff-50bc- bee4-40836ad18ddf.html) that said in part: > cThe All Pueblo Council of Governors consists of the 19 sovereign Pueblo Nations of New Mexico, with the 20th Pueblo nation, Ysleta del Sur, in Texas. We are the oldest political organization in the country, dating back to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. We are the primary and official advocacy organization representing the Pueblo Nations on all matters locally and at the state and federal levels. > > cWe are appalled and deeply offended by the recent statements at a charter school conference by Public Education Department Secretary-designate Christopher Ruszkowski regarding Manifest Destiny as the continuing core value of this nation and the state that drives the education agenda. This is utterly disgraceful, lacking any sensitivity, understanding and appreciation of the atrocious impacts of Manifest Destiny upon generations of our people. The principles of Manifest Destiny have inflicted multigenerational trauma. That is the legacy of Manifest Destiny in our history. The comments should be evaluated in context, according to Regis Pecos, co- director of the Leadership Institute based at the Santa Fe Indian School in New Mexico, which was established in 1997 to foster discourse on public policy and tribal community issues facing the 22 tribal nations in New Mexico.  cIf these are deeply embedded values [of Ruszkowski], then it is unfortunate that he is the secretary of the Public Education Department in a place where you have surviving sovereign nations who were the victims of this very doctrine that he makes reference to as the very foundation of the principles that made America great, d\\xa0Pecos said.\\xa0Pecos served as\\xa0lieutenant governor and governor of the Tribal Council at Cochiti Pueblo, was executive director of the New Mexico Office of Indian Affairs for 16 years and was chief of staff to the New Mexico speaker of the house as well as a trustee of Princeton University. He said such statements to American Indians are cwhat the Holocaust is to the Jews and what cslavery is to our African American brothers and sisters. Anpao Duta Flying Earth, head of School at the Native American Community Academy,\\xa0[wrote a response on the website](http://leadership- pdc.org/articles/an-educators-response-to-the-secretarys-comments-on-manifest- destiny/) of the Center for Student Leadership in Albuquerque that said in part: > cMy grandmother first told me about Manifest Destiny in the context of genocide and brutal colonization of our ancestors. European colonizers used the idea of Manifest Destiny based in a righteous divine purpose to validate the killing, raping, and theft of indigenous land and ideas. She would often emphasize that though Manifest Destiny began hundreds of years ago, it is still alive in peoples 9 ideas today. It is the cause for a corrupt notion of property rights that disregards the inherent rights and responsibilities that indigenous people have to the land. Manifest Destiny has led to the paternalistic treatment of tribes by the federal government articulated in policy and de facto treatment of indigenous people that sends a message of 8we know what 9s best for you 9 and in fact 8it 9s our divine right to control you and your land base. 9 > > cBecause of my knowledge and personal experience with the idea of Manifest Destiny, I was shocked to hear it referenced in a speech by the New Mexico secretary of education as a positive baseline theory in our education systems. Everyone in the education field, especially the New Mexico secretary of education, has the responsibility to learn about the local context and culture of the people, if for nothing else than to better understand the thousands of children and families who are affected by their leadership. What message is proliferated by the validation of Manifest Destiny as quintessentially American? > > cI understand that the intentions of these comments are based in the support of high-quality charter schools. However, there is no context that validates the use of this term in relation to progress without disregarding the brutal reality of what happened in this country 9s history under the auspice of Manifest Destiny. We need to demand accountability of individuals who carelessly use terms that buttress domination and supremacy of one group over another. Accountability is necessary when considering that the individual who made these remarks is responsible for the leadership of an entire state 9s education system. ] ",

Mr Serre said he has no problem with the customer complaining to the human rights commission, but he does not think the promotion is discriminatory.    \"It's his right. If he feels wronged, then I applaud him for taking it to the (commission). But I think he's taking it the wrong way,\" Mr Serre told the CBC. \"As a general rule of life, women should get paid equally. I think that's important. Is it worth my 13 per cent on a Monday night?

In 2013, another London, Ontario, establishment faced a human rights complaint because it offered women a 50% discount on cover on its \"ladies' night\".

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is making the announcement at a global conference in Senegal, as part of a new emphasis on targeting aid at education projects. Ms Mordaunt said supporting schools in poorer countries was a \"hard-headed\" investment in a more prosperous future. But aid agencies warned the amounts promised were still insufficient. Ms Mordaunt is promising \\xa3225m funding over three years at a global education conference in Dakar, hosted by France's President Emmanuel Macron and Senegal's President Macky Sall.     Building schools This event will see international leaders pledging funds for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), which works with developing countries on raising education standards in some of the poorest parts of the world. Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and now chair of the GPE, said that by \"increasing by 50% its commitment\" the UK would give \"millions of children an opportunity to go to school\". The UK government has faced accusations of either giving too much or too little in overseas aid. Backbench critics have called for a reduction in aid budgets when public services are under pressure at home. While aid agencies have called for the UK to show stronger leadership with more support for developing countries. The UK's previous contribution to this global education fund has been \\xa352m per year and will now offer up to \\xa375m per year - with the GPE a high- profile part of the UK's support for overseas education. But some aid agencies questioned whether such a full amount would be delivered, as this will be conditional on the level of contributions from other countries. If these other contributions from donors are not sufficient, as has happened previously, aid agencies warn that there will be no significant increase in the level of UK funding. Ms Mordaunt says that the UK wants to help prevent the \"terrible waste of potential\" when \"half the world's children leave primary school unable to read or write\".

A report from the committee said that at present about 7% of UK aid was spent on education.

But the committee chairman Stephen Twigg said he was \"very disappointed\" that the amount pledged by the UK was much less than recommended by the committee. He highlighted that the conditions attached to the amount promised could mean no real increase is delivered. Kate Osamor, Labour's shadow international development secretary, said: \"While it may sound like a lot of money, this is a deeply dispiriting announcement from the government\". She said that the amount promised would leave the GPE without enough funding was \"surrendering Britain's reputation as a global leader\". Aid campaigners have called for a bigger increase in financial support from the UK to match the scale of the challenge. The One campaign, which works to reduce poverty in Africa, says that this pledge is less generous than the previous funding round in 2014, when \\xa3300m was promised over four years. But this was conditional on levels of funding from other donor countries - and when this was not forthcoming the amount given by the UK was about \\xa350m per year. Romilly Greenhil of the One campaign said: \"A higher pledge would have given the UK a golden opportunity to demonstrate global leadership on education and use our expertise to promote quality education for all - an opportunity that now risks being lost.\" This week figures from Unicef showed that almost a third of young people living in countries affected by conflict, mostly in Africa, were illiterate.  ] ",

The program seeks to dignify the critical role of teachers in a democratic society by promoting professional preparation that is rich in the arts, humanities and ethnic studies. **By Stephen Mucher** In the aftermath of the Feb. 14 shooting deaths of 17 people at a South Florida high school, some political leaders are saying that similar tragedies could be prevented by deputizing, training and arming teachers. Advocates for broader conceal-and-carry laws in schools argue that a more vigilant educator workforce would prove both a deterrent and a defense against the inevitable threat posed by psychologically troubled teens. As a teacher who has spent a career working alongside fellow educators in urban and rural areas alike, I 9m concerned about that strategy. I join many other educators who worry that weaponizing teachers would further militarize learning environments, increase the risk of deadly accidents, and offer little protection against a determined student with a military-grade assault rifle. This debate, which was only recently relegated to the margins of our political discourse, is likely to grow louder with each successive school shooting. President Trump spoke Wednesday to survivors of the Feb. 14 attack at Florida 9s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a 19-year-old firing a semiautomatic weapon, making his National Rifle Association-endorsed position clear. cIf you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, Trump said, cthey could very well end the attack very quickly. I 9ll let others, particularly public-health professionals, assess the president 9s case. What I 9m most concerned about now is what an armed teaching workforce would do to my profession. What type of individual would choose or reject a teaching career in the future under such conditions? How does the presumption of an armed faculty reshape the relationship between teachers and students? And for students who must increasingly learn how to challenge authority, what ideas get stifled when their teacher holsters a 9mm Glock on his or her waistband? These questions are critical at a time when many of our democratic institutions face unprecedented challenge. Our gun debates reflect national politics characterized by predictable patterns of inaction, distrust, incivility and ideological entrenchment. Any long-term solution to this democratic crisis will require a generation of youths prepared to discover what their parents and grandparents found so elusive. They will need to find courageous empathy with others, reconcile historical injustices and identify common ground across intractable ethnic, religious, economic and geographic differences. These students will need teachers who can initiate and model democratic practices sadly missing from our nation 9s capital to the statehouse. Such practices require patience and courageous nonviolence. We will need the more than 3 million working teachers who are vigilant, deputized, trained and armed with the knowledge and skill needed to bring their students together. Today 9s teachers can tap into a noble legacy. Our greatest educators have long helped students bridge the gap between an unjust, violent society and the more inclusive possibilities of democracy. The 19th-century schoolmaster, for example, encouraged pupils see beyond a harsh frontier and imagine more humane civic institutions. Enslaved men and women organized clandestine classrooms on the plantation, passing the literacy of liberation on to their children. Ethnic minority teachers, representing over a century of American immigration, helped students transcend criminalizing stereotypes and recognize their academic potential. And LGBTQ teachers provided comfort and hope in communities where students knew that exposure could lead to greater exclusion and violence. When I talk to my teaching colleagues, I still hear this idealism. In these historic examples, we recognize educators who put students first, typically ahead of their own personal safety. Many of us feel called to this work. Our family and friends often describe us, in our passion, as strangely ccut out for an impossible profession. We laughingly kid each other that teachers care a little too much. Given this professional history, the fact that educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas stood between a deadly threat and their own students should be less surprising. Scott Beigel, Aaron Feis and Chris Hixon join teachers who paid our profession 9s highest price at Columbine High School in Colorado, Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and too many other schools where mass shootings have occurred. Countless others are returning to traumatized students with resolve. One Parkland teacher spoke for many of us when he said, cI would take a bullet for the kids. This resolute hopefulness remains central to the ethos of the profession we chose. Each day we choose to see in each student the better angels of their nature. Our vocation is built on this continuous act of trust. Without this trust, initiated with courage, the learning relationships we seek are impossible. Without this trust, there is no democracy for us to keep. Upholding these values does not make us naive. Ask any veteran teacher and you will hear stories about students with dispositions now painfully familiar in the profile of too many school shooters. Few of us honestly think, cIt won 9t happen here. After all, we protect our students each day from classmates who are either momentarily or routinely mean-spirited. We also know that obtaining a gun is easier for our students than returning the parental permission forms required for field trips or sporting events. We know colleagues who are drawn to the enforcement side of education, and, admittedly, some small number of these individuals have a role to play in schools. But the widespread arming of teachers could skew our workforce profoundly. Individuals who are inclined toward caring, instructive relational work could be driven away from this militarized environment. Individuals inclined toward authoritarian interactions could increasingly decide that schools best reward their desire to exercise power. Testimonials from\\xa0[one of the more celebrated organizations](http://fastersaveslives.org/) promoting and training armed teachers illustrate concerns about changing the central mission of our profession. I am a different person after this training, one school employee explains. A third-grade teacher describes the new cmental preparation emerging from her course. Another educator states, cI am changed thanks to this training. As educators, we have no reason to doubt these testimonials. But many of us love our profession far too much to want this kind of change. ] ",

      "article": "[ SCIENCE fiction is littered with examples of intelligent computers, from HAL 9000 in c2001: A Space Odyssey to Eddie in cThe Hitchhiker 9s Guide to the Galaxy d. One thing such fictional machines have in common is a tendency to go wrong, to the detriment of the characters in the story. HAL murders most of the crew of a mission to Jupiter. Eddie obsesses about trivia, and thus puts the spacecraft he is in charge of in danger of destruction. In both cases, an attempt to build something useful and helpful has created a monster. Successful science fiction necessarily plays on real hopes and fears. In the 1960s and 1970s, when HAL and Eddie were dreamed up, attempts to create artificial intelligence (AI) were floundering, so both hope and fear were hypothetical. But that has changed. The invention of deep learning, a technique which uses special computer programs called neural networks to churn through large volumes of data looking for and remembering patterns, means that technology which gives a good impression of being intelligent is spreading rapidly. Applications range from speech-to-text transcription to detecting early signs of blindness. AI now runs quality control in factories and cooling systems in data centres. Governments hope to employ it to recognise terrorist propaganda sites and remove them from the web. And it is central to attempts to develop self-driving vehicles. Of the ten most valuable quoted companies in the world, seven say they have plans to put deep-learning-based AI at the heart of their operations.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

It certainly lacks the apparently conscious motivation of the sci-fi stuff. But it does turn both hope and fear into matters for the present day, rather than an indeterminate future. And many worry that even today 9s cAI- lite has the capacity to morph into a monster. The fear is not so much of devices that stop obeying instructions and instead follow their own agenda, but rather of something that does what it is told (or, at least, attempts to do so), but does it in a way that is incomprehensible. The reason for this fear is that deep-learning programs do their learning by rearranging their digital innards in response to patterns they spot in the data they are digesting. Specifically, they emulate the way neuroscientists think that real brains learn things, by changing within themselves the strengths of the connections between bits of computer code that are designed to behave like neurons. This means that even the designer of a neural network cannot know, once that network has been trained, exactly how it is doing what it does. Permitting such agents to run critical infrastructure or to make medical decisions therefore means trusting people 9s lives to pieces of equipment whose operation no one truly understands. If, however, AI agents could somehow explain why they did what they did, trust would increase and those agents would become more useful. And if things were to go wrong, an agent 9s own explanation of its actions would make the subsequent inquiry far easier. Even as they acted up, both HAL and Eddie were able to explain their actions. Indeed, this was a crucial part of the plots of the stories they featured in. At a simpler level, such powers of self- explanation are something software engineers would like to emulate in real AI. Open the box One of the first formal research programs to attempt to crack open the AI cblack box is the Explainable AI (XAI) project, which is being run by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an organisation that does much of America 9s military research. In particular, America 9s armed forces would like to use AI to help with reconnaissance. Dave Gunning, XAI 9s head, observes that monitoring places like North Korea from on high, by spy plane or satellite, creates a huge amount of data. Analysts looking at these data would certainly value something that alerted them automatically to suspicious activity. It would, though, also be valuable if such an agent could explain its decisions, so that the person being alerted was able to spot and ignore the inevitable false positives. Mr Gunning says that analysts from one of America 9s spy agencies, the NSA, are already overwhelmed by the recommendations of old-fashioned pattern-recognition software pressing them to examine certain pieces of information. As AI adds to that deluge, it is more important than ever that computer programs should be able to explain why they are calling something to a human operator 9s attention. How the NSA is responding to this is, understandably, a secret. But civilian programmes are also trying to give neural networks the power to explain themselves by communicating their internal states in ways that human beings can comprehend. Trevor Darrell 9s AI research group at the University of California, Berkeley, for example, has been working with software trained to recognise different species of birds in photographs. Instead of merely identifying, say, a Western Grebe, the software also explains that it thinks the image in question shows a Western Grebe because the bird in it has a long white neck, a pointy yellow beak and red eyes. The program does this by drawing on the assistance of a second neural network which has been trained to match the internal features of the agent doing the recognising (ie, the pattern of connections between its cneurons d) with sentences that people have written, describing what they see in a picture being examined. So, as one AI system learns to classify birds, the other learns simultaneously to classify the behaviour of the first system, in order to explain how that system has reached its decisions. A team led by Mark Riedl at the Georgia Institute of Technology has employed a similar technique to encourage a game-playing AI to explain its moves. The team asked people to narrate their own experiences of playing an arcade game called Frogger. They then trained an AI agent to match these narratives to the internal features of a second agent that had already learned to play Frogger. The result is a system which provides snippets of human language that describe the way the second agent is playing the game. Such ways of opening the black box of AI work up to a point. But they can go only as far as a human being can, since they are, in essence, aping human explanations. Because people can understand the intricacies of pictures of birds and arcade video games, and put them into words, so can machines that copy human methods. But the energy supply of a large data centre or the state of someone 9s health are far harder for a human being to analyse and describe. AI already outperforms people at such tasks, so human explanations are not available to act as models. ![](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print- edition/20180217_STD002_0.jpg) Fortunately, other ways exist to examine and understand an AI 9s output. Anupam Datta, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, for instance, is not attempting to peer inside the black box directly, in the ways that Dr Darrell and Dr Riedl are. Rather, he is trying to do so obliquely, by cstress-testing the outputs of trained systems 4for example, those assessing job candidates. Dr Datta feeds the system under test a range of input data and examines its output for dodgy, potentially harmful or discriminatory results. He gives the example of a removals firm that uses an automated system to hire new employees. The system might take a candidate 9s age, sex, weightlifting ability, marital status and education, as described in the application, as its inputs, and churn out a score which indicates how likely that candidate is to be a good employee. Clearly one of these pieces of information, the ability to lift heavy things, is both pertinent and likely to favour male candidates. So in this case, to test the system for bias against females, Dr Datta 9s program alters randomly selected applications from women to make them appear to be from men and, separately, swaps the weightlifting abilities of female applicants 4again, at random 4with that of applicants from both sexes. If the randomisation of sex produces no change in the number of women offered jobs by the AI, but randomising weightlifting ability increases it (because some women now appear to have cmale dabilities to lift weights), then it is clear that weightlifting ability itself, not an applicant 9s sex, is affecting the hiring process. Dr Datta 9s approach does not get to the heart of how and why agents are making decisions, but, like stress testing an aircraft, it helps stop undesirable outcomes. It lets those who make and operate AI ensure they are basing decisions on the right inputs, and not harmful spurious correlations. And there are other ways still of trying to peer into machines 9 minds. Some engineers, for example, are turning to techniques, such as cognitive psychology, that human beings use to understand their own minds. They argue that, since artificial neural networks are supposed to work like brains, it makes sense to employ the tools of human psychology to investigate them. One example of such an approach is research by DeepMind, an AI firm in London that is owned by Google 9s parent company, Alphabet. This has yielded an intriguing insight into the behaviour of a piece of image-matching software the company has designed. A group of DeepMind 9s engineers, led by David Barrett, showed the software sets of three images. The first of each set was a cprobe image of a certain shape and colour. Of the other two, one matched the probe in shape and the second matched it in colour. By measuring how often the system chose the shape match as opposed to the colour match, Dr Barrett and his team were able to deduce that DeepMind 9s image matcher equates images in the way that people do 4that is, according to shape rather than colour. Elucidating in this way the broader principles of how a particular AI makes decisions might be useful when preparing it for deployment in the world. It might also help accident investigators, by directing them towards the most likely sorts of explanation for a failure. Those inclined to try to crack open the cminds behind AI thus have many ways of doing so. Some people, however, think this whole approach wrongheaded. They observe that those decisions made by AI which are hardest to scrutinise are necessarily the most complex and thus likely to be the most useful. Easy-to-parse tasks, like playing video games and naming birds, are of limited value. Decisions made while balancing an electrical grid or managing a city 9s traffic flow are harder to explain, especially as many of them are taken at levels beyond human processing capabilities. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, calls this kind of processing artificial intuition. Dr Bengio says such artificial intuition was on display during the most public demonstration of deep-learning that has ever taken place. This was a Go match held in 2016 between an AI agent and Lee Sedol, the world 9s greatest human player. The agent in question, AlphaGo, was trained by DeepMind. It sometimes made unexpected moves that human experts could not explain. At first those moves appeared to be errors. But AlphaGo then used the surprising position thus generated to dominate the rest of the match. Intriguingly, moves like these are also sometimes made by human Go masters. They are known in Japanese as _kami no itte_ ( cthe hand of God d, or cdivine moves d). As the name suggests, a player who feels a move is divinely directed in this way usually cannot say how or why he placed a certain stone where he did. Indeed, the fact that players cannot explain the reasoning behind their best moves offers a hint as to why old-style Go-playing computers, based on formal logic, were never any good. Neural learning systems, both those that have evolved in brains and those now being put into computers, can handle the task of playing Go. But human language cannot describe it. Pandora 9s box? There is, though, a crucial difference between the explanations that humans offer up for their own behaviour, and those available from machines. As Dan Sperber, a cognitive scientist at the Jean Nicod Institute, in Paris, observes, people tend to construct reasons for their behaviour which align with information mutually available to speaker and listener, and with their own interests, rather than describing accurately how their thoughts led to a decision. As he puts it, cthe reason to give reasons is so that others will evaluate your actions and beliefs d. Today 9s autonomous machines do not have their own interests to serve. Instead, their explanations are forged by and for human beings. Some speculate that this may change in the future, if AI is developed which, like the fictional variety, seems to have motives of its own, rather than merely acting at human whim. Jacob Turner, a specialist in international law, suggests ascribing legal personhood to AI will then be necessary if those harmed by such advanced agents are to seek compensation and justice. ![](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print- edition/20180217_STD003_0.jpg) That is probably a long way off. But even today 9s AI may raise ticklish legal questions. In particular, machine minds that cannot explain themselves, or whose detailed operation is beyond the realm of human language, pose a problem for criminal law. As Rebecca Williams, a legal scholar at Oxford University, observes, if machines lack the ability to explain their actions, current law might struggle to identify criminal intent in acts that arise because of decisions they have made. cIn criminal law, she says, cthe thing that 9s interesting is having the third party breaking the chain of causation that is not a human being. That is really new. This is not a matter of AI agents themselves acting in a criminal manner in the way Mr Turner speculates might one day happen. But if the process by which a machine made a decision cannot be subject to cross-examination, because neither the machine nor its creator is able to explain what went on, then deciding the guilt or innocence of a human being associated with that decision may be impossible. For example, if a neural network that authorises loans cannot explain why it gives certain people certain scores that seem biased against one social group or another, it may be impossible to determine whether its operators had arranged this intentionally (which would be an offence in most jurisdictions), or whether lazy coding by its designers had led to accidental bias (which would probably be a matter for the civil courts rather than the criminal ones). Similarly, if the AI that ran the visual systems of a driverless taxi were a black box that could not be interrogated about its choices, it might be hard to know whether a death caused by that car was the fault of the manufacturer or of the firm responsible for maintaining the vehicle. The world is still a few years from the moment a case involving a driverless car might come before the courts. A case of social bias, however, is eminently conceivable even now. It does not require the imaginations of Arthur C. Clarke or Douglas Adams, the inventors, respectively, of HAL and Eddie, to envisage the advantages of software that can not only act, but also explain the reasons behind its actions.

Well in Trump's 2018 Black History Month proclamation, the president chose to highlight the contributions of one particular group of black Americans: veterans. The president [wrote](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions /president-donald-j-trump-proclaims-february-2018-national-african-american- history-month/): \"This annual observance is an opportunity to remember the challenges of our past, but also to honor countless African-American heroes who inspire us to shape our country 9s future.\\xa0 This year 9s theme, 'African Americans in Times of War,' calls our attention to the heroic contributions of African Americans during our Nation 9s military conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to present-day operations.\" The president proceeds to highlight the contributions of black veterans to America and\\xa0seems to imply that racism in the military as something that was a significant problem more than half a century ago, saying: \"It was not until 1948 that President Harry S. Truman ordered desegregation of the military, providing 'equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Forces without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.'\\xa0 It took another 5 years before the Secretary of Defense abolished the last segregated African-American military unit.\" The history of racism in the U.S. military goes back to before the United States was established, with black people\\xa0defending a country that didn't protect them.

Just last year,\\xa0Protect Our Defenders, a nonprofit that deals with harassment and abuse in the military, produced a report about ongoing racial discrimination in the military. The report [read](https://www.protectourdefenders.com/disparity/): > \"Military leadership has been aware of significant racial disparity in its justice process for years, and has made no apparent effort to find the cause of the disparity or remedy it. The leadership has vigorously opposed any suggestion that the commander-controlled justice system is hindered by conflicts of interest or bias and has gone to great lengths to tout the fairness of the system. However, the military 9s own data raises serious challenges to the idea that the system in its current form is capable of delivering impartial justice.\" And following the riots in Charlottesville, where white supremacists sought to protect memorials honoring Confederate generals that are largely seen as symbols of racial hatred, Washington Post military reporter Dan Lamothe [wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/08/18/after- charlottesville-the-u-s-military-grapples-with-its-history-of-racism-and- extremism/?utm_term=.a19274aa037e)\\xa0about\\xa0top military officials' concern about some service members and veterans joining right-wing extremist or white- supremacist groups, or acting out their ideologies. Trump was correct to note that blacks have been key figures in\\xa0the military since before the founding of America. But the way Trump spoke about the black American experience in the military honors the patriotism of black Americans in the military without addressing their ongoing challenges with racial discrimination.

Martin Luther King Jr. was pushing hard on a full-employment agenda.\\xa0 (AP) One wants to always be careful not to over interpret any jobs report 4 the numbers are noisy in the monthly data. But when a number pops out that makes sense in terms of both theory and empirical evidence, it 9s legitimate to take note. In this spirit, note that the African American unemployment rate hit 6.8 percent last month, the lowest on record, with data going back to the early 1970s. In addition, the gap between black and white unemployment, measured as the black rate minus the white rate, hit 3.1 percentage points, also the lowest on record. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3bGe0uZzLfkclUZImDmVLvuqZ28=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OLQAXHYXHUY6HMRC2MDVOMFGVA.png)  Source: BLS Now, you may well be saying, cWait up; 6.8 percent doesn 9t sound all that low, especially given that the overall jobless rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. I agree. Where is it written that minority rates must be multiples of white rates? Some of the difference is due to educational differences, but not as much as you might think. Similar differentials in black/white jobless rates exist for all education levels. Racial discrimination is, of course, alive and well and in play in these gaps. But that key observation underscores my larger point:\\xa0A persistently strong macroeconomy is highly potent medicine for treating economic inequities, including racial ones. It 9s not all that 9s needed, by a very long shot. Purging discrimination and unequal punishment from the criminal justice, for example, is essential if we 9re ever to achieve racial justice. But it 9s not a coincidence that toward the end of his life, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was pushing hard on a full-employment agenda. The economics is straightforward. Discrimination 4 which doesn 9t have to be only racial discrimination; employers might discriminate against workers who 9ve, for example, been unemployed for a long time or have been out of the job market 4 is a cluxury that employers who engage in it can 9t afford when the economy tightens up. You either hire someone you might avoid if the labor supply queue was a lot longer, or you leave profits on the table. So, while we shouldn 9t get too excited about that relatively low monthly rate 4 given the high statistical variance in these data, it could jump back up next month 4 we should recognize and applaud these critical important macro-dynamics and the clear trends they 9re delivering, as seen in the figure above. In fact, rigorous [research](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017071pap.pdf) by Federal Reserve economists shows that black unemployment, along with the black/white gap is highly cyclical, meaning that what we 9re seeing here is what we 9d expect in year nine of an economic expansion with a labor market closing in on full employment. What about wage growth? In fact, not everything is totally rosy in the current job market. While wages are rising a bit faster than prices, their growth rate hasn 9t accelerated much at all, even as the job market has tightened up. I 9ve been observing and measuring this relationship for a long time, and I 9d expect to see more than we 9re getting on the wage side. The wage data for African American workers lags the job market data, so I can 9t speak to the racial wage story in real time. But I can share some hopeful indirect evidence. Using data on real (inflation-adjusted) median hourly wages for black workers, I asked how does the wage respond with the black-white unemployment gap closes. For every point of closure, the real black median wage goes up about a percent. That 9s not huge, but it 9s a move in the right direction. And the combination of more work at even slightly higher pay will raise black incomes and lower black poverty. Again, hold the applause: The strong macroeconomy is helping to achieve but a small piece of racial economic justice. These wage and job gaps remain far too large, and the opportunities facing black families, from kids to adults, are still much too constrained. But the policy implication is crystal clear: The longer this expansion proceeds, the better chance minority workers have of claiming some of its benefits. For the Federal Reserve, soon under the new leadership of Chair Jerome Powell, the message is this: Especially given that inflation remains tame and well below the Fed 9s target, keep your hands off that punch bowl! ] ",

      "article": "[   **WASHINGTON --** Years of steady hiring and economic growth have delivered a cumulative benefit for at least one group that hasn't always shared in America's prosperity. The [unemployment rate](https://www.cbsnews.com/news /economy-adds-modest-148000-jobs-in-december/) for African-Americans fell to 6.8 percent in December, the lowest level since the government began tracking such data in 1972.\\xa0 The reasons range from a greater number of black Americans with college degrees to a growing need for employers in a tight job market to widen the pool of people they hire from. \"The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News!\" President Donald Trump said in [a tweet](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-himself-a-very-stable-genius- slams-michael-wolff/) Saturday.\\xa0  > The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8%, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And, in the Washington Post (of all places), headline states, cTrumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good. > > 4 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [January 6, 2018](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949608746497576960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)   Still, the rate for black workers remains well above those for whites and some other groups, something experts attribute in large part to decades of discrimination and disadvantages. Robust job creation has lowered unemployment for all Americans. U.S. employers added nearly 2.1 million jobs in 2017 -- the seventh straight year that hiring has topped 2 million. The U.S. economy gained a hefty 5.7 million jobs in 2014 and 2015 alone. But there are also less-happy reasons for the lower unemployment rates: Fewer Americans are either working or looking for work. (People who aren't actively seeking a job aren't counted as unemployed.) An aging population means there are more retirees. Young Americans are also staying in school longer before job-hunting. \\xa0 And some people, perhaps discouraged about their prospects, have given up looking for work and so aren't included in the unemployment rate. Here are some questions and answers about African-Americans' record-low unemployment rate:  Q. Given the record-low unemployment rates, if this the best job market ever for blacks?\\xa0 A. Not necessarily. As with nearly all demographic groups, a smaller proportion of blacks have jobs now than before the Great Recession, in part because of retirements, more people staying in school and discouraged would-be workers.\\xa0 The best job market for African-Americans might actually have been in 2000, when 61.4 percent of black adults were employed, the highest proportion ever. That figure fell below 52 percent in the depths of the recession, and is now 57.9 percent. The same pattern occurred for other groups. Two-thirds of Latinos were employed in 2000; now, only 62.5 percent are. About 65 percent of whites were working in 2000, far higher than the current 60.4 percent. (The data for Asians goes back only to 2003.)  Q. Why is the African-American unemployment rate higher than the rate for whites?   A. The main reason is discrimination, according to most research. Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy, notes that even when African-Americans have similar levels of education or experience, their chances of being unemployed are higher. \"That's what begs the question of what else could be the major reason,\" Wilson said. Nancy DiTomaso, a business professor at Rutgers University, says her research has found that whites likely benefit from networks of family and friends that don't intentionally exclude blacks or other minorities. Yet, nevertheless, their networks have the effect of helping whites get jobs more readily than blacks.  Q. What about other ethnic and racial groups?   A. Everyone is benefiting from the healthy job market. The unemployment rate for Latinos was 4.9 percent in December, just above the record low of 4.8 percent reached in June. And the jobless rate for Asians was 2.5 percent in December, just above the record low of 2.4 percent set in 2006.  Q. What factors have helped lower unemployment for African-Americans?   A. One major reason, Wilson says, is that many more black Americans are college graduates than in the past. That doesn't completely offset the effects of discrimination. But among all groups, college graduates have lower unemployment rates than those with less education. Another driver is economic: When the national unemployment rate falls to ultra-low levels, employers typically cast wider nets to find the workers they need. As they do so, they typically start pulling in more people from historically disadvantaged groups. These include job-seekers with less education as well as racial minorities. With the current U.S. unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, that appears to be what's happening. Some economists want the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising the short-term interest rate it controls for exactly this reason: Raising that rate could slow growth just as the benefits of the economy's expansion are spreading to disadvantaged groups.  Q. Where might the unemployment rate for African-Americans go from here?   A. It depends on the economy. Most economists expect healthy growth this year, fueled in part by the Trump administration's tax cuts for individuals and companies. That should lower unemployment for all Americans. The African-American unemployment rate is highly volatile and could rise or fall noticeably in the months ahead. It's down from 7.9 percent a year ago. Typically, the African-American unemployment rate is about twice the rate for whites and is more volatile. Wilson calculates that for each percentage-point change in the rate for whites, up or down, the rate for African-Americans will swing by about 1.6 points.\\xa0  ] ",

      "article": "[ WASHINGTON 4 After spending much of her life fighting for state and local control of education, Betsy DeVos last year found herself at the helm of the federal agency that she had long said stands in the way of educational innovation. , But after a year on the job, Ms. DeVos may have learned a hard lesson: local control means she can 9t always get what she wants. , Ms. DeVos this week upbraided state education chiefs, telling them that while she was obligated to approve their federally mandated state education plans, she was not happy about the way they have used their freedom under the new federal law that governs elementary and secondary education, known as the Every Student Succeeds Act. , If the states are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, Ms. DeVos isn 9t seeing much experimentation. But she refuses to violate her principles on states 9 rights and tell them what to do. ,  cESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs 4 including many in this room 4 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state 9s unique challenges, Ms. DeVos said in an address to the Council of Chief State School Officers. cWell, this law gives you that chance. The trouble, I don 9t see much evidence that you 9ve yet seized it. , It was the first time that Ms. DeVos has offered her opinions on the quality of state plans under the new law, which freed states from the punitive and prescriptive federal mandates of the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind Act. , But what Ms. DeVos called ctough love policy experts and observers called the ultimate display of a frustrated federalist. The address, they said, is an example of a self-described education reformer wrestling with the limits of her influence in an agency whose power she wants to curtail. ,  cI think she 9s having an identity problem, said Sandy Kress, who served as senior education adviser to Mr. Bush on the No Child Left Behind Act. , Mr. Kress noted that Ms. DeVos had been critical of her predecessors, calling Mr. Bush 9s education law a cstick, and Barack Obama 9s Race to the Top policy, which incentivized state reform with cash, a ccarrot. But he noted that she had not identified any tool that she would use to effect change in the nation 9s schools. ,  cBeing a federalist does not exclude you from the role of leadership, Mr. Kress said. cShe needs to stand for something, rather than showing up at a place like a regular citizen opining on things. , Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said he believed that not since the administration of the elder George Bush has an education secretary been a true federalist. That education secretary was Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is now a senator. As the chief architect of ESSA, he ensured the clocal control components of the bill. , George W. Bush 9s administration was so aggressive in driving education policy that Mr. Bush reset the expectation of conservative leadership in the department, Mr. Petrilli said. ,  cWe 9ve been conditioned for the last 30 years to expect a secretary of education to be out front on education reform, using various federal levers, he said. cBetsy DeVos is trying to lead from behind. , Ms. DeVos 9s criticism of the state plans echoed that of several groups that say her office 9s implementation of ESSA has been too lax. , Democrats and civil rights groups say Ms. DeVos has approved state education plans that do not properly measure the performance of minority students, an allegation she denies. But in her speech, she mentioned the fact that [several governors](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/us/politics/betsy-devos- education-reform-governors-essa.html), the majority of them Republican, had refused to sign the plans their states submitted to her office because of what they saw as lackluster achievement goals. ,  cJust because a plan complies with the law doesn 9t mean it does what 9s best for students, Ms. DeVos told the chiefs. cWhatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won 9t pass muster around kitchen tables. , Education chiefs bristled at Ms. DeVos 9s assessments, which they saw as painting them with too broad a brush. ,  cAll states are doing far more than Sec. DeVos recognized, tweeted Matthew Blomstedt, the education commissioner in Nebraska, a state whose [governor refused](http://understandingessa.org/nes-governor-says-he-wont- sign-states-essa-plan/) to sign its ESSA plan. cShe delivered a 8tough love 9 speech that demonstrated why the USDOE is out of touch with the good things actually happening in states and schools. , Policy experts agreed with the substance of the speech, but said it was too little, too late. ,  cShe should look in the mirror, said Chad Aldeman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners, a consulting firm that led a group of policy experts in an [independent review of plans last year.](https://bellwethereducation.org/publication/independent-review-essa- state-plans) cThere were several points in time she could have shared her concerns and improved plans. , All plans have been submitted, and 35 have been approved. In announcing the batches of approvals, Ms. DeVos noted only that they complied with the law. , Ms. DeVos had signaled unwavering support for the autonomy under the ESSA law, and even issued a pared-down template for states to complete following a [vote by Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/every-student-succeeds-act- essa-congress.html) last year to rescind regulations that specified accountability measures in the law. But since then, she has not used much of her power over budgets, guidance documents or even a public relations campaign to promote opportunities for innovation and specificity under ESSA, critics say. ,  cShe lowered the bar, they met it, and now she seems frustrated by that, Mr. Aldeman said. , Ms. DeVos told state chiefs that they met the lowest bar 4 compliance 4 and that many plans fell short of furthering ESSA 9s primary goals of innovation in educational programming to lift student achievement, as well as increasing transparency about school performance. , For example, she said, only two states, Louisiana and New Mexico, opted into a program that allowed them to use millions in otherwise restricted federal dollars to provide new educational programs, like online courses, for struggling schools. , She also said that some states cproposed accountability schemes that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one. In one case, she said, a state ctook a simple concept like a color-coded dashboard and managed to make it nearly indecipherable. , In her speech, Ms. DeVos praised cbright spots, like Nevada, whose state education chief, Steve Canavero, said he was encouraged by the speech. ,  cThe core message I heard is a message that I continue to hear from the other folks who are in the bleachers of the education space: You have to continually think about ways to innovate, and think about ways to best serve kids, Mr. Canavero said. , Ms. DeVos reiterated that she would not fall into cthe trap of a top-down approach of her predecessors. ,  cThe Department of Education doesn 9t write laws, it implements them, she said. cCongress did its job. We 9re doing ours. And now, you get to do yours. ] ",

(Ghaith Abdul Ahad/Getty Images) NEW DELHI 4 In India, the rich and poor inhabit vastly different worlds. Now, many fear, new government rules will deepen that divide with \\xa0different-colored passports. On Friday, India 9s Foreign Ministry issued new rules saying that citizens who require emigration checks will now carry orange passports, while those who don 9t will carry blue ones. The new orange passports are supposed to protect vulnerable\\xa0laborers from exploitation abroad, but critics argue that the orange and blue color coding could lead to discrimination against poor and illiterate workers and effectively render millions of Indians second-class citizens. India is the world 9s largest exporter of migrant labor; [1 in 20](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/03/india-is-a-top-source-and- destination-for-worlds-migrants/) migrant workers worldwide are Indian-born 4 a number that has rapidly risen in the past 25 years. Indian \\xe9migr\\xe9s sent home $69 billion in 2015, making their country the world 9s top recipient of remittances. But many of those who travel, especially those who provide cheap, unskilled labor, are very vulnerable to exploitation. In the past few years, scandals involving the Indian diaspora in Persian Gulf countries have shaken citizens. In 2016, [Reuters reported](http://news.trust.org/item/20160503123246-dtg1p/) that 55-year-old Kasthuri Munirathinam, who worked as a housemaid in Saudi Arabia, became the face of migrant tragedy in the gulf after she described how her employer chopped her arm off in a fight that ended with her having to crawl out a second-floor apartment window. Saudi police at the time [said](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/saudi-police-try-to-shift- blame-on-indian-maid/article7771306.ece)\\xa0that Munirathinam 9s arm was amputated\\xa0because of\\xa0a fall and that she was\\xa0mentally ill. In Qatar, figures from the Indian Embassy in Doha showed that more than\\xa0[500 Indians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/qatar- world-cup-india-migrant-worker-deaths) died between 2012 and 2014. Human rights groups [said](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27 /thousands-qatar-world-cup-workers-life-threatening-heat)\\xa0construction workers had been subjected to squalid living conditions and were working in intense heat and humidity in preparation for soccer's 2022 World Cup. To protect workers, India requires unskilled migrants to get clearances from the Indian government before traveling to a number of countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Malaysia and Yemen. But people who have graduated high school, or the 2\\xa0percent of Indians who pay income tax, don 9t need to get clearances for travel, as skilled or educated\\xa0workers are less likely to be exploited abroad. Those who need emigration checks are identified on the last page of their passport. The new passport design, the Foreign Ministry said, would do away with the last page and instead use the colored covers to differentiate so that it will make it easier for immigration and law enforcement officers to spot travelers who require vetting before they travel to certain countries. The theory is this would also make human trafficking more difficult as border officials would immediately know which people need the extra permission to travel. India is one of the world's most unequal societies. Oxfam's India chief executive in 2017 said that just [57 billionaires control 70 percent](https://www.oxfamindia.org/newsclipping/1777) of the nation's wealth. Critics said the entire system of emigration clearance reinforces the divide between rich and poor. Nitin Pai, director of a Bangalore-based public policy think tank, criticized the new rules.  cHowever well-intentioned the move to create different colored passports for different kinds of travelers, it is wrong and must be reconsidered. Already officials treat citizens differently based on their class\\xa0\\u2026 different passport colors will worsen it, he wrote on Twitter. Oomen Chandy, former chief minister of the southern state of Kerala, said, cIf this becomes a reality, the moment an orange color passport holder lands in a foreign country, he will be treated with disdain, and it will have a telling impact on such people's character and individuality. This should not happen at all. **Read more:** [Is India neglecting the Taj Mahal because it was built by Muslims?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/is-india-neglecting-its-iconic- taj-mahal-because-it-was-built-by-muslims/2017/10/03/61bd142e-fd2a-408f-b56b- b58916f0b290_story.html?utm_term=.36ac28aff85c) [Officials turn to 8public shaming 9 to get people to use 52 million new toilets in India](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india- turns-to-public-shaming-to-get-people-to-use-its-52million-new- toilets/2017/11/03/882166fe-b41c- 11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html?utm_term=.9855667d53eb) [What are India 9s anti-Romeo squads?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/22/yogi- adityanath-the-extremist-leader-in-india-launches-anti-romeo-squads-to- protect-women-is-it-moral-policing/?tid=a_mcntx&utm_term=.9b77300b42c3) ] ",

Specialist staffing levels have dropped by 14% over seven years, despite a 31% rise in the number of children requiring support, says the Consortium for Research in Deaf Education (CRIDE). Almost 60% of existing specialist staff are due to retire within 15 years. Ministers say an extra \\xa3223m is being spent on special needs education. But the National Deaf Children's Society says there has been a \"dereliction of duty\".    Its CEO, Susan Daniels, urged the government to act: \"The evidence couldn't be clearer. From every angle and at every turn, a whole generation of deaf children will have their futures decimated if the Government doesn't act before it's too late.\" She added that despite deafness not being a learning disability, deaf children often fell \"a whole grade behind their hearing friends at school\".  * [Welsh deaf pupils 'underachieve' at key stages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39895438) The CRIDE survey of almost every authority in England found that more than a quarter of services employed one specialist teacher for every 80 students. In some areas there is one specialist teacher for every 100 students. The figures also revealed that a third of councils are struggling to recruit new specialist teaching staff.  Funding gap Responding to the CRIDE report, the Local Government Association warned that there had to be \"additional funding\" from the government to ensure councils meet their legal requirements towards students with additional needs. Last year, the LGA estimated that the [shortfall in children's services budgets would reach \\xa32bn by 2020](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-39849120). [State schools are expected to face a funding gap by the same year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-39292344) according to Education Policy Institute analysis. Cllr Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: \"The recent Provisional Local Government Finance Settlement provided no new money for these vital services. The upcoming final settlement must urgently address this. \"If it doesn't, some councils may struggle to meet their statutory responsibilities.\" Despite the funding challenges, attainment among deaf students rose to a record high in 2015/16 with 47% achieving 5 A*- C GCSE grades. The government says it has committed \\xa3223m extra council funding to widespread special educational needs reforms in an effort to ensure deaf students \"get the support that is right for them\". Robert Goodwill, Minister of State for Children and Families, did not directly address the staffing shortages, but said \"most children who are deaf are able to attend their local schools while receiving expert advice, and for those with more complex needs there are specialist deaf schools.\"  ] ",

Many of us readily believe the reports of Trump's comment because we know him to be notoriously crude. For years he has displayed an obsession with race, ethnicity, religion and gender. When he was merely a bragging businessman, his relentless effort to alienate us from each other could be dismissed as a private citizen's character flaw -- of less consequence because he was essentially a showman and a hype artist.

I respect him for that,\" yet adding, \"He's a Mexican.\" In fact, the judge was born in the United States. It is, of course, only human for us to feel anxiety about people who may be different from us. The tendency to categorize others is a well-established element of human nature. But it is also human to seek to work against our prejudices and to understand that others always deserve respect.  Swedish, not German? For at least four decades, Trump has aired rather strange views about heritage and identity. As a young man, he repeated his father Fred's false claim that the Trump family -- the name was once Drumpf -- emigrated from Sweden, and not Germany. The senior Trump began calling himself Swedish after World War II because, as Donald Trump told me, he didn't want Jewish New Yorkers to connect him with the Nazi regime and take their business elsewhere. This assumption, which Donald agreed with, betrays an exceedingly dim view of human nature. The Trumps expected bigotry from Jewish New Yorkers and they were willing to turn their backs on their ancestors to make money. As Donald Trump moved through his adult life, he has regularly demonstrated an extraordinary level of concern about the ethnic and racial identity of people he encountered. When he testified before a committee in Congress about competing casino operators from Native American tribes, he complained, out loud, that they \"don't look like Indians to me.\" In his book about Trump's years as a casino operator in Atlantic City, former Trump executive John R. O'Donnell [wrote](http://fair.org/take-action/media- advisories/ignoring-trumps-record-of-racism/) of how his boss made bigoted statements about African-Americans and Jews. O'Donnell quoted Trump saying: \"Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes... Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else ... Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that's guy's lazy.

In May 1997, he told Playboy writer Mark Bowden about the book generally, \"The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true.\" Two years later, when he was eying a third-party run for president he told Tim Russert, \"I've never said anything like it.\"  Fair housing case Prior to Trump's involvement in gambling, his real estate organization was subject to a crackdown by the US government for failing to comply with fair housing laws governing applications for apartments by minorities. Trump answered with a countersuit in which his lawyer likened the feds to the \"Gestapo\" and \"storm troopers.\" The countersuit was dismissed by the judge in the case. In the end, Trump [settled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments- racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23 /fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html?utm_term=.48734a47bd3d) the case by agreeing to comply with the law and without admitting wrongdoing. In 1989, he was back in the press again, [telling](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/the-absolute- trumpest-121328) Bryant Gumbel that, \"A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market.\" Foreigners have also come in for Trump's prejudice on a regular basis. In the 1980s it was the Japanese who secretly \"laugh like hell\" after completing unfair business deals. Now it's the Chinese, whom Trump [mocks](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-mocks-asians- broken-english-speech-article-1.2338344) by speaking broken English, but also offers as the wily, if not sneaky, bargainers who take advantage of America.  Leader of the birthers For much of President Obama's presidency, Trump led the so-called \"birther\" movement, alleging, in ridiculous defiance of all evidence, that Obama was born outside the US and may not be a real American citizen. This campaign, which he pursued long after others dropped it, was clearly an attempt to turn the first African-American president into a foreign \"other\" and thus, presumably, render him illegitimate. When comedian Jon Stewart went after him on his satirical nightly broadcast, Trump reached once again for an argument based on ethnicity. He [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/330360556362018816) \"If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz. He should be proud of his heritage!\" This from a German- American man who had posed as Swedish. Trump started off his run for the presidency with a bigoted rant about undocumented Mexicans, braying about how \"they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" The effect of this talk was to ramp up public anxieties about people who are actually less likely to commit crimes than others. A pair of Massachusetts men were arrested for beating a Latino person they encountered on the street and, according to police, one of them said, \"Donald Trump was right.\" Next, Trump retweeted false \"data\" alleging that black assailants account for more than 80% of white deaths due to homicide. The numbers [were too high by a factor of five.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald- trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/) And don't forget Donald Trump's attitudes about the 1.5 billion Muslims of this world. One of his first acts as president was to establish a travel ban, which has since been modified, that targeted citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.  Dividing Americans Trump's divisive view of people is a deeply felt belief that he has passed on to the younger generation of Trumps. His eldest son Donald Jr. told me that, \"Like him [Donald Sr.], I'm a big believer in race-horse theory. He's an incredibly accomplished guy, my mother's incredibly accomplished, she's an Olympian, so I'd like to believe genetically I'm predisposed to better-than- average.\" In Trump's world, comments about a person's ethnic and racial background are fair game. And yet he [says](http://fox6now.com/2015/12/09/donald-trump-in- cnn-interview-i-am-the-least-racist-person-that-you-have-ever-met/), \"I am the least racist person you have ever met.\" Follow CNN Opinion Join us on [Twitter ](http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Trump's kind of thinking was common in the 1950s, when he was a boy. This is the period evoked when he says he wants to \"Make America Great Again.\" In fact, the 1950s were marred in many ways, including by the stereotypes people clung to about group identity. Thankfully, most Americans grew beyond this type of thinking and learned to consider people as individuals and view character as paramount. What's most worrying about Trump is the evidence that he has not joined the rest of us. ] ",

      "article": "[ MINNEAPOLIS 4 When Erin Rathke, the principal at Justice Page Middle School, is called to extract a student from class, she hears the same plea over and over again, most often, she has to admit, from black children: cThe teacher only sees me. , The plea weighs heavily at Justice Page, where African-American students are 338 percent more likely to be suspended than their white peers. cIt 9s painful sometimes, but I have to say, 8Yes, that 9s probably true, 9 Ms. Rathke said. , It is a reality that district leaders here have been grappling with for years: The Minneapolis school district suspends an inordinate number of black students compared with white ones, and it is struggling to figure out why. Last year, districtwide, black students were 41 percent of the overall student population, but made up 76 percent of the suspensions. , Numbers like that prompted the Obama administration in 2014 to draft tough new policies to try to address racial disparities in school discipline across the country. Now, the Trump administration is trying to reverse those policies 4 in part, administration officials say, as a response to school shootings like the massacre last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. , The Obama-era policies 4 and the Trump-era reversals 4 have divided educators in the Twin Cities. In recent months, educators from Minneapolis, St. Paul and suburban Minnesota traveled to Washington to lobby the Education Department in support of reversing the 2014 guidelines, which encouraged school districts to review racial disparities in student discipline rates to ensure against violations of federal civil rights laws. Those that do not comply can face federal investigation or a loss of funding. , Then another group followed them to lobby for keeping the guidance. , A retired Minnesota teacher set off a conservative [media blitz](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/02/teacher-coalition- seeks-to-end-obama-school-discipline-policy-a-lot-of-fear-in-schools/) by linking the Obama-era guidance to frustrations that teachers have with violent students, raising the issue high enough for the White House to latch on after the Parkland massacre. The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement. , [Debbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/14/ann-coulter-secret- debate-tip-gop/) article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident. , [ **ALSO READ** : [How Effective is Your School District?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/upshot/a-better-way- to-compare-public- schools.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)] , The story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers 9 authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed. ,  cIt 9s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy, Ms. York said. , Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance. , Civil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system. , In a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would cvery likely substantiate claims of a persistent inequality in the ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities. ,  cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance, Mr. Scott wrote. , But in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators 9 perception of both. ,  cWe 9re in a pressure cooker, said Michael Thomas, the district 9s chief of schools. cAnd what 9s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what 9s happening across America. , While critics of the Obama-era discipline changes [argue](http://educationnext.org/supposed-discipline-fix-threatens-school- cultures-forum-petrilli/) that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start. , Bernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included cgifted but can 9t use his words and chigh strung, with their actions excused because they chad a hard day. , Black children, she said, were cdestructive and cviolent, and ccannot be managed. ,  cWhen you see something like that and you 9re a leader, and you 9re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward 4 it was alarming, Ms. Johnson said. , [ **ALSO READ** : [Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white- and-black-men.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)] , Nationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state 9s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the [largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation](https://wallethub.com/edu /states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-financial-gaps-by-race/9842/). , Last month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices. ,  cWe 9re at a tipping point, and that 9s what you see in the schools said Kevin Lindsey, the state 9s human rights commissioner. , The school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation. ,  cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably, Mr. Thomas said. cWe 9re still adjusting our listening frequency. , But some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is [a student 9s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad](http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-teen-faces-sentencing-for-attack- on-teacher-at-central-high/364220771/). Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a [Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials](https://www.twincities.com/2017/11/17/battered-st-paul-teacher- meeting-with-trump-officials-over-school-discipline/) to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies. , Simon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district 9s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as ccultural dialect, he said. ,  cIt threw the school into complete chaos, he said. cThe kids knew they weren 9t going to go home. , Mr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word cdetention, but rather cquality time. Eventually, he would just csweep a lot under the rug. , The discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years 4 a warning, then a consequence 4 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist. ,  cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students, he said. cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist. , The root of those changes was in the district 9s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department 9s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices. , Federal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher 9s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days. , Ms. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses. , The policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a [letter](http://www.newamericancivilrightsproject.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/03/Minneapolis-school-discipline-letter.pdf), Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move clegally and constitutionally suspect. He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline. , One month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned. ,  cWhen people have kids around them that don 9t look like them, they want them controlled, she said. , The district 9s [agreement](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us- education-department-reaches-voluntary-resolution-agreement-following- minneapolis-public-school-district-discipline-investigation) with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies. , There are bright spots. , At Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a cloaded term, said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data 4 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year 4 showed that the school was a chealthy place that emphasized positive reinforcement. , When it comes to misbehavior, cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that 9s wrong with them, he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it 9s our job to figure out why. , But, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended. , Justice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course. , Fresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools. , The school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body. ,  cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day, she said. cSome teachers aren 9t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we 9re not going to give up on students, and I 9m not going to give up on them. , There are signs of hope. Students successfully [campaigned last year to](http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-middle-school-renamed-out-with- alexander-ramsey-in-with-justice-page/428452213/) rename the school for the state 9s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota 9s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes. ,  cWe are more than these numbers, Ms. Rathke said. cBut they 9re telling us something: We have students that we just haven 9t figured out how to support yet. ] ",

Councils will instead have to create a database to identify children not on a school register under plans to revamp home education. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams is due to give a statement on Tuesday. She will also announce plans for a \"comprehensive package of support\" for home educators, including exams help. The plans are for statutory guidance - [compared with the non-statutory guidance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-38603771) published a year ago, which Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, described at the time as \"disappointing\".    She called Tuesday's announcement a \"step in the right direction\". Councils do not need to be told if a child is home educated, unless they are removed from school. The new plans will not change that but will require councils to create a \"reasonably complete\" database so they can identify children who are not on a school register. Ms Williams will consult on how the database will be managed and look at which partners - such as health boards - will be able to contribute to it and whether independent schools should be required to tell councils about pupils in their schools.   * ['I should be home-schooled but I spent 10 months on Xbox'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-41476718)   * [Why I home-educate my daughter](/news/education-42103248)   * [Kids enjoy special play time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/42852581)   * [Home school worry after scurvy death](/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35380182)   Image copyrightWales News ServiceImage caption The CPS decided not to pursue its case of neglect against Dylan Seabridge's parents Glynn and Julie  Ms Holland and NSPCC Cymru both called for a compulsory register of home educated children after Dylan Seabridge - a home-educated eight-year-old - [died of scurvy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35380182) in Pembrokeshire in 2011. A report by the National Independent Safeguarding Board recommended the same thing. Instead, these new plans will outline the arrangements local authorities will be expected to put in place to identify home-educated children and assess the suitability of education. Support for home educators will include help with exam registrations, the same health offers made to children in school, making the [Hwb online learning portal](https://hwb.gov.wales/) available and support from Careers Wales. Ms Williams said: \"There are many valid, different and sometimes complex reasons why parents would choose to go down this route and in some cases this will be the best choice for the child. \"But this choice must be balanced with the right of children to receive a suitable education. \"Local authorities, by establishing a database supported by statutory guidance, will be able to assess whether a child is receiving a suitable education and, if they are educated at home, that home educators have the support they need.\" Ms Holland said she was pleased to see a \"step in the right direction\", adding: \"In reality it means there'll be a statutory requirement for local authorities to know who is being home educated and what those children are being taught.\" The NSPCC said a compulsory register would help to ensure children did not become \"invisible to authorities, adding: \"Greater support for home educators and steps to improve data are welcome but we would like to see the Welsh Government go further.\"  ] ",

(Patrick Semansky/AP) Did Education Secretary Betsy DeVos just trash America 9s higher education system? Here, among other things, is what DeVos said on Thursday about America 9s higher education system 4 still widely seen as the world 9s best despite enormous challenges 4 during an address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors at its winter meeting in Washington: > And you have the power to convene local efforts with business leaders, entrepreneurial educators, parents and students. You can help broaden horizons and encourage everyone to embrace multiple pathways to success after high school. > > I 9m reminded of a recent conversation I had with the Israeli ambassador to the United States. He posed a rather provocative question: cWhy hasn 9t America 9s higher ed bubble burst? He was baffled as to why America 9s businesses haven 9t simply stepped in to create their own education programs to equip individuals with the necessary skills, instead of relying on others to get it right for them. In many other parts of the world, employers and educators work hand-in-hand to line up the skills required with those actually taught. > > When it comes to higher education, too many implicitly or explicitly suggest there is only one path to success. That must stop! Her speech struck some familiar themes: public education hasn 9t changed much since the 1800s and solutions to improve education cannot come from the federal government. She also urged businesses to become more involved in training Americans for jobs, saying the higher education system in America is not getting the job done. That sentiment underpins an important debate about the purpose of higher education, highlighted when Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) in 2015 [quietly tried to change](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer- sheet/wp/2015/02/05/how-gov-walker-tried-to-quietly-change-the-mission-of-the- university-of-wisconsin/) the University of Wisconsin system 9s century- old mission. He proposed removing words in the state code that command the university to csearch for truth and cimprove the human condition and replace them with cmeet the state 9s workforce needs. DeVos has been on the Walker side of the argument, arguing that higher education institutions are not preparing students to meet 21st century needs.  cThere is a fundamental disconnect between education and the economy, she said in her Thursday speech. cFar too many students are simply unprepared. It 9s worth noting that such a level of unpreparedness apparently hasn 9t stopped the economy from growing during the Trump administration. Perhaps the link between the economy and education is not as strong as many say, or if it is, perhaps America 9s schools are better than given credit for being (which isn 9t to say that many aren 9t troubled). _[[ U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent rate, a win for Trump ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/27/u-s-economy-grew-3 -percent-from-july-to-september-meeting-trumps-goal/?utm_term=.7271fcdf36a5)]_ She also said that cacross states and industries, there are 6 million job openings, as the 8blue collar 9 jobs of yesterday become the 8blue tech 9 jobs of today. Actually, the suggestion that 6 million jobs are open because Americans are unqualified to do all of them is not true,[ according to this Washington Post story from 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/08/there- are-7-million-unemployed-and-6-2-million-job-openings-whats-the- problem/?utm_term=.d59b014a7a14), which said there are a number of reasons for the openings, including that many employers don 9t pay enough and that many of the jobs are low-skilled. It also said: > It 9s telling that [5 of the 10 jobs](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_104.htm) the U.S. government projects will grow the fastest over the next decade pay less than $25,000 a year.

The technology industry 9s crackdown against users accused of chate speech after August 9s cUnite the Right rally in Charlottesville has fueled allegations of political bias against\\xa0companies that are playing a crucial role is disseminating speech worldwide. _[[ Read Damore's suit ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6p02fijxrd7c6m/20180108%20Damore%20-%20Complaint_fs.pdf?dl=0)]_ The suit by Damore, filed in Santa Clara, Calif., alleges discrimination by Google against men, people of the cCaucasian race, and people with perceived conservative political views.\\xa0 The suit says that Google employees who expressed views deviating from the majority at Google on politics or on employment practices, including cdiversity hiring policies, bias sensitivity, and social justice, were csingled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated from Google, in violation of their legal rights. Damore 9s fellow plaintiff in the class action is another Google employee, a former software engineer named David Gudeman. Google fired Damore after he\\xa0wrote a 10-page memo\\xa0 titled cGoogle 9s Ideological Echo Chamber: How bias clouds our thinking about diversity and inclusion. Though initially circulated internally in July, it reached a wide audience in August when Motherboard published the memo, saying the c[anti-diversity memo had gone cinternally viral d](https://motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees- anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at- google?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=amp&utm_source=motherboard.vice.com- RelayMediaAMP)\\xa0at the Mountain View, Calif.-based technology company.\\xa0The memo said that cgenetic differences may explain cwhy we don 9t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. The company, which called the memo coffensive and charmful, soon fired Damore, further elevating him in the eyes of his supporters as a victim of what\\xa0they called an overreaching cpolitical correctness and ideology rigidity within the tech industry. Damore, who also filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, appeared to embrace his rising political visibility, posing in a T-shirt with the word cGoolag written in a multicolored style that mimicked Google 9s familiar logo. Google spokesman, Ty Sheppard, said in response to the lawsuit: cWe look forward to defending against Mr. Damore 9s lawsuit in court. At a\\xa0news conference, Damore 9s lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, said her client had attended various company meetings and discussions dedicated to diversity. At one such event on campus, Damore had questioned human resources staff about whether political bias was included in the company 9s diversity hiring goals, and was told it wasn 9t. He was asked to contribute feedback after the event, which led him to write his memo. Before the memo went public, he said he had received feedback from nearly 200 different Google employees, including human resources staff, over the course of several weeks. That gave Damore the impression that he was having an open discussion with colleagues, and he did not realize he was in trouble until 48 hours before he was let go. Damore 9s legal complaint\\xa0filled over 200 pages and included screenshots of emails and other correspondence between Damore and Google employees, and anonymous complaints from current Google employees who hold conservative viewpoints. One screenshot showed an email from a Google engineer who wrote Damore, cYou 9re a misogynist and a terrible human. I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired. Another screenshot shows how a Google employee received a so-called peer bonus 4 in which a colleague can recommend another colleague for a bonus 4 for speaking out against the values in Damore 9s memo. The complaint described another Google event, the company 9s weekly call-hands, in which Google executives cshamed teams that did not have 50 percent women on staff.  cThere 9s a Lord of the Flies mentality there, said Dhillon. cWhere a person can be singled out, shamed, and fired. Dhillon is a prominent Republican in California who was reportedly considered for a Justice Department position in the Trump administration. She recently represented Republican students at the University of California at Berkeley who sued their school to allow conservative media personality Ann Coulter to speak there on a specific day. (The school had rescheduled Coulter 9s event\\xa0because of\\xa0security concerns). At the\\xa0news conference, held in Dhillon 9s office in San Francisco office, Damore was asked whether he was a Trump supporter. He declined to answer. Later on Monday, Johnson\\xa0sued\\xa0Twitter for allegedly violating his right to free speech by [permanently suspending his account](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/05/26 /charles-johnson-one-of-the-internets-most-infamous-trolls-has-finally-been- banned-from-twitter/?utm_term=.38c92fd71720)\\xa0after a tweet in which he\\xa0sought to raise money for ctaking out a Black Lives Matter activist. Johnson filed the suit in state superior court in San Francisco, where Twitter is headquartered. He has long maintained that he was seeking not violence but an investigation that might damage the public standing of the activist, DeRay McKesson. Johnson asserted in the suit that Twitter 9s real motivation in banning him was to quash conservative voices online and that the company failed to follow its own cvague and subjective rules for suspending user accounts. The suit calls Twitter cthe modern public square, and says, cLike the company towns of old, it is a privately-owned public square. And therein lies the danger. Twitter declined to comment on the suit Monday. Like many other technology companies, it has long portrayed itself as a bastion of free speech and said it has acted to block users only after they violate the company 9s terms of service, including bans on hateful speech or speech intended to incite violence against people or groups. Johnson, often described as cright-wing troll for his aggressive investigations and online tactics, cites in his suit internal Twitter emails [published in December by BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel /internal-emails-show-twitter-struggled-to-interpret-its- own?utm_term=.my6xOeGnx.dkdXb4D2X) that appear to demonstrate uncertainty over how to handle Johnson. An email cited by the article says that Johnson was personally banned by Richard Costolo, Twitter 9s chief executive at the time. An email that BuzzFeed said came from Costolo said, cTo be very clear, I don 9t want to find out we unsuspended this Chuck Johnson troll later on. . . . That account is permanently suspended and nobody for no reason may reactivate it. Johnson operates two sites, GotNews and WeSearchr, that often have sparked controversy. WeSearchr raises money, called cbounties, for information and causes that often have a sharply political cast, including money to help defend a neo-Nazi website called the Daily Stormer against a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Twitter has banned Johnson personally and the accounts for GotNews and WeSearchr. GotNews is a co- plaintiff in the suit, along with Johnson.  cTwitter is silencing conversation on the right-of-center perspectives, Johnson said in an interview. cThis has been the standing playbook of how tech companies deal with voices that come from groups they don 9t like. The American legal system has long given wide latitude to technology companies and the manner in which they choose to enforce their terms of service. But the suit makes particular reference to the California\\xa0state constitution 9s guarantee of free speech. Courts in that state have in the past\\xa0highlighted the importance of\\xa0free speech rights even when exercised on private property, making the state potentially more amenable to Johnson 9s claims about censorship on a private online platform such as Twitter, said Jonathan Zittrain, faculty director of Harvard 9s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.  cOf all the places to bring a long-shot case like this, California would be the place, Zittrain said. He added that technology companies, because of their crucial role in airing constitutionally protected speech, need to have rigorous and transparent procedures for deciding when to suspend users. ] ",

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) For 43 years, schoolkids and their parents have clipped the labels from cookie bags and cracker boxes as part of a popular rewards program called Labels for Education. Through this and similar programs 4 think Tyson 9s Project A+ or General Mills 9 Box Tops for Education 4 schools get cash and supplies in exchange for clipped labels from participating food items. But these programs, most of which are wildly popular at U.S. schools, may have major downsides for students. Critics say they are designed to sell junk food to children too young to make good health decisions. Just this month, as Labels for Education wound down 4 a result of declining participation, said its parent company, Campbell 9s 4 public health advocates cheered the end of a program widely beloved by teachers, schools and parents. It included snack foods, such as cookies and crackers, that many health advocates say should be discouraged.  cIt 9s just another form of junk-food marketing to kids, said Colin Schwartz, a senior nutrition policy associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, one of several groups that has celebrated the demise of Labels for Education. cWe 9re glad to see Campbell 9s ending its program, and we 9re calling on other companies to take the same step. Besides Campbell 9s, two other companies dominate school rewards: General Mills and, to a far lesser extent,\\xa0Tyson.\\xa0Each company awards schools a set amount of money 4 roughly 5 to 38 cents 4 for each purchase code or label collected from participating products. Those products carry a distinctive logo\\xa0on the front of the box or bag. Schools publicize that logo to parents via conferences and meetings, as well as through materials sent home with their kids. Many schools also promote rewards programs directly to students, [holding contests](https://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/805-labels-and- box-tops-collect-more-when-kids-compete) and [constructing bulletin boards](https://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/806-box-tops- champs-share-collection-tricks) to encourage them to bring more labels in. Once the labels are collected, schools exchange them for cash or supplies, ranging from pencils and markers to playground equipment. The average payout is modest 4 $750 per school per year, in the case of General Mills 4 but that can go a long way at some schools, program participants say. At Glover Community Learning Center, a small, low-income elementary school in Akron, Ohio, money from Box Tops and Labels for Education has bought jump ropes, gym balls, pencil sharpeners, paintbrushes, markers and an insulated water cooler.  cWe 9re a small school, and these programs are a big help, said Kia Strickling, the president of the school 9s parent-teacher association. cThe alternative is teachers buying basic supplies out of their own pockets. Critics don 9t object to schools getting much-needed funds. But they do protest the nutritional quality of the foods in rewards programs and schools' role in promoting them, which potentially undermines nutrition education and could boost kids 9 lifelong taste for unhealthy foods. Campbell 9s, which also owns brands such as SpaghettiOs and Pepperidge Farm, has slapped the Labels for Education logo on frozen desserts and queso dip. Tyson 9s Project A+\\xa0includes salty chicken nuggets. When it comes to Box Tops, by far the most popular of the programs, [a recent study](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2017/08/29/box-tops-foods- smart-snacks-standards/)\\xa0by researchers at Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health and MassGeneral Hospital for Children\\xa0found that two- thirds of the products bearing the Box Tops label do not meet federal nutrition requirements for sale in schools.  cThe vast majority of these products can't be sold in schools, so they shouldn't be advertised in schools, Schwartz said. Food companies point out that their rewards labels appear on healthier foods, too, such as vegetable soups and juices, in the case of Campbell 9s, or yogurt and Cheerios, in the case of General Mills. And they argue that, even if the labels sometimes appear on unhealthy foods, the program is designed to appeal to the parents making shopping decisions, not their school-age children. All\\xa0three companies have strict policies on marketing to kids.  cThe [Labels for Education] program 9s marketing is directed to adult coordinators and parents, not to kids, Campbell 9s said in a statement.  cBox Tops for Education is NOT a brand marketing program, echoed General Mills spokeswoman Mollie Wulff in an email. cIt is a fundraising program for parents and a way for General Mills to support local communities and schools. But for critics, this is another point of contention: Children are often highly involved in rewards programs, they say, and schools often advertise the programs directly to them. At Strickling 9s school in Akron, the PTA holds contests to see which classroom can collect the most labels and awards a pizza party to the winner. That type of in-school promotion can cause children to develop positive associations with both the labels and the products they appear on, said Jennifer Harris, a researcher at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. Those associations can be difficult to overwrite once they are established.  cThere 9s a reason companies want to get kids when they 9re really young, said Harris. cWhen aimed at children, whose minds are still developing, marketing can create lifelong preferences and habits that contribute to obesity and other conditions. Critics have proposed excluding from the rewards programs any product that doesn 9t meet the Department of Agriculture 9s minimum nutrition guidelines for in-school sales. Schools could also work harder to cut students out of rewards programs by promoting them directly, and only, to parents, critics said. Many public health advocates would like to see schools withdraw from these programs entirely. But that is unlikely, said Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado 9s National Education Policy Center, because many schools have grown accustomed to the payouts to supplement decreased public funds. With the exception of Campbell 9s Labels for Education, rewards programs remain highly popular.  cThere are no good solutions for schools, said Boninger, who opposes the programs. cSchools don 9t have the money they need, which is why they resort to these food company handouts. At the Glover school in Akron, Strickling says she thinks cgood solutions are indeed running out. Funding has dwindled for art and gym classes at the school, she said, a result of districtwide budget cuts. The end of Labels for Education was a blow. Now Strickling is doubling down on General Mills 9 Box Tops for Education, with a wary eye on the public health advocates calling for the program to end. She doesn 9t think rewards programs market to children.  cI really disagree with that, she said. cParents have to choose healthy snacks. If I buy Froot Loops when Nature Valley has the label 4 you can 9t blame the school or the company for that. **Read more:** [How to fix the American diet, according to the man who coined the term 'junk food'](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2017/12/28/how-to-fix- the-american-diet-according-to-the-man-who-coined-the-phrase-junk-food/) [Food-makers are taking salt and sugar out of food.

That 9s one of the claims in Knepper 9s $300 million gender discrimination suit against [Ogletree Deakins](https://ogletree.com/ \"Link to Website\"). The firm is dominated by male decision-makers who foster a culture \"that marginalizes, demeans, and undervalues women,\" according to the suit.        Knepper, a nonequity shareholder, contends that while Ogletree 9s website boasts about diversity and equality, about 80 percent of its equity partners are men -- a setup that results in missed opportunities and less pay for women.\\xa0Her proposed class-action complaint against the firm, with more than 700 lawyers in the U.S., was filed Jan. 12 in federal court in San Francisco.

Ryan King, a spokesman for Ogletree Deakins, said equal opportunity has always been a core principle of the firm, and that discrimination of any kind isn 9t tolerated. More than half of the firm 9s employees are women, including many of its most successful attorneys and two of four elected members of its compensation committee, he said.  Pay Policies \"The decision-making process that governs our compensation system is both fair and equitable,\" King said in a statement. \"We will confidently defend the firm against these claims as we remain steadfast in our commitment to equal opportunity for all.\" King said the firm uses an \"open compensation\" system under which all shareholders know what every other shareholder earns, as well as the factors used in setting that pay. He added that female shareholders in California have made more on average during the past four years than their male counterparts.     David Stanford, an attorney who represents Knepper, said the firm 9s pay data for men and women employees across the U.S. aren 9t that simple. He said he has more women -- both equity and non-equity shareholders-- lined up to join the lawsuit. Each potential plaintiff will bring added facts, he said. \"Ms. Knepper has raised her underpayment in every shareholder compensation interview and has submitted follow-up appeals as well,\" the suit states. \"Her complaints have fallen on deaf ears.\" Knepper, who joined the firm in 2005 in\\xa0San Antonio, Texas, also says a male lawyer denied her requests for more business opportunities, turned down her bid to attend a Southern California conference for the Association of Corporate Counsel, and refused to let her speak at a seminar for in-house counsel that draws hundreds of attendees from around the world, including some of her own clients. Female lawyers face hurdles at all levels in their career. While women make up over half of current law school graduates, they only make up 35 percent of lawyers at law firms, a survey from Law 360 found last year. A 2016 survey by the legal staffing firm Major, Lindsey & Africa of 2,100 law partners found women earned an average of $659,000 a year compared with an average of $949,000 for male partners.\\xa0 The case is Knepper v.

Fifty-three percent rate him as a poor president. A stunning 87 percent want the cdreamers to stay, and opinion is split as to whether it is worth a government shutdown (46/48) to get a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals fix. By contrast, his wall garners only 35 percent approval; 61 percent disapprove. Americans have a preference for immigrants selected on cbackground (47 percent) over those with family connections (39 percent).

In short, virtually everything Trump and his anti-immigrant crowd believe (the wall, excluding people from s***hole countries) is out of step with a very high percentage of Americans. The notion that immigrants from poor countries deplete us defies common sense, history and economic reality. Nevertheless, the aversion to people who are predominately brown and black runs high in this administration. It also demonstrates a painful lack of economic literacy, ignorance about our aging workforce and willful blindness about the entrepreneurial contributions of immigrants and their children.

Of adults 25 years or older born in Africa and living in the U.S., 41.7 percent have a bachelor 9s degree or more, according to 2009 data.

They are also much less likely to commit violent crimes than native-born Americans. Sessions 9s vision of people from poor countries as unskilled, unable to acquire skills and illiterate is nothing but blatant racism. His assumption that they will not be successful is contrary to the history of America as a haven for immigrants who come to better themselves. He 9s turned the Statute of Liberty ( cGive me \\u2026 your huddled masses . . .) on her head. He plainly has a view of who should be an American, and it does not include the best and brightest brown and black people from around the world.

      "article": "[ WASHINGTON 4 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis acknowledged Tuesday that he and President Donald Trump 9s incoming national security adviser, John Bolton, have different world views but predicted they will develop a working partnership.  cI look forward to working with him 4 no reservations, no concerns at all, Mattis told reporters at an impromptu news conference. cLast time I checked he 9s an American. I 9m not in the least bit concerned. Mattis said he has never met Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations and conservative firebrand. He said he expects Bolton to pay a visit to the Pentagon soon, perhaps this week, to begin developing a relationship.  cI 9ll tell you right up front: it 9s going to be a partnership, he said. When a reporter mentioned that people see his world view as significantly different than that of Bolton, Mattis replied, cThat 9s the normal thing you want, unless you want group- think. Bolton, who will replace Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on April 9, has publicly advocated for overthrowing the North Korean government, possibly by force. Mattis, a retired Marine general who knows intimately the costs of war, favors diplomacy to rid the North of its nuclear weapons and has said war on the Korean peninsula would be ccatastrophic. On Iran, too, Mattis would seem at odds with Bolton, who has argued for abandoning the Obama-era nuclear deal. These and other matters of war and peace will test Mattis 9 influence with Trump as his national security team is overhauled. Mattis was sometimes at odds with McMaster, but the arrival of the hawkish Bolton, combined with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the uncertain status of John Kelly as White House chief of staff, appears to leave Mattis more isolated than at any time since he took over the Pentagon 15 months ago. The North Korea issue is front-and-center: Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean President Kim Jong Un by May to discuss the North 9s nuclear disarmament. The unprecedented summit could be a turning point in a decades- old U.S.-North Korean standoff that Trump himself has said could end in cfire and fury - an American nuclear attack __ to stop the North from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile.  cThis is buckle-up time, retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said last week on MSNBC. cFor the military I have three words: Sharpen your swords. He (Bolton) is someone who is going to reach for the military instrument. The changes in the White House and at the State Department, while significant for Mattis, are hardly heart-stopping. People close to him sense no change in his commitment to the job; some suggest that Trump 9s decision to move former Republican congressman and current CIA director Mike Pompeo to State, replacing Tillerson, could benefit Mattis in the sense that he 9ll have a partner at State who is better aligned with Trump. Publicly, Mattis has said little about the shakeup. He was in Afghanistan when Tillerson got the ax. When reporters asked his reaction a couple of days later, Mattis said he preferred not to comment on the details, although he went on to suggest that its importance was being exaggerated. He said that in all of his discussions abroad with foreign government officials and American troops, the matter was not brought up once.  cI understand why you 9re asking, but I 9m just pointing out that in most parts of the world this is a Washington, D.C., story, he said. Another Washington story is Mattis and his ability to forge a workable relationship with Trump despite differences on some issues like the Iran nuclear deal, which Mattis says is flawed but worth honoring as long as the Iranians do. Mattis also has differed with the president over Trump 9s wish to bar all transgender people from serving in the military, and he helped sway Trump from his inclination last year to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan. The Mattis formula seems to be simple. Out of the spotlight, out of trouble. The less he says publicly, the less he risks losing influence with Trump.  cPart of his success ... is absolutely the fact that you don 9t see him in the limelight terribly much, says Loren Dejonge Schulman, a defense analyst at the Center for a New American Security who served in key national security positions in the White House and Pentagon under President Barack Obama. cThat may be keeping him out of trouble with the White House but I think it 9s setting an incredibly bad precedent in terms of Pentagon transparency. If Mattis, who spent more than 40 years in uniform and is the first career military officer to lead the Pentagon since George C. Marshall in the early 1950s, isn 9t the most experienced politician to run the military 9s vast bureaucracy, he has shown a knack for staying out of trouble with his thin-skinned boss. Mattis has even broken Trump of his habit of calling the retired general cMad Dog, which Mattis insists was a media invention to begin with. Trump frequently has lunch and dinners with the defense secretary and speaks glowingly of him to outside advisers. White House officials have said that Trump sometimes repeats military historical anecdotes he heard from Mattis. Even Mattis 9 few known stumbles have not dogged him. In August, for example, Mattis told sailors at a submarine base in his home state of Washington that the Navy would give them the worst and the best days of their lives, and then added, cThat means you 9re not some (expletive) sitting on the sidelines, he said. cYou know what I mean, kind of sitting there saying, 8Well, I should have done something with my life. 9 His language was quickly forgotten. The episode pointed to a man who has shaped the job and not let it shape him. So much so that perhaps the most poignant criticism of his tenure has been the secrecy with which the military has handled everything from troop deployment numbers to the details of its military strategies 4 things that often were made public under previous secretaries. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.

The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) says schools too often refuse permission to attend its exams even if pupils will only be away for a couple of hours. Ministers say they support pupils taking arts exams in school hours. But RAD says the position is confusing and wants the guidance made clearer. [Since 2013, official guidance on term-time leave](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36277836) has said authorised absences should only be granted in \"exceptional circumstances\".    The RAD says this has caused problems for its own ballet examinations and is also an issue for children taking dance, drama and music exams with some other boards. According to RAD exams director Andrew McBirnie, before 2013 ballet exams could be run \"during the school day and the student was able to leave a class at say 10 o'clock, do their exam and be back by lunchtime - and that seemed to be a perfectly legitimate activity that the student might be doing as part of their all-round education. \"Increasingly over the last few years... there have been more and more schools saying: 'No we can't allow this any more because of this issue with unauthorised absence.'\"  'Mood music' In a recent letter to Ed Vaizey MP, England's education secretary Damian Hinds, said the government expected schools to be sympathetic to requests for leave to take these exams. \"As long as they are satisfied that time away from school will not have a negative effect on a child's education.\" But the letter also says the Department for Education does not explicitly state what constitutes an exceptional circumstance. \"These decisions are best made by head teachers who will know their pupils' individual circumstances best.\" In response, Mr Vaizey said: \"The supportive stance from Damian Hinds is hugely welcome - but greater clarity is still needed. \"I will continue to work with RAD on the issue and will write to the Minister for Education regarding new guidelines for schools\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Mr McBirnie welcomed Mr Vaizey's dialogue with Mr Hinds and hopes it will help persuade more heads to allow pupils to attend performing arts exams in school hours. However, he says the message is still mixed \"between what the guidelines say and the mood music\" from ministers. \"There is no definition or further guidelines about what \"exceptional circumstances\" means at all. So it totally comes down to the interpretation of that phrase which is very vague. \"What's exceptional for one head teacher might not be exceptional for another and to be honest leaving school for a dance exam is not exceptional, it's actually quite routine that children leave to take a dance or drama exam outside school and then come back.\" Ideally, Mr McBirnie says he would like examples of activities where schools would be expected to authorise absence added to the guidance. The National Association of Head Teachers said authorising absences was \"difficult territory for schools because they are so severely held to account for attendance figures\". Deputy General Secretary, Nick Brook, agreed that \"in truth external arts exams are not exceptional circumstances, they are a well understood everyday element of school life. \"A list of approved activities risks creating unnecessary tension. \"What's important is that as long as the school is satisfied that time away will not have a negative effect on a child's education, absence to attend an external exam should be reason enough.\"  ] ",

Rooks_ That is a striking truth at the heart of an important new book, [ cCutting School: Privatization, Segregation, and The End of Public Education. d](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/154146091X?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=154146091X) It was written by Noliwe M. Rooks, director of American studies at Cornell University whose research includes racial inequality in education. Rooks takes a unique look at the history of and the forces driving the privatization and deregulation in public education today 4 which is supported by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. She explains how 19th century Reconstruction-era policies led to the creation of separate, segregated and unequal systems of schooling 4 in which black children from poor families got inferior educations. And, coining the term csegrenomics, she links that era to today, when companies and individuals are profiting handsomely from segregated and inequitable education. Along with this analysis, Rooks looks at people and movements who are fighting segregated education and working to save urban public schools, and she argues that integration is the antidote to crumbling school districts and efforts to privatize public education. Rooks, who served for 10 years as the associate director of African American studies at Princeton University, is an interdisciplinary scholar who explores how race and gender are connected to popular culture, social history and political life. Her earlier books are [ cWhite Money/Black Power d](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807032719?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0807032719) and [ cHair Raising. d](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813523125?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0813523125) Here is a Q & A I did with Rooks, followed by a podcast she recently did with education blogger Jennifer Berkshire, author of\\xa0[the Have You Heard blog and podcast, ](http://edushyster.com/tfas-diversity-paradox-2/)which is worth listening to for additional insight into the book. **Fascinating book. Please talk briefly about the central premise and why you decided to write this now.** I had been thinking about segregation, poverty and education for the better part of 10 years before I actually decided there was a book here worth writing. I think it was on my mind, not so much because of my personal experiences with public education, but because on Princeton 9s campus, where I was working at the time, the topic of education and education reform was everywhere. Of course, Wendy Kopp had come up with the idea for what would become Teach For America while a senior at the school and for many of my students, she occupied rock-star status. But it wasn 9t just TFA that excited students. There were also charter school chains, and venture capitalist firms that were focused on narrowing the opportunity and achievement gaps between students who were wealthy and those who were not, and various consulting firms focusing on education policy and creform organizations began to recruit on the campus with success rates that rivaled those of the financial services companies. Really wealthy titans of industry (often billionaires) began proposing solutions and funding educational cinnovations or experiments designed to close the so-called achievement gaps. There was even a film, cWaiting for Superman, that focused all this attention on struggling schools and communities and talked about fixing all this as an extension of the civil rights movement for our age. Initially, I was totally, and pretty much uncritically enthusiastic about all of it. However, as time went on, I couldn 9t help but begin to notice that the students who were most involved in much of the planning and organizing were white and came from middle and upper-middle class schools. They really didn 9t think it was important to include families and caregivers and students in discussions about what they wanted to see in their neighborhoods, communities and schools, and so much of what was touted as positive interventions involved teaching students in these schools how to raise their hands, sit up straight, take tests, and learn to accept stringent discipline. While none of these things in and of themselves are necessarily negative, I couldn 9t help but notice the difference between what was considered opportunity leveling educational strategies in working class and poor communities, and what children in high achieving districts and private schools got. I began to wonder why in order to csave students who were disenfranchised we had to offer them idiosyncratic forms of education that were worlds apart from the ways we educated the wealthy and privileged. Then, I started to notice how interconnected many of the leading figures were in terms of educational backgrounds, philanthropic support and influences, friendships and this burgeoning business in urban and rural education reform. I thought these interconnected relationships were probably a contemporary phenomenon. So I went looking for earlier periods of time when the education of the poor was not quite so idiosyncratic, concentrated in the hands of people outside of those communities and not so tightly tied to business. I kept backing up almost decade by decade looking for a period when there was a sort of unfettered equality in education until I bumped into the beginning of tax-payer-supported education in the South following the Civil War and there was no further back to go. I couldn 9t find it. So then the book stopped being about telling the story of race, segregation and education in the 21st century and became a story about how we got here and about how we have overlooked the fact that providing educational products, forms and services to racially and economically segregated communities is today a multibillion-dollar business and that amount of money makes it difficult to seriously talk about ending educational segregation. If we as a nation really took seriously dismantling underperforming school districts and replacing them with the same types of educational experiences we provide the wealthy, it would negatively impact the bottom lines of many companies. _[[ Why the movement to privatize public education is such a bad idea ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/07/14/why-the- movement-to-privatize-public-education-is-a-very-bad- idea/?utm_term=.aabf4097c488)]_ **The chow we got here is quite a story. You write that cwe have overlooked the fact that providing educational products, forms and services to racially and economically segregated communities is today a multibillion dollar business and that amount of money makes it difficult to seriously talk about ending educational segregation. Do you think it was overlooked or intentional? And how does that work? How does providing products, forms and services to these communities that are racially segregated perpetuate that segregation and make it hard, if not impossible, to talk about ending educational segregation?** Students educated in wealthy schools perform well as measured by standard educational benchmarks. Students educated in poor schools do not. Racial and economic integration is the one systemic solution that we know ensures the tide will lift all educational boats equally. However, instead of committing to educating poor children in the same way as we do the wealthy, or actually with the wealthy, we have offered separate educational content (such as a reoccurring focus on vocational education for the poor) and idiosyncratic forms of educational funding and delivery (such as virtual charter schools and cyber education) as substitutes for what we know consistently works. While not ensuring educational equality, such separate, segregated, and unequal forms of education have provided the opportunity for businesses to make a profit selling schooling. I am calling this specific form of economic profit csegrenomics. Children who live in segregated communities and are Native American, black or Latino are more likely to have severely limited educational options. In the last 30 years, government, philanthropy, business and financial sectors have heavily invested in efforts to privatize certain segments of public education; stock schools with inexperienced, less highly paid teachers whose hiring often provides companies with a cfinder 9s fee d; outsource the running of schools to management organizations; and propose virtual schools as a literal replacement for 4 not just a supplement to 4 the brick and mortar educational experience. The attraction, of course, is the large pot of education dollars that 9s been increasingly available to private corporate financial interests. The public education budget funded by taxpayers is roughly $500 billion to $600 billion per year. Each successful effort that shifts those funds from public to private hands 4 and there has been a growing number of such efforts since the 1980s 4 escalates corporate earnings. **What else did you learn while writing the book?** I kept finding out about young people and parents and community members all over the country who are literally giving their all to ensure that they and their children have a better educational future than they themselves had. So often the inspirational stories we hear about students and parents are only associated with charter schools, and rarely with traditional public schools. For example, I learned about an organization comprised of white parents called c[Integrating Schools ](https://integratedschools.org/)who are committed to sending their middle-class white children to economically vulnerable schools that are majority black or Latino. This is an example of cparental choice different from what the term usually means. We just don 9t hear about white, wealthy parents who think that racial and economic integration is important enough a goal that they make a commitment to helping the integration effort by starting with their own children. Also, I learned that across the country, students are striking and protesting and meeting with elected officials and educational administrators in order to work with them to improve their educational experiences. I had to go looking for these stories. I don 9t know if I would have known that they existed otherwise. I found these stories uplifting and learning about them is one of the reasons I ended the book with narratives of two students who I had taught in college, and who had both gone on to have careers in public education. I don 9t have the last word in the book. They do. I think that is how it should be. **So where do we go from here? How do we even start?** In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech entitled cWhere Do We Go From Here: Community or Chaos? I often reflect on his questions when thinking about where the contemporary paths we are traveling in relation to public education are leading. I think community or chaos are two potential destinations. We have to stop and reflect on where both our educational preferences and policies are leading us. We can either continue to encourage chaos by allowing our tax dollars to be used to educationally experiment on working class and poor children, and disrupt poor communities by closing schools, or we can embrace community by requiring that poor children are educated in the same ways as the wealthy. The choices we make are will tell future generations much of what they will need to know about what our democracy means to us here in the 21st century. _[[ What 8school choice 9 means in the era of Trump and DeVos ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/22/what-school- choice-means-in-the-era-of-trump-and-devos/?utm_term=.2ff950d5e25d)]_ -0-0-  You can [hear an interview with Rooks here](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__kpfa .org_episode_end-2Dpublic-2Deducation- 2D2_&d=DwMF-g&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=GmoBArA9uoOHdqFAi5tjRg0Qvl5sjR7mDsJuhLp1zaA&m =qwmBkw8XnpYhE2LNjTjN- dMm0EyMtyTCWC9nQFf8m8s&s=uIVG0PteDKOiyqICs5chTMPMd6qFVB9ubWtaT2bP9jE&e=).

One suitcase contains items like fliers from early Gay Pride marches and club nights; photos of venues in the 1950s, 960s and 970s; and a pair of brown suede Hush Puppies, which some gay men wore to spot each other at a time when homosexuality still had not been decriminalized in Britain. , Backed by the British government and by state-funded British health care partners, House of Memories has now trained more than 12,000 people nationwide, and is crossing the Atlantic: The [Minnesota Historical Society](http://www.mnhs.org/) plans to offer its version of the app in the fall. , The idea first came to Ms. Rogers as a way of csupporting our aging society, she said. cGlobally, we 9re all living longer, and we all want to live well, but there are older people in our community who are socially isolated, she said. cThey 9re lonely. Among them, people with dementia are particularly isolated, she said, and museums with recent collections could help. Photographs, memorabilia and objects 4 be they the actual items or images of them on apps 4 help rekindle memories in people with dementia and lead them to start conversations. , Ms. Rogers also had a personal motivation. Her mother chad a stroke many years ago, at age 70, cand she had memory loss problems and couldn 9t communicate, she recalled. cFor 10 years, we struggled as a family to connect with her. , She teamed up with colleagues to start a dementia program, seeking input from local caregivers, doctors and nurses, then tried it out with her mother, Margaret. cI knew by her eye contact, by her squeezing of my hand, that she gained great pleasure from having that experience, Ms. Rogers said. cIt was interactive, it was personal. It got right to the hub of Margaret 9s life story. , The next step was to offer the objects, narratives and experiences to dementia sufferers digitally, via an app. It was tested with people who had dementia, as well as caregivers and families. Eileen Gilbert, whose 83-year-old husband, Dave, was found to have Alzheimer 9s four years ago, was part of the app focus group. , When Dave 9s dementia was diagnosed, cit was a shock to us all, she said, referring to her three children, all in their 50s. Even before the diagnosis, she sensed that something was wrong. cThere were silly things that he would forget, Ms. Gilbert said. cHe would say, 8Is one of the children coming home from school? 9 , The tablet-based app offers an array of themes, and Mr. Gilbert chose images of 20th-century Liverpool: the cinemas, the Blacklers department store with the [rocking horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-U-ZWrgjw4 \"Video\") at the top of the stairs, the Punch and Judy puppet show. ,  cNow, I can put the tablet on for Dave, and he can sit there and press the different things, she said. cIt 9s fascinating watching him: He recognizes things on it. ,  cIt 9s kept Dave active, and that helps me, she added. cHe feels as though he 9s still doing something. , In Minnesota, Maren Levad, a museum access specialist at the historical society, said that when her organization decided to extend its new dementia program statewide, it looked for programs and found Liverpool 9s instantly appealing. , Caregivers in Minnesota, she said, needed tools for cmeaningful, person- centered engagement, and cthis is something House of Memories does brilliantly. The program 9s other attraction was cits clear connection to museum resources: using the collections to service the public. , Seeking a partnership, the historical society 4 whose dementia program is based in St. Paul 4 contacted House of Memories the very week of the app 9s launch. Thanks to funding from the [Institute of Museums and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/) in the United States, the Minnesota society is now the program 9s national headquarters. , The app is being tailored to the United States in a number ways. One is an increased focus on African-Americans, who are twice as likely to receive diagnoses of Alzheimer 9s, chave a very different experience navigating our health system, and different cultural expectations when it comes to caring for elders, Ms. Levad said. , In Liverpool, next on the agenda is exploring options around augmented reality, Ms. Rogers said: using digital technology to recreate 3D object experiences on the screen. cThere 9s a great opportunity there to take objects and experiences into people 9s homes in a different way, she said, noting that they were heading into uncharted territory. cThis is our ambition. ] ",

Technology of Business has garnered opinions from dozens of companies on what they think will be the dominant global tech trends in 2018. Artificial intelligence (AI) dominates the landscape, closely followed, as ever, by cyber-security. But is AI an enemy or an ally? Whether helping to identify diseases and develop new drugs, or powering driverless cars and air traffic management systems, the consensus is that AI will start to deliver in 2018, justifying last year's sometimes hysterical hype. It will make its presence felt almost everywhere.  * [AI early diagnosis could save heart and cancer patients](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42357257?intlink_from_url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/ce1qrvleleqt/artificial-intelligence&link_location=live-reporting-story) AI can sift through vast amounts of digital data, learn and improve, spot patterns we can't hope to see, and hopefully make sensible decisions based on those insights. The key question is how much freedom should we give AI-powered systems to make their own decisions without any human intervention?     ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05sng43.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionFed up with motorway driving?

That's not so easy.  * [Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think?](/news/business-41035201) Yet almost by stealth, AI is infiltrating almost all aspects of our working lives, from machine learning algorithms improving the accuracy of translation software, to call centre chatbots answering our questions. \"AI-powered chatbots will continue to get better at conveying information that can help consumers make better, more informed purchase decisions,\" says Luka Crnkovic-Friis, chief executive of Peltarion, a Swedish AI specialist. Customer experience firm Servion predicts that by 2020, 95% of all customer interactions will involve voice-powered AI, and that 2018 will be the year this really takes off.

J. Walker Smith, executive chairman of Kantar Futures, agrees, saying that \"learning emotional empathy is the final barrier to AI's full-scale market growth\". Talking to machines will become as natural as typing used to be, the tech utopians believe. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google's Home voice- activated assistants are already in many homes, rapidly learning new skills.  * [Amazon's Alexa heads to the workplace](/news/technology-42190140) In the workplace, these digital assistants - think of IBM's Watson - will give employees \"more immediate access to data\" that will lead to \"a reduction in repetitive or administrative tasks in their roles\", say Javier Diez-Aguirre, vice president of corporate marketing at office equipment maker Ricoh Europe.

While the ability to analyse it all in real time using virtually unlimited cloud computing power has accelerated the pace of development. AI still operates according to the rules we set - until we allow it to develop its own rules, of course. But what if those rules and assumptions are inherently biased?  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05rv4fh.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionCan AI keep Marwell Zoo's animals warm?

An example of AI not acting intelligently at all. The old computing maxim \"rubbish in, rubbish out\", still applies.  Cyber-security: 'Weaponised AI' While many cyber-security firms point out AI's potential in combating cyber- attacks - monitoring computer networks in real time for signs of abnormal behaviour, for example - others soberly observe that AI will also be \"weaponised\" by the hackers. \"2018 could be the year we see the first battle of the AI bots,\" warns Dr Adrian Nish, head of threat intelligence at BAE Systems.

He was a bilingual classroom teacher, a school principal and a senior-level administrator in Las Vegas and Tucson. Carranza is going from the largest school district in Texas, with 214,175 students, to the largest in the country, with 1.1 million students. He was superintendent in Houston during Hurricane Harvey and led the effort to get schools reopened after the devastating flooding. He also had to deal with the fallout from a scandal reported by the Houston Chronicle in late 2016 about how Texas education officials had deliberately kept children with disabilities out of special-education programs. Arizona-born Carranza is leaving as the Houston district faces massive budget cuts and after planning to implement some controversial changes, including\\xa0the centralization of the district, where principals had long made their own decisions.

Carranza said in a statement: > It has been an honor and privilege to have served the students of the Houston Independent School District and bring a voice to communities that have historically been underserved. It is with a heavy heart that I announce my departure as I embark on this new journey. I am looking forward to the opportunity of serving the 1.1 million students in New York City.

Redfield, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and co-founder of the [Institute for Human Virology](http://www.ihv.org/ \"institute for human virology baltimore\"). ,  cDr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients, Mr. Azar said. cWe are proud to welcome him as director of the world 9s premier epidemiological agency. , Dr. Redfield, 66, will replace [Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, who resigned in January](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/health/cdc-brenda-fitzgerald- resigns.html) after just six months on the job. Dr. Fitzgerald left amid criticism of her investments with her husband in tobacco and health care companies that posed potential conflicts of interest. , Dr. Redfield oversees clinical care and research at the virology institute, which provides H.I.V. treatment to more than 6,000 patients in the Baltimore- Washington area and more than 1 million people in Africa and the Caribbean. The institute, with an annual budget of more than $105 million, also studies other chronic viral illnesses and cancer. , In his statement, Dr. Azar called Dr. Redfield 9s decades of science and clinical work 4 especially in the field of H.I.V./AIDS 4 cpeerless. He added that the treatment network Dr. Redfield operates in Baltimore for patients with H.I.V. and hepatitis C would help him chit the ground running on a top priority, ccombating the opioid epidemic. , News of Dr. Redfield 9s appointment has revived criticisms about some of his policy stances and research practices that date back to an earlier period in the AIDS epidemic. He came under fire for advocating broad AIDS testing and the screening of military personnel for the virus. , In addition, his research into a potential treatment vaccine led to allegations of data distortion and a military investigation; no evidence of misconduct was found. His record has prompted Senator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, to oppose his appointment, although some advocates for AIDS patients now say they support him for the job. , A graduate of Georgetown University and its School of Medicine, Dr. Redfield did his residency at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, then stayed on as a researcher in the military, focusing on AIDS. In 1996, he launched the virology institute with Dr. Robert C. Gallo, who developed the blood test for H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus.  , Dr. Redfield, 66, has longstanding ties to various government agencies. He served on two advisory panels for the National Institutes of Health from 2002 to 2006, when Mr. Azar was general counsel and then deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human services. Dr. Redfield 9s high profile on AIDS research and policy matters has made him a perennial candidate for the C.D.C. job. He has been a small donor to Republican Party committees, giving about $2,000 in total. , In 2016, the institute was awarded more than $138 million in five-year grants from the C.D.C. to combat H.I.V./AIDS and other health problems in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. It also has a substantial portfolio of corporate-sponsored research, whose underwriters have included Aventis, Gilead, Human Genome Sciences, Merck and Schering. , Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor of Maryland, praised Dr. Redfield. cHe has a wonderful bedside manner and is loving and devoted to his patients, said Ms. Townsend, who served on the institute 9s board. , Terry Lierman, chairman of the institute 9s Board of Advisors, said Dr. Redfield 9s work treating H.I.V. patients who were also addicts made him a great choice for the job. ,  cIn particular, Dr. Redfield has much experience in treating addiction as a co-morbidity to H.I.V. and incorporating addiction treatment into a patient 9s overall primary care, Mr. Lierman said. cThis appointment is refreshingly not about politics, but about quality, competence and compassion. 9 9 , Medical careers run in Dr. Redfield 9s family. Both his parents worked at the National Institutes of Health, and two of his children are doctors. His wife, Joy, is a nurse whom he met while they were delivering babies together. , As the nation 9s public health agency, the C.D.C. is charged with controlling disease outbreaks, ensuring the safety of food and water, and helping reduce the leading causes of death, among them heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. The agency has a budget of more than $7.2 billion, and a staff of more than 12,000 employees working in the United States and around the world. , The C.D.C. was recently in the spotlight when Mr. Azar said he believed the agency should resume research on gun violence, which it drastically cut more than 20 years ago. Dr. Redfield 9s views on gun violence research and other contentious issues such as access to abortion and sexual health education are not yet known. , His work in AIDS research and policy has generated concern over the years, in particular for his call in the mid-1980s to late 1980s for widespread AIDS testing and screening of military recruits for H.I.V. , While pushing for broader AIDS testing during routine exams as a means to contain the epidemic, Dr. Redfield also called for reducing the stigma associated with the disease. At a congressional hearing in August 1987, Dr. Redfield recommended regular testing, at doctor 9s appointments and hospitalizations, as well as for marriage license applicants, and incorporating the test into the practice of medicine, according to news reports. But he also said, cWe have to tell people it 9s anti- American to discriminate against people who have the AIDS virus. , In the early 1990s, Dr. Redfield was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine at presentations and in a report. The investigation led to a correction in some published data, according to documents. , Several high-level colleagues, however, felt the military should have been tougher on Dr. Redfield, who they felt raised false hopes about the efficacy of a treatment vaccine he was developing. At the time, Public Citizen 9s Health Research Group sued to gain the records, and made them public. , In a 1992 letter to Col. Donald Burke, the director of the division of retrovirology, Major Craig W. Hendrix, director of the Air Force HIV program, wrote that the credibility of the military 9s efforts on retroviral research was at risk and under scrutiny. cSevere, painful steps must be taken less we dishonor the honest labors of so many colleagues and patients within our research consortium. We cannot continue to deceive. , In an interview Tuesday, Dr. Hendrix, now a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, recalled the incident, which he now uses as a case study in ethics. ,  cThe facts didn 9t line up, Dr. Hendrix said. cI can 9t know if it was intentional, but I think every scientist has to be the most skeptical of their own data, and the most careful, because nobody else will have all the raw data. , In the letter Senator Murray wrote to President Trump, she mentioned the Army investigation, which criticized Dr. Redfield for a faulty analysis of vaccine trial data, and premature presentation of the information. ,  cThis pattern of ethically and morally questionable behavior leads me to seriously question whether Dr. Redfield is qualified to be the federal government 9s chief advocate and spokesperson for public health, Senator Murray wrote. , But Gregg Gonsalves, an AIDS activist and assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said he was optimistic about Dr. Redfield 9s appointment, noting that many people 9s views on AIDS and other public health issues have evolved over the years, along with the science. ,  cWe don 9t have to be defined by our pasts, but Dr. Redfield has to clarify where he stands now on key issues and place himself firmly in the mainstream of evidence-based public health, Mr. Gonsalves said. , Jesse Milan Jr., president and chief executive of AIDS United, said that Dr. Redfield called on Tuesday to convey that he would embrace the group 9s goals. Those include supporting needle exchanges for drug users, to prevent the spread of H.I.V. through dirty needles, and pre-exposure prophylaxis, the use of an anti-H.I.V. medication to prevent getting the virus. ,  cI heard him commit to our entire H.I.V. prevention toolbox and to supporting health equity for the entire spectrum of marginalized and stigmatized people, Mr. Milan said. cIf he 9s appointed, I can assure you we will hold him to it. , Dr. Redfield did not respond to requests for comment. ] ",

Their solution? Bar employers from asking job applicants what they currently earn, so new salary offers are not based on the previous figure. Laws are already on the books in a handful of jurisdictions, including California, Massachusetts, New York City and Puerto Rico. Similar measures are under consideration in more than 20 other states, as well as at the national level. The aim is to stop a hiring practice that critics say perpetuates the pay gap, since women often start out with lower salaries. \"What these bans are doing is ensuring that employers pay employees for the job they have to do,\" says Kate Nielson, state policy manager for the American Association for University Women, which supports the new laws.    \"There is a real attraction to this kind of policy because it is proactive.\"  Why now? The US has officially banned unequal pay for equal work since 1963, but what counts as equal can be controversial, as highlighted by recent rows in the UK at the BBC and Tesco. And unlike the UK - which now requires large companies to report publicly on pay by gender - the Trump administration recently suspended a rule that would compel firms to report similar data to the government.   * [Gender pay gap: What you need to know](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-42918951)   * [Equal pay day: What is the gender pay gap like where you are?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-england-41805053)   Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The idea has spread rapidly amid mounting frustration in the US over the pay gap  People who campaigned for the law in Massachusetts - which became the first place in the US to approve such a rule in 2016 - said they think the idea has caught on because it is simple and does not punish firms retroactively. \"Instead of taking the traditional approach... we wanted to actually create new standards to make sure that employers and businesses were being proactive,\" says Sasha Goodfriend, president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization for Women. \"It sometimes needs to be redefined in a new way to reignite an age-old conversation.\"  Gender gap On average, women in the US earn about 80% of the amount paid to men - [roughly comparable to the UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-42723960), according to [government statistics](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files /0779dc2f-4a4e-4386-b847-9ae919735acc/gender-pay-inequality----us-congress- joint-economic-committee.pdf). For black and Hispanic women, the gap is even wider. Some of the difference is due to factors like occupation or part-time work. Yet even after allowing for this, women just one year out of college earned about 7% less than men, a gap that widens over time, according to [research by the American Association for University Women](https://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/pdf_download/show_pdf.php?file=The- Simple-Truth).  Image copyrightA Rizo/TOMAS OVALLEImage caption Aileen Rizo sued her employer, which used prior pay to determine her salary  Aileen Rizo, 43, who coached math teachers for a school district in California, said she had not considered the link between the pay gap and salary inquiries - until she encountered it herself. In 2012, she confronted her employer after learning her pay was lower than that of co-workers in the same role. The district said the difference was due to a policy that set salaries based on prior pay, not gender discrimination. \"If you always look at my prior salary, I could never break that barrier,\" says Ms Rizo, who eventually filed a lawsuit. The dispute has not yet been finally resolved, but her case helped to galvanise support for new equal pay laws in California, including the ban on prior pay inquiries. \"I think maybe it's the right time,\" Ms Rizo says. \"The culture is shifting and women are finding their voice and finding empowerment.\"  Sea change The rules require a sea-change in hiring practices, especially for white collar fields. About 95% of more than 100 large and mid-size employers surveyed by human resources consulting firm Korn Ferry in November said they asked about candidates' pay histories.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption A recent survey by Robert Half found that 34% of women tried to negotiate higher salaries, compared to 46% of men  Companies typically offer about 10% above someone's current salary, says Katie Donovan, who founded the consulting firm Equal Pay Negotiations and previously worked in the staffing industry.   * [Gender pay gap: What every woman should know](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-39513573)   * [Important moments in the fight for equal pay](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-37899167)  In some cases, she says firms also use salaries to screen candidates, interpreting high pay as a proxy for competence and responsibility. \"They think it's an objective number when it's anything but,\" says Ms Donovan, who pushed to include the ban on prior pay queries in the Massachusetts law. \"The dirty little secret in hiring, is for the most part we pay people what they're willing to accept.\"  Firms' responses In liberal Massachusetts, advocates worked carefully to get business support for the proposal. Firms elsewhere were sometimes more resistant, worried the measure would induce higher research and costs during hiring.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Hiring experts say they see little sign that pay negotiations are becoming less important  In Philadelphia, the local Chamber of Commerce even sued on behalf of employers that included Comcast, charging that the measure violated free speech grounds, a case that is still being litigated. As the idea gains traction, however, companies are starting to adjust, says David Woolf, a Philadelphia-based partner at the law firm Drinker Biddle, who works on employment issues. \"I don't mean to suggest they like it,\" he says. \"It's just the reality now.\"  Possible drawbacks Ms Donovan and other supporters said they are hopeful the rule is a step toward companies setting salaries based on the job, not the person, noting research that has found women tend to [negotiate less](https://www.roberthalf.com/index.php/blog/compensation-and-benefits/who- most-likely-negotiated-salary) and [are less successful](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22961) when they do. But hiring experts say they see little sign that pay negotiations are becoming less important. Companies are asking candidates how much they want to get paid as a \"fallback\" says Mr Woolf. And if anything, the new rules are likely to prompt pay discussions to start earlier in the hiring process, says Paul McDonald, senior executive director at the staffing firm Robert Half.   * [Six ways to tackle the gender pay gap](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-37164297)   * [Gender pay gap to remain until 2069, report says](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-37460778)  Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, says he thinks the legislation could have other unintended consequences. For example, if job candidates don't volunteer salaries during the discussions, firms are likely to assume their pay is lower than it is.  Image copyrightGetty Images Mr Cappelli says this effect is likely to be especially pronounced for women and other groups that are statistically likely to have lower pay. \"The phrase for this is statistical discrimination,\" he says. \"Now we've got this quirky situation where it's actually likely to make things worse.\"  Practical impact Advocates say it will take a few years of job switching and hiring before they can say whether the measure is meeting its goal. They are not the only parties optimistic about change, however. About two-thirds of companies surveyed by Korn Ferry said they expect the legislation to improve pay equity at their firm by at least a small extent. Bob Wesselkamper, global leader of awards and benefit consulting at Korn Ferry, says many US companies have not examined the issue in recent years and may be overestimating the legislation's effects. Even with that caveat, he adds: \"I firmly believe that there will be organizations that will benefit ... and become a more fair and equitable environment because of this legislation.\" Ms Rizo and others add that they know this idea is not a silver bullet. They're also pushing for better accommodations for pregnancy, stronger sexual harassment laws and paid family and sick leave, which is not a national requirement in the US. \"I've seen a lot of progress,\" says Ms Rizo. \"There's still a lot of work to do\"  ] ",

      "article": "[  If higher education is under attack from restrictive U.S. immigration policies, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology considers it a personal battle. Rafael Reif, an immigrant from Venezuela, has emerged as a vocal critic of President Donald Trump in the past year, initially responding to the White House travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. Reif, 67, has spoken out more recently against a tax overhaul that includes a levy on endowments of large, private colleges.  cWhat happens, thanks to these immigrants, are places like MIT help the American economy -- that has to be understood, d\\xa0Reif said in a wide- ranging interview to air Wednesday on Bloomberg TV. cThe whole nation will hurt with this perception that we are not as welcoming as we used to be.  Biotech Center     MIT has become the center of a booming biotech economy in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Graduates have started more than 30,000 companies that generate $2 trillion of revenue annually, he said. Last year, the university completed a $750 million deal with the federal government to purchase a 14-acre tract in Kendall Square that will be transformed to support even more startups, Reif said. MIT filed seven amicus briefs last year opposing the travel ban, which the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to take effect last month. Travel to the U.S is restricted from eight countries, including Venezuela. The university also filed briefs in support of a court challenge to Trump 9s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. as children. Reif,\\xa0who moved to the U.S. to attend Stanford University in 1974, said he believes the policies will harm the ability of top schools like MIT to attract the best students from around the world.

      "article": "[   cBlack Panther depicts the dignity and value of black lives on the big screen, breaking box office records and driving a celebration of blackness that I have not experienced since the 2008 election of Barack Obama. The film centers on the uncolonized African nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced, modern, and self-sufficient nation of Pan African Black glory, with residents drenched in vibranium-laced cocoa butter.  The best part of Wakanda? Wakanda doesn 9t need allies.  While cBlack Panther is almost entirely disinterested in validating the participation of whiteness in the story of T 9Challa and the fate of Wakanda, it offers a model for how white people can resist the urge to simply be allies in the cause of justice and rather be useful without having to be center stage or praised.  Over the last few years of movements for equality, many white people and people with privilege have [sought to become allies](http://time.com/4905850 /charlottesville-white-allies-stand-against-hate/), people who protect and speak up for those who are oppressed and marginalized. Allyship, while seemingly helpful, often devolves into [focusing on white stories](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/health/social-media-race-debate- allies-trnd/index.html), diminishing the struggle of people of color. Frankly, allyship is by nature [self-congratulatory](https://www.theroot.com/it-s -official-white-allies-are-the-worst-wypipo-in-the-1797481427) and dependent on the praise of the marginalized. Wakanda had no use or praise for a special white savior (in fact, they saved the white people), which adds to what makes cBlack Panther so revolutionary.  > Being an ally is less about the liberation of people of color and more about showering the ally with praise.  Void of the colonizing impulse and experience of white supremacy, Wakanda is free from the need for a white savior. cBlack Panther reflects this reality through its limited engagement with white people in the film, with only 3 white people having speaking roles: a museum employee who isn 9t around very long, a short-lived villain and CIA agent Everett Ross, a diminutive sidekick at best.  At no point is he a necessary character. He heroically jumps in front of a bullet for Nakia, but these black women, who run this entire narrative and save men over and and over again with advanced technology, can cure bullet wounds overnight, begging the question did she really need to be saved? And Ross, because of the bullet he takes, becomes less of a hero and more of a burden.  Upon arriving in Wakanda, Ross finds the technology that he has known his whole life in the U.S. is inferior to Wakanda and that a young black women, who greets him as ccolonizer, has saved his life. He does not defensively cry out cnot all white people in response to her criticism, but rather takes it and moves on. He ends up in Wakanda because he needs help, not because he is a hero. He is mildly helpful and receives no accolades.  In the film, he turns away from cultural traditions that aren 9t his to participate in and it is clear that his presence doesn 9t imply that his opinion is needed or necessary. When he makes cultural missteps, he shuts his mouth (he is literally [silenced by barking](https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/we-need-to-start-barking-at- white-people-who-speak-out-1823131315)), manages his defensiveness and waits for a time to be useful.  Even his final heroism isn 9t about accolades. After being given a mission to keep advanced weapons technology from leaving Wakanda, he is thrown into a scenario where his incompetence is only mitigated by a black women in his ear telling him exactly what to do after putting him in a scenario that she knew he could be helpful in. He does the thing he is asked and that entitles him to no thanks or special titles.  The lesson of cBlack Panther for white allies is this: They must learn to be the sidekick, to be at the fringe, to give up power, to have people of color in their ears directing them on how to be useful in fighting for the cause of justice.  At the end of the day, Ross 9 redemption is that he keeps engaging over and over again and is useful when he needs to be under the leadership and glory of black women. He is a model of a co-conspirator, one who, however he ended up in the room, turned from the posture of defensiveness, fragility and superiority and instead became a useful agent in the cause.  > It is the epitome of white supremacy culture to need a white hero in order to celebrate the liberation of people of color.  White allies in film and media are typically framed as sympathetic, cost- bearing heroes, ahead of their time and paragons to emulate ([see Al Harrison](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hidden-figures-and-the- diversity-conversation-we-arent-having_us_58adc9bee4b0d0a6ef470492), cHidden Figures d). It is the epitome of white supremacy culture to need a white hero in order to celebrate and engage with the liberation and courage of people of color.  Allyship often comes with an invisible and unearned badge that gives a pass (or at least entitlement) to a person 9s own problematic racism and moves the conversation from the oppressed to the one who intervened. The work becomes less about the liberation of people of color and more about showering the ally with praise.  The (unfortunate) reality is, we don 9t live in Wakanda, there is not a place void of the impacts of colonialism, but the principals for white allies stand: If you are going to be here with us, be useful. If you want to speak, do so when you are needed and in the appropriate place and time. If you want to participate, do so in things that are meant for you.

(Maggie Beadle Photography) In the abortion debate, Down syndrome has become a rallying cry of sorts among both antiabortion and\\xa0abortion rights camps. It 9s a debate that will continue to rage, as recent legislation has passed in North Dakota, Ohio, Indiana and Louisiana banning abortion for a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The condition, in which a fetus develops from fertilization with an extra copy of the 21st chromosome, is the most common chromosomal abnormality, occurring once in every 700 live births. And it 9s something I 9ve learned a lot about since the prenatal diagnosis of my third child, who is now almost\\xa03 years old. This month\\xa0The Washington Post [published a column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-silenced-majority-of- women-who-would-abort-a-fetus-with-down-syndrome/2018/03/16/6590579e-293d-11e8 -874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.cd4d3fde8adb)\\xa0in response to this recent legislation, defending a woman 9s the right to terminate a pregnancy with the Down syndrome diagnosis, a choice the author said she would have made had she faced the decision. The response to her piece was as emotional and complicated as one might imagine. We in the Down syndrome community are already exhausted by this public conversation, which feels very personal and painful, and surely any parent whose child suddenly became an cissue could empathize. But it 9s not the abortion component that fatigues us most, though this conversation often gets stuck in the cpro-life or cpro-choice divide. _[[ Babies with Down syndrome are put on center stage in the U.S. abortion fight ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/03/05/down- syndrome-babies-are-taking-center-stage-in-the-u-s-abortion- fight/?utm_term=.06de8a3baa71)]_ Today, as we celebrate World Down Syndrome Day, many in the DS community would love to see this debate move away from the frenzied desperation of abortion discourse and toward a broader, more holistic dialogue. It starts by searching for our soul and the soul of our society. We live in a culture that holds contempt for weakness, and our derision masquerades as progress. Despite the fact that people with Down syndrome are living longer, going to college and achieving more than ever before, a culture that defines human worth by what a person can contribute, produce or enjoy is always going to leave people behind. It would do us good to begin to admit our collective failure to protect the weakest among us. And repentance begins with listening to the voices at the center of this debate. When we step into conversation with those on the margins of society, their stories will lead us to curiosity, empathy and a more vibrant consciousness. _[[ Boy Scouts discriminated against Utah teenager with Down syndrome, lawsuit says ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/21/boy- scouts-discriminated-against-utah-teenager-with-down-syndrome-lawsuit- says/?utm_term=.bfa5640766d1)]_ What makes it into opinion columns only continues to feed an already false perception of intellectual differences and value. Human beings with Down syndrome are acknowledged as cute, or loved by their families, or capable of living a fulfilling life. None of these portrayals is wrong, but if left alone, a person with Down syndrome begins to look like a caricature, worthy only for her cuteness or for the shallow positive feelings her life can provide those of us who are neurotypical. But deeming a life valuable because a person is happy or cute isn 9t merely shallow. It 9s dangerous. It should disturb us deeply when anyone fails to acknowledge our full humanity or makes a claim to know who among us is worthy of life 4 and who isn 9t. My friend Jeff, who is LGBTQ, recently shared with me his fear that one day we might discover a genetic code and offer prenatal testing for sexual orientation. What would be our reaction if the possibility that a fetus would identify as LGBTQ became a common reason for the termination of pregnancies? Imagine our righteous anger on behalf of an entire group of people who have every right to love and feel and experience the world and bless it with their existence. Perhaps one day we will have the technology to test for every genetic variant our human bodies can pass along to our offspring. Perhaps we 9ll test for autism, for artistic skill, for physical attraction. And when we can, where will we draw the line? Who among us doesn 9t have traits that could be seen by some as undesirable? The question then becomes, what sort of human is desirable enough, and what sort isn 9t? Disability continues to be misunderstood, and the debate over abortion rights brings this contempt to the surface. The truth is this: We like to think that we are advanced, socially evolved people. Yet our society remains deeply afraid of difference, and often we mistake difference for deficiency. Until we take time to know, listen to and value those who experience the world differently than we do, we will fail to be fully human. How a society chooses to embrace and learn from the marginalized among us says a great deal about who we are. I like to think we 9re capable of more. _Micha Boyett is the author of cFound: A Story of Questions, Grace, and Everyday Prayer and a co-host of[The Lucky Few podcast](https://www.theluckyfewpodcast.com/), which shares stories and advocates for people with Down syndrome.

      "article": "[  [Bill and Melinda Gates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-gates-foundation- giving-away-a-fortune/), as the world's top philanthropists, are rethinking their work in America as they confront what they consider their unsatisfactory track record on schools, the country's growing inequity and a president they disagree with more than any other. In an interview with The Associated Press, the couple said they're concerned about President Donald Trump's \"America first\" worldview. They've made known their differences with the president and his party on issues including foreign aid, taxes and protections for immigrant youth in the country illegally. And they said they're now digging into the layers of U.S. poverty that they haven't been deeply involved with at the national level, including employment, race, housing, mental health, incarceration and substance abuse. \"We are not seeing the mobility out of poverty in the same way in the United States as it used to exist,\" Melinda Gates said. [The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/melinda- gates-on-making-a-successful-life/) is studying these topics with no plans yet for any particular initiatives, though it has done related work at home in Washington state on a much smaller scale. Last year, it funded a grant for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities to look into state and federal policies that can reduce poverty. Once the world's richest man, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has marked a decade since transitioning away from the tech giant to focus on philanthropy. He said he's had two meetings with Mr. Trump, where they discussed innovation in education, energy and health 4 including vaccines, which Mr. Trump has voiced skepticism about. \"I got, both times, to talk about the miracle of vaccines and how those are good things,\" Bill Gates said. Melinda Gates, who left her job at Microsoft to raise their three children before turning to the foundation full-time, has lately embraced her role as a public figure more boldly. She called out Mr. Trump's behavior, saying the president has a responsibility to be a good role model when he speaks and tweets, and that his verbal attacks don't belong in the public discourse. \"You just have to go look in Twitter to see the disparaging comments over and over and over again about women and minorities,\" Melinda Gates said. \"That's just not what I believe. It's not the world that I see.\" Mr. Trump has said he's a counterpuncher who goes after people when they go after him, only 10 times harder. Taking a more reflective review of their work than in years past, the couple in their annual letter published Tuesday also answered 10 questions critics often ask them. They acknowledge it's unfair that they have so much wealth and influence but reject the notion that they're imposing their values on other cultures. \"Behind the scenes, these are the tough, tough questions that people are asking us, and yeah, we have to wrestle with them ourselves,\" Melinda Gates said in the Feb. 1 interview. Since 2000, the Seattle-based private foundation has amassed an endowment worth over $40 billion, which includes a large portion of billionaire investor Warren Buffett's fortune. The Gates Foundation has given money to various programs in more than 100 countries, as well as in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Their approach to giving has shifted the philanthropy world as a whole. They've been criticized for prescribing how the money is spent and then expecting tangible proof their investments work. About 75 percent of the foundation's resources are dedicated to global health and development. Bill Gates said they're proudest of their efforts to help eradicate polio and curb the number of child deaths, calling those global health improvements a miracle. But he concedes the same level of progress didn't happen in the U.S. with their strategy of chasing equity through education reform. U.S. education initiatives are a distant second funding priority for the foundation, but the $450 million the Gateses spend annually on the issue makes them the top funders of schools reform in America. They've been major supporters of charter schools and also pushed Common Core education standards, teacher evaluation systems that factored in student test scores and a smaller schools model 4 highly polarizing education policy reforms that didn't dramatically change student outcomes but made the Gateses deeply unpopular in some communities. \"It's in taking all of those lessons and saying, 'OK, but did they reach the majority of the school districts? Did they scale and change the system for low-income and minority kids writ large, at scale?' And the answer when we looked at it, it was no,\" Melinda Gates said. Christopher Lubienski, an education policy expert who studies philanthropy, said he found the couple's honesty refreshing but noted their foundation's overall approach means it will continue to systematically influence education reform. Lubienski, who said he has not sought nor received money from Gates, also noted that by turning their attention to poverty, the Gateses are tackling the \"really big elephant in the room\" when it comes to student achievement. \"It's also a much bigger, more expensive and politically stickier area to attack than simply changing the structure of schools,\" Lubienski said. The Gateses say they're going in a less prescriptive direction on U.S. education by funding efforts through regional networks of schools, which will lean more heavily on educators at the local level. They also intend to support new curriculum development and charters catering to students with special needs. The foundation will spend $1.7 billion on education over the next five years, as K-12 will remain their primary focus in the U.S. But as they take stock of the country 4 from the West Coast's growing income gap to the generations of racial inequities in the American South 4 the Gateses say they're looking at myriad problems that hinder children in the classroom. \"Poverty is like education, where there's not enough philanthropic resources to take on responsibility, but if you can show how to have a lot more impact, then the policies will benefit from that,\" Bill Gates said.  ] ",

A [report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/tt_hard_history_american_slavery.pdf) by the Southern Poverty Law Center concluded that schools are not adequately teaching the history of slavery in particular. Despite these laments, Americans remain fundamentally divided on the teaching of black history. That 9s not new. What is new is the growing polarization of Democrats and Republicans on this issue. **A new poll shows the same old racial divide** In a February [YouGov/Economist Poll](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/5qt1ka60gv/econTabReport.pdf), 85 percent of African Americans and 32 percent of whites said that there 9s not enough black history in our schools. This large racial divide isn 9t surprising. The last time that major polling firms asked about teaching black history, two polls in 2000 showed that African Americans were over 40 points more likely than whites to want more black history taught in schools. **But the partisan divide is new** In the February poll, Democrats and Republicans were miles apart: 67 percent of Democrats thought our schools should be teaching more black history, compared with just 10 percent of Republicans. This divide, unlike the racial divide, is more recent. The left graph below shows that in 2000, Democrats and Republicans were about 20 points apart.

In 1964, less than a few years after IBM had launched the first solid-state mainframe computer, \"The Twilight Zone\" ran a skit titled \"The Brain Center at Whipple's\" -- where Mr. Whipple, the owner of a vast manufacturing corporation replaced all his factory workers with a room-sized computing machine. Mr. Whipple's economic justification for his \"X109B14 modified transistorized totally automated machine\" could just as well be applied to AI: \"It costs 2 cents an hour to run ... it lasts indefinitely ... it gets no wrinkles, no arthritis, no blocked arteries ... two of them replace 114 men who take no coffee breaks, no sick leaves, no vacations with pay.\" In the show, Whipple's machine quickly replaced everyone from the plant's workers to its foremen to all the secretaries. The story was prescient and many of its fictionalized fears in time came true: Most of the large manufacturing plants were indeed shut down; secretaries and typists mostly became obsolete; and the jobs that created the American middle- class were all eventually outsourced. Much of this computer-driven automation replaced low-skilled easily routinizable functions. But AI is different.

      "article": "[  Eight years ago, Belgian brewer\\xa0Urbain Coutteau tasted a batch of his\\xa0flagship beer Pannepot, a 10 percent ABV unfiltered, unpasteurized dark ale. As\\xa0owner\\xa0of De Struise Brouwers, he\\xa0immediately realized that some of the wrong hop varietals had been used during brewing and,\\xa0while the result yielded an interesting profile, it was too much of a flavor departure from the original to be released as Pannepot. Rather than dump the several batches affected, he\\xa0thought to distill the beer into a spirit 4much the way wine is the base for brandy. cOur vision was very simple, Coutteau says. cThe distillate would have to be as drinkable and complex as its base beer Pannepot, with a similar flavor profile. This turned out to be easier said than done. In layman 9s terms, spirit distillation is the process of separating alcohol from water by heating a fermented solution 4beer, in this case 4and condensing and collecting the alcohol-rich vapors. cThe more literature we read, the more we became convinced that the end-product quality could easily be affected downwards by taking wrong distillation procedures and/or cuts, he says.     They ended up collaborating with Distillerie de Bierc\\xe9e just two hours distance from the brewery.\\xa0Over two days, 20,000 liters of 2010 Pannepot was run through their still, with just 6.5 percent\\xa0of the total volume becoming collected spirit. That liquid was then transferred to a miscellany of different oak barrels for extended maturation. ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iV2I6PMG9fWk/v1/60x-1.jpg) Mikkeller 9s Black Alcohol gift box. Source: Vendor  cThe interaction between the spirit and the natural chemicals 4cellulose, hemicellulose and lignine 4contained in the oak wood add flavor to our distillate, says Coutteau. cTemperature changes provoke expansion and contraction of the barrel 9s wood, which effectively allows the spirit inside to breathe in tiny amounts of new oxygen. This natural occurrence helps leach out valuable flavors from residual spirit previously held in the used barrels. Spirits from grapes are often called cbrandy, d\\xa0and (aged)\\xa0spirits of grains\\xa0are often called cwhiskey, d\\xa0but Coutteau\\xa0wasn 9t satisfied with that limited vocabulary.\\xa0 cWe kind of felt trapped inside these guidelines, he says.\\xa0 cSo we decided to simply call our spirit 8Pannepot Distillate. 9 d\\xa0 Now, after years aging in wood and bottled at 42 percent ABV, the first Pannepot Distillate is ready for release soon in Belgium 4coming from Speyside whisky oak. Fully matured, it pours a fine, straw-yellow color, thanks to the wood 9s influence, and is best enjoyed neat after a meal. It features aromas of dill and sage, with light accents of apple, pear, and marzipan. On the palate, it 9s medium-dry, with elegant flavors of mirabelle plums, vanilla, and subtle wood. It 9s a\\xa0beautifully novel genre-defying gem that drinks somewhere between eau de vie and Scotch.

You can't do better than Stanford University, according to Princeton Review, publisher of the annually updated book \"[Colleges that Pay You Back](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50 ---colleges-that-pay-you-back).\" Though Stanford's sticker price is a mind-numbing $63,996 for tuition, books, fees, room and board, the university provides an average of $45,318 in need- based aid to undergraduates, bringing the real cost down to a more manageable $18,678 annually. The average Stanford grad has less than $22,000 in debt at graduation.\\xa0 But what gives Stanford a great return on your college investment -- in addition to a superior education and rich experiential learning options -- is that the average graduate earns a median salary of $73,300 to start and some $140,400 by mid-career.\\xa0 \"Students and parents are focused now more than ever on college costs and making sure that they aren't overwhelmed with debt,\" said Robert Franek, editor at Princeton Review and one of the co-authors of the book. \"There are schools that are doing an outstanding job of making sure they address that concern and giving a lot of aid in the process.\"    Editors at Princeton Review looked at 40 different data points -- from student and parent reviews to alumni involvement, graduation rates and a graduate's career trajectory -- at more than 650 public and private colleges nationwide. The book features the 200 with the highest return on investment.\\xa0 \"These schools were bona fide standouts,\" said Franek. \"They offer stellar academics, generous aid awards and provide all of their undergrads with career services and a lifetime of alumni connections.\" All of the top 10 colleges on the list are private, but their net cost of attendance was often lower than the cost of a comparable state university, thanks to generous grant-based aid packages.\\xa0 \"Never let the sticker cost scare you,\" Franek added. The other top 10:\\xa0  **Princeton University** , ranked second, has a $66,645 annual price tag. But the school gives the average freshman nearly $50,000 in scholarships. The school's aid program is so generous, that only 18 percent of Princeton's graduates have debt at graduation, and among those, the average debt is a mere $8,908.  **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** , doesn't provide as much aid. However, MIT grads' starting median salaries are among the highest in the country, at $81,500. That makes the median debt at graduation of $24,954 easily manageable.  **California Institute of Technology** , at No. 4, has an all-in cost of $66,027, but it provides the average freshman with $44,074 in scholarships and grants. Grads' starting median salary: $78,800.  **The Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art** rounds out the top five. The school, which traditionally provided free education to all qualified applicants, hit its own financial crisis in 2014 and now charges tuition and fees that are comparable to the rest of these private colleges. However, aid packages remain generous, leaving the average graduate with less than $22,000 of debt.\\xa0  **The rest of the top 10:\\xa0**  * Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California   * Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire   * Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts   * Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut   * Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts  Notably, Princeton Review also created subsets for colleges with the best internships, the best alumni networks, the best financial aid and the best career placement.

The [BBC said Friday](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42827333) that six of its TV and radio presenters had agreed to reduced salaries, and that \"there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course.\" The network did not say whether it had already increased any female staffers' pay in an effort to redress the imbalance.  * [Why gender pay bias lawsuit vs. Google is a \"bid deal\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-lawsuit-gender-pay-gap-nicholas-thompson/)  \"We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced,\" the BBC said in a written statement. \"These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience.

      "article": "[ If the New York City school system, with its 1.1 million students, were its own metropolis, it would be the 10th largest in the country, bigger than Austin, Indianapolis or San Francisco. And starting next month, there will be a new mayor in town. , [Richard A. Carranza](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/nyregion/nyc-schools- chancellor-carranza.html) will become chancellor of the system, with its 75,000 teachers and 1,800 schools, on [April 2](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/nyregion/carranza-schools-chancellor- start- april-2.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Felizabeth-a.-harris&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection), taking on a job that is organizationally complex, intensely political 4 in a word, daunting. , But Mr. Carranza comes to the position with only modest big-district experience on his r\\xe9sum\\xe9, making it difficult to judge the skills and accomplishments he will bring to the job. He spent seven years in San Francisco, first as a deputy superintendent and then leading the district, but there are just 14 public high schools in San Francisco. In New York, there are more than 400. Then he ran the schools in Houston, which is a larger system, but Mr. Carranza 9s time there was so short that graduation rates from his first year in office have yet to be released. ,  cYou come in with a learning curve and you start to implement change, and then you 9re gone, Rhonda Skillern-Jones, the president of the Houston school board, said of Mr. Carranza 9s legacy. cThere wasn 9t time to make a major overhaul or make a mark even, but there also wasn 9t time to mess anything up. , Before Mayor Bill de Blasio made his choice, he said he would pick someone who would hew closely to the agenda set during his first term by Chancellor Carmen Fari\\xf1a. Mr. de Blasio 9s initial selection of Alberto M. Carvalho, superintendent of the Miami-Dade County schools, took some by surprise. Mr. Carvalho had focused on increasing school choice through magnet programs and some charter schools 4 not Mr. de Blasio 9s priority. But he was also a career educator who had demonstrated strong results in increasing graduation rates and was hailed as a shrewd choice. , But after Mr. Carvalho 9s very public about-face in [turning the job down](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/nyregion/carvalho-new-york-schools- chancellor.html), the mayor seems to have reverted to a more familiar character. , In San Francisco, Mr. Carranza championed an effort to change discipline practices, a path Ms. Fari\\xf1a and Mr. de Blasio have taken as well, and suspensions were reduced by half during his four years as superintendent. In Houston, he started a program called Achieve 180, aimed at improving low- performing schools, which is similar in its approach to Mr. de Blasio 9s [Renewal Schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/nyregion/de-blasio- unveils-new-plans-for-troubled-schools-in-new-york.html) program. The Renewal program has [shown mixed results](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/nyregion /new-york-city-will-close-or-merge-19-schools-most-from-renewal-program.html) so far, while for [Achieve 180](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston- texas/houston/article/District-trumpets-launch-of-180-plan-11944994.php), which is still in its first year, it is too soon to tell. , Asked what had attracted the mayor to Mr. Carranza, Dean Fuleihan, first deputy mayor in New York, who was deeply involved in the chancellor search, referred to the focus of his career. cFrom the moment he walks in a classroom, he 9s in an urban setting with largely minority kids, Mr. Fuleihan said. Mr. Carranza 9s commitment to education, he continued, was capparent through each step of his professional career. , At the March 5 news conference announcing his hiring, Mr. Carranza said there was cno daylight between himself and mayor on their beliefs, and for a mayor who hopes to see schools as a key part of his legacy, that was surely appealing. But Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, also seemed compelled by Mr. Carranza 9s life story. , The grandson of immigrants from Mexico, Mr. Carranza, 51, grew up in Tucson; his mother was a hairdresser, his father a sheet-metal worker. The family spoke Spanish at home, and he learned English in public school. Mr. Carranza, an accomplished mariachi musician, worked his way through college at the University of Arizona, cgigging, he said. He earned a masters in education from Northern Arizona University and has done doctoral coursework at Northern Arizona and Nova Southeastern Universities. , Mr. Carranza has a twin brother, Reuben, who has found success in a very different field: He is a partner at Luxury Brand Partners, a company that makes beauty products carried at high-end department stores like Barneys. , Like Ms.[ Fari\\xf1a](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/nyregion/carmen- farina-nyc-schools-retire.html), the departing chancellor, Mr. Carranza is a lifelong educator. He has worked in school systems for 27 years, starting as a bilingual social studies and mariachi music teacher at Pueblo Magnet High School in Tucson, where he went on to become principal. Next, his career took him to Las Vegas, where he oversaw 66 schools and 66,000 students as a region superintendent. Then, on to San Francisco, where he was appointed deputy superintendent for instruction, innovation and social justice in 2009. , In 2012, he became San Francisco 9s superintendent. Norman Yee, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco and a former president of the city 9s Board of Education, described Mr. Carranza as well liked and effective. ,  cHe didn 9t come in saying, 8I know how to do it the right way and everything else is wrong, 9 Mr. Yee said. cHe had a good sense of what was working and what was not working 4 and getting rid of what was not working. , While Mr. de Blasio 9s relationships with charter schools in New York have often been adversarial, Dave Levin, co-founder of the national charter network KIPP, said that Mr. Carranza was supportive when KIPP wanted to start a high school in San Francisco. cHe was really helpful to us in getting it open, in getting public facilities, being supportive of it even through opposition, Mr. Levin said. , During Mr. Carranza 9s time as deputy superintendent and superintendent, San Francisco saw some measurable success. Graduation rates rose by seven percentage points, and the gap narrowed between the graduation rates of black and Hispanic students and the rates of their white and Asian peers. But he failed to fix a persistent and glaring failure in the district: African- Americans in the city have long scored among the lowest in California on standardized tests. , In 2016, the year that Mr. Carranza left San Francisco, 19 percent of African- American students were at grade level in English and 13 percent in math, according to a [report](https://reports.innovateschools.org/san-francisco- schools-report-2017-home/2017-sf-schools-paradox-great-jobs-out-of-reach/) by Innovate Public Schools, a nonprofit in the Bay Area. , Also during his time in San Francisco, an employee who had been passed over for a leadership position [sued the district](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-rejects-bias- allegations-new-schools-chancellor-article-1.3866010), saying that Mr. Carranza created a hostile work environment for women, and that he retaliated against her after she saw him flirt with a woman who was not his wife. The suit was settled. , Olivia Lapeyrolerie, the spokeswoman for the de Blasio administration, said City Hall was aware of the suit before hiring Mr. Carranza. cWe 9re confident that the allegation is completely false, she said. cMr. Carranza was never named in the suit nor was he involved in the settlement. , San Francisco has a big name, but with 56,000 students it is tiny compared to New York. New York City 9s District 2, which includes several Manhattan neighborhoods, alone had 64,000 students last school year. There are 32 such districts in the city. ,  cI went to look at the number and said, 8Oh my goodness, 9 said Aaron Pallas, chairman of the Department of Education Policy at Columbia University 9s Teachers College. cGoing to a system that 9s 20 times larger, in many industries you don 9t think of someone moving into a C.E.O. role that is that large of a jump. , The districts Mr. Carranza led have not attracted the national buzz of places like Washington, D.C., or even smaller school systems like Newark 9s, but he has been courted by big cities before. In 2015, he was in the running to lead the Los Angeles Unified School District. An [article](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-supt- names-20151211-story.html) in The Los Angeles Times said his focuses in San Francisco on reducing suspensions and expanding access to technology were priorities in Los Angeles, as well. But Mr. Carranza removed himself from the competition, [saying](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/administration /la-me-ln-carranza-withdraws-for-la-supt-20160104-story.html) he wanted to stay on in San Francisco. , Then in 2016, he moved on to Houston. Greg Meyers, a former member of the Houston school board who was involved in hiring Mr. Carranza, said that chis drive toward equity, which the board took to be heartfelt, cwas something that really stood out. , In Houston, Mr. Carranza took over a district four times as large as San Francisco 9s, one that has presented him with a long list of challenges. It faces a $115 million budget shortfall and a potential takeover by the state 9s education agency because it failed to improve chronically low- performing schools. Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on school buildings and the city 9s neighborhoods, diminished enrollment and threatened property values, which could mean less money for the district. , Mr. Carranza also reported to a nine-member school board where each member is elected by a separate district, which meant their interests could often be at odds. ,  cI think he really, really struggled to define where it was he wanted to take Houston, said Anna Eastman, a former president of the Houston school board who was on the board during Mr. Carranza 9s first year. cI think it 9s hard for anyone to serve in that role with a board that is not really united around a common vision. , The central goals Mr. Carranza articulated in Houston revolved around giving poor students a better shot. One of his major, and most controversial, plans involved making changes to the city 9s magnet-school programs by giving some preference to children from low-income families and eliminating many of the test-score and academic requirements. Houston 9s high-performing magnet schools are dominated by white middle-class families, and factions of the board are fierce defenders of the current rules. , Another significant proposal was a change to the way schools were funded, which would take some discretion away from principals but provide a minimum level of staffing at every school. Neither the funding nor the magnet changes have yet been approved. Mr. Carranza 9s initial magnet proposal, which called for cutting funding to many of the programs, angered parents and [was withdrawn](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/article/HISD- leaders-back-off-plan-for-deep-cuts-to-11171470.php) **.** , Mr. Fuleihan, Mr. de Blasio 9s deputy mayor, said that while 18 months 4 Mr. Carranza 9s time in Houston 4 was a short tenure, the mayor found the vision Mr. Carranza outlined there to be appealing. Mr. Fuleihan also cited Mr. Carranza 9s response to Hurricane Harvey, after which he quickly reopened [schools](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/schools-reopen-in- houston-buoying-hope-for-recovery/2017/09/11/fd25bc48-971b-11e7-87fc- c3f7ee4035c9_story.html?utm_term=.8f5854d12e04), as evidence of his management skills, especially in light of bungled responses after other storms, like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. ,  cHow you respond to those things, and how calmly you do it, and how you put things together, Mr. Fuleihan said of what New York officials saw in Mr. Carranza 9s crisis response. cI think that 9s very telling about how you can handle a school system like New York City. , Mr. Fuleihan also pointed out that for any new chancellor, New York would be a big jump. The second-largest district in the country, Los Angeles, serves 640,000 students, about 460,000 fewer than New York. , Nonetheless, others found Mr. Carranza 9s record of accomplishment lacking.

Last year, that meant lobbying the government on employment regulations while being sued for alleged discrimination. The world 9s second-largest software company spent an estimated $9 million on lobbying, which included pressing Congress and the Department of Labor on issues relating to employment regulations while the department [sued](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20170118-0 \"Click to view webpage.\") Oracle for allegedly paying white men more than other workers with the same titles. The company also pressed lawmakers on the department 9s budget while the suit progressed, according to lobbying data compiled by Bloomberg. The pay discrimination case, which also alleges that Oracle favored Asian applicants for technical roles, is scheduled for a June hearing. The allegations placed Oracle at the nexus of years-long debates regarding the wage gap between men and women and the push for greater ethnic diversity throughout the tech industry.     The Labor Department 9s lawsuit, cfiled three days before the end of the last administration, is entirely without merit and was filed without a single complainant, said Ken Glueck, a senior vice president at Oracle. cThere is a very broad, ongoing effort from nearly the entire business community to communicate to Congress how (the department) is incorrectly and inappropriately abusing its authority.

      "article": "[  [American Express Co.](/quote/AXP:US \"Bloomberg Intelligence Company Primer\") will disclose data on its gender pay gap by the end of the year, according to a shareholder activist that 9s been pushing Wall Street to release the information. The credit-card company pledged to report to shareholders by the end of 2018 any findings on pay disparities, Arjuna Capital said Wednesday in a statement. New York-based AmEx said in a memo to employees that it regularly reviews pay policies to make sure they support pay equality and transparency.  cBased on the most recent comprehensive pay analysis we conducted with a third-party consulting firm, we are confident that our colleagues are compensated equitably, regardless of gender, the company said in the memo. cThe review found no evidence of bias in our compensation processes and indicated we were effectively at parity.     AmEx 9s decision, which came after pressure from Arjuna, follows similar moves by Mastercard Inc. and most of the biggest U.S. banks. All of them reported that women and men were paid substantially the same amount, but none of the companies said how they calculated the figures and all were adjusted for factors such as seniority and job role.  JPMorgan, Citigroup JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. all have said this year that they paid women roughly 99 percent of what men earn. Women make up 50 percent of American Express 9s work force and only 30 percent of managers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. gender pay gap has been stuck at around 20 percent for the past decade, according to the National Women 9s Law Center.  cWomen are still 20 percent more likely to leave a career in finance than any other industry -- that 9s bad for business and it 9s bad for investors, said Arjuna Capital managing partner Natasha Lamb, who filed a shareholder proposal seeking the pay disclosure at American Express and eight other companies this year. Calling equal pay ca critical first step to retaining top talent, Arjuna withdrew its proposal in response to AmEx 9s pledge. In her withdrawal letter, Lamb said AmEx 9s review will include base, bonus and equity compensation, and the company will adjust pay to get to 100 percent equality. It will also disclose its methodology, according to Lamb.     While some analysts have questioned banks 9 assertions about a 1 percent pay gap, cthese companies along with a handful of tech and consumer firms, are at the leading edge\" in U.S. gender pay equity, Lamb said.  cWith assurances that women will be paid fairly, we can focus more confidently on the next step: moving women into higher paying leadership positions, she said in an email.  _ 4 With assistance by Jennifer Surane_  ] ",

Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, [published the advice](https://www.isc.co.uk/media-enquiries/news-press-releases-statements /good-exam-results-are-made-in-the-easter-holidays/) on the council's website. He said: \"That may seem a lot, but the students who get the best grades will be working this hard.\" But teachers and other experts said it was \"unrealistic\" and could put too much pressure on students. Mr Lenon, who retired as headmaster of Harrow School in 2011, offered five tips which included starting at 9am and working for no more than two hours at a time before taking a break.    He said: \"The best GCSE and A-level results don't go to the cleverest students - they go to those who revised in the Easter holidays.\"  'Work-life balance' His revision schedule would mean 100 hours of work over 14 days in the Easter holiday, with repeat sessions in the summer term and before the exam. Stephen Cumper, a teacher from Belfast, said the advice was \"complete nonsense\". \"Children need to have a work-life balance,\" he said. Colleen Shelley, a teacher in a private girls school in Hertfordshire, said: \"That's absolutely not acceptable. It's not realistic. \"We as adults don't function like that in a work environment. Work should be intermittent - revise in moderation and take breaks.\" Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a psychology professor at University College London who researches the adolescent brain, said teenagers were already under a lot of stress. [She said on Twitter: ](https://twitter.com/sjblakemore/status/979720705007747072)\"This generation of young people are under massive pressure, academically, socially... I'm not sure recommendations like this help much.\" One parent, Serian Walker, who is also a police officer, said in her profession she had dealt with suicides by children who could not cope with the pressure. Ms Walker, from Cardiff, said she struggled to get her 15-year-old daughter to take a break from revision. \"I know she isn't sleeping well and I know she's miserable. Of course I'd like her to excel, but not at the cost of her mental health,\" she said. But Clare Wagner, head teacher of the West London Free School, endorsed Mr Lenon's tips as \"excellent revision advice\".

I can't see how you can get top grades and study fewer hours,\" she said. \"It is not about finding a work-life balance, it is about making a sacrifice.\"  ] ",

The Scottish government is considering incorporating the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) into a new body with additional responsibilities. The independent GTCS itself has expressed fears this will be costly, legally complex and achieve little. The Scottish government said it will consider all responses on the issue. A consultation on legislation to reform school governance closed earlier this week.    Much of the debate has centred on plans to give more powers to head teachers and on what powers local authorities should retain. But ministers are also looking at creating a new body called the Educational Workforce Council for Scotland which would be responsible for the work currently carried out by the GTCS.  International reputation The EIS union opposes scrapping the council and fears its replacement may not be independent of government. It said: \"The EIS is firmly opposed to any dilution of the role and independence of the General Teaching Council for Scotland. \"We fail to understand why the Scottish government feels compelled, or even entitled, to interfere in the running of what is a legally constituted independent body. \"The EIS has noted the high regard the GTCS is held in internationally. \"We are baffled as to why the Scottish government wishes to do away with a Scottish success story such as the GTCS.\" A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Our education reforms are focussed on giving schools and head teachers more power and money to raise standards and close the attainment gap. \"Our reform proposals are based on international evidence of how high- performing education systems work - and will deliver extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils. \"We welcome feedback in response to our consultation on the Education (Scotland) Bill and will consider all the responses received.\" * * *  A model of self-regulation  **by Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Education Correspondent** The main aim of the government's school reform plans is to empower heads and parents. It wants as much power as possible at as local a level as possible. The argument is that allowing heads to do what they believe to be right for their schools and encouraging positive involvement from parents is more likely to raise attainment. A proposal to abolish the existing General Teaching Council for Scotland and incorporate its role into a new body may seem to be of little direct concern to parents and learners but for many in the profession it would be a significant development. The GTCS sees itself as a model of how self-regulation can work. Its name is recognised by professionals well beyond Scotland. The arguments being advanced against axing the GTCS and creating a new body are detailed and sometimes complex - questions over the cost and whether the change would achieve anything positive are to the fore. But lurking in the background some have another concern. The GTCS has been formally independent of government in recent years. This means ministers cannot simply decree, for instance, that there should be changes to teacher training. Some will want reassurances that the proposed new workforce council would enjoy similar autonomy. Recently the English charity Teach First, which places trainees in the classroom at a relatively early stage, looked at whether it should be involved in the bid for a new teacher training contract in Scotland. It had, legitimately, tried to win friends and supporters in high places. Those in the profession who were concerned knew that, given the scale of the opposition within the profession here, such a course was unlikely to win GTCS accreditation even if some in government circles may have been impressed by the charity's work elsewhere. If critics of the plans for the GTCS are to be appeased, the government will need to reassure them that the replacement body will truly belong to the profession itself. * * * In its response to the consultation, the council said: \"The proposed loss of GTCS as an independent body has the potential to do irreparable harm to the status and identity of teachers.\" All teachers working in Scotland have to be registered with the GTCS which is responsible for upholding professional standards. It can also \"strike off\" teachers who are guilty of misconduct or who fail to make the grade but also helps teachers in their professional development. The government said it intends the body should operate independently from Scottish ministers. But the GTCS council believes there is no case for it to include those who are only indirectly responsible for children's education, such as school librarians and home-school link workers The GTCS is one of many bodies to have made submissions to the consultation on the governance review which closed this week.  ] ",

      "article": "[ Since gaining independence in 1957, [Ghana](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ghana.html) has focused on improving access to education and achieving universal enrolment.  Primary education became free in 1961 and the 1980s saw major reforms swept through the education system, including restructuring primary and secondary education and introducing vocational classes.  In September 2017, the Ghanaian government made secondary education free, with\\xa0President\\xa0[Nana Akufo- Addo](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/talktojazeera/2017/11/akufo-addo- africa-march-democracy-hard-reverse-171124113644826.html)\\xa0reportedly saying: \"There will be no admission fees, no library fees, no science centre fees, no computer laboratory fees, no examination fees, no utility fees. There will be free textbooks, free boarding and free meals.\"  The benefits of the Ghanian government's focus on [education](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/education.html) are reflected in the country's rising literacy rate. According to UNESCO statistics from 2010, the literacy rate among 15-24-year-olds is 85.72 percent, compared with 34.89 percent in those aged 65 or older.   {articleGUID}   Despite these measures, many children, particularly those living in rural areas, struggle to stay in school.  Economic necessity forces children to drop out of school in search of work, and girls are often charged with looking after younger siblings and helping with domestic work.  NGOs are attempting to address these issues at the community level and ensure every child has access to education.  Johnson Ayonka is the director of the Grassroots Transparency Initiative at WillWay Africa, an NGO that supports low-income communities in health, education and economic empowerment.  Jo Hallett works with Ghana School Aid and Let's Read Ghana to provide grants to schools in rural communities and support the teaching of English in the far north of the country.  Al Jazeera spoke with Ayonka and Hallett about the realities of getting an education in Ghana today.   **Al Jazeera: What effect has the recent removal of secondary school fees had on both children and schools?**   **Johnson Ayonka:** It has had an impact, but because the national government is inefficient, the money from the central government doesn't always get to the communities. In the very poor communities, there is the wider problem of poverty that's forcing people to drop out, despite education being free and some schools are still charging fees because the money from the government didn't get to them.  Even though the intention behind the policy was good, the government was not well prepared to implement it to the fullest. They also tried to implement it from the centre, instead of from the local area and the money was not made available in advance. It was sort of \"putting the cart before the horse\", instead of the money being there before the policy, the policy comes and then the money.  The policy is OK, the students have enrolled because they know that they'll get free education, but after that, we find out that nothing effective takes place because what is needed is not there because of bureaucracy and inefficiency.   **Al Jazeera: What are the barriers still preventing access to education today?**   **Jo Hallett:** In the last few years, there has also been quite a push on more school buildings and a big push on enrolment and I think that [the Ghanaian government has] done very well on getting the vast majority of children into school, [but] there are huge barriers to accessing education. There's a serious lack of trained teachers. In many of the schools we go into, the majority of the staff are volunteers or student teachers.  There's a lack of finance for schools in general, so although the children are there, the buildings are not there, although overall they have improved, lots of schools have either very poor buildings or no buildings at all; they call it \"under the tree\" so classes are taught under a tree. There's a lack of equipment and a lack of books and resources, the training of teachers, finance of all sorts and that needs to be addressed.  Often the teachers don't get paid for several months because the District Education doesn't have the finance to pay them and, therefore, there's a lack of commitment on their part to some extent. Class sizes also vary enormously. A good teacher can manage quite a big class but sometimes it's overwhelming: you go into a classroom and there are 70 pupils in there and one teacher who may not be trained, who's trying to manage them and it's impossible really, it's really difficult.  > There's a lack of finance for schools in general, so although the children are there, the buildings are not there ... lots of schools have either very poor buildings or no buildings at all.\\r > > Jo Hallett, NGO worker > >   **  Al Jazeera: How are rural communities affected?**   **Hallett:** In many rural areas, the families are involved in subsistence farming or illegal mining and, with farming, the children get pulled out of school for harvest and sewing.  Another really significant thing that we see is the complete lack of spoken English in the rural areas. In school, after the first couple of years, the education is in English. There are 52 languages in Ghana, but the common language, and the language of government, [and] the language they're expected to learn in is English.  If you live in a town, the chances are that you will see English sometimes and hear it, but out in the rural areas where we go in the far north, they speak a language called Guruni, which is spoken in a very small area, and it's not written down at all so there aren't any signposts or posters so [children] don't have text in the environment, either in their own language or in English.   **Al Jazeera: Do girls face additional challenges to entering education?**   **Ayonka:** \\xa0At the primary level the gender gap is small, it's very, very small, and that indicates that a lot of progress has been made in the education of girls. But as girls mature into their teenage years, they face a lot of challenges because there's a lot of gender disparity in terms of who should do house chores, so girls suffer more.   {articleGUID}   When you get closer to higher levels of education, even though the gap has reduced over the years, it's still there because cultural factors come into play and there are issues of early marriage and families spending more on boys than on girls.  We need something to address that gap because it will relieve the economic aspects of education and leave the responsibility to the government so that families don't have to decide: \"Are we going to educate the boy and leave the girl out? Or are we going to educate both?\"   **Al Jazeera: What steps should the government take now?**   **Ayonka:** What we see recently from the government is that a lot of policies and actions are done in isolation. Let's say you see an area where there's a high instance of teenage pregnancy and you don't also make arrangements for the education authorities to work with the healthcare authorities and social workers; even though there's free education, you are still going to get low enrolment because there is no coordination.  Another problem is the issue of access to the education infrastructure, there's free education on paper but the schools are few, especially in the rural areas. You can say you want to give free education to people but if you don't give them physical access to the schools by building more schools, then you still don't have free education ... I think communities need to be empowered to build their own schools, to recruit their own teachers, monitor the teachers and make sure that the standard of education is high.  There's a big gap between what is happening at the government level and what is happening at the community level.   **Hallett:\\xa0** There needs to be a bigger commitment to funding and a raising of the status of teachers. [The government] has done some really good things, some of the curriculum books are excellent, but they also need to have a bit of money and resources to back up that commitment, but I do think Ghana is trying hard. ] ",

There was outrage in the Pacific nation this week after a girls' high school rugby team was withdrawn from a competition because of their gender. An official letter said that sports such as rugby and boxing went against Tongan women's dignity and culture. Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva responded by saying that the letter did not represent official government policy. He said that the government \"actively encourages the participation of every Tongan student in all sports without discrimination\".    \"It is, however, for the individual students and their parents to decide whether or not they should participate in a particular sport like rugby and boxing,\" the prime minister added.  * [Anger at Tonga women's rugby 'ban'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-43469604)  'Tongan cultural values' Earlier in the week, the Ministry of Education and Training said it had taken the decision in order to \"preserve the dignity of Tongan women and hold on to Tongan cultural values\".

(Susan Walsh/AP) This is the second of three pieces about school creform in Indiana, where Vice President Pence was governor from 2013 to 2017 and pushed policies to expand school choice. The choice program started in 2011, when Mitch Daniels was governor, and continued under Pence, who drove an effort to expand charter schools and loosen eligibility requirements to expand the voucher program 9s reach. [A Washington Post story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/how- indianas-school-voucher-program-soared-and-what-it-says-about-education-in- the-trump-era/2016/12/26/13d1d3ec-bc97-11e6-91ee- 1adddfe36cbe_story.html?utm_term=.3c8ee489335e) on Indiana 9s voucher program, published in December 2016, said in part: > Indiana lawmakers originally promoted the state 9s school voucher program as a way to make good on America 9s promise of equal opportunity, offering children from poor and lower-middle-class families an escape from public schools that failed to meet their needs. > > But five years after the program was established, more than half of the state 9s voucher recipients have never attended Indiana public schools, meaning that taxpayers are now covering private and religious school tuition for children whose parents had previously footed that bill. Many vouchers also are going to wealthier families, those earning up to $90,000 for a household of four. _[[ How Indiana 9s school voucher program soared, and what it says about education in the Trump era ](https://www.washingtonpolicy.org/publications/detail/indiana-helps-parents- decide-when-where-and-how-their-children-receive-the-best-possible- education)]_ The first post looked at the roots of the reform program in Indiana under then-Gov. Mitch Daniels, and this one discusses Pence 9s role in the expansion of vouchers, as well as the misuse of public tax dollars in Indiana 9s charter and voucher sector. Pence 9s support for vouchers and other school choice programs is shared by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. This post was written by Carol Burris, a former award-winning New York high school principal who is executive director of the [Network for Public Education](https://networkforpubliceducation.org/), a nonprofit advocacy group that supports public education. Burris was named the 2010 Educator of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State, and in 2013 the same organization named her the New York State High School Principal of the Year. Burris has been chronicling problems with modern school reform and school choice for years on this blog. She has previously written about problems with charter schools in California and several other states. _[[ A telling story of school 8reform 9 in Mike Pence 9s home state, Indiana ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/12/21/a-telling-story-of-school-reform-in-mike-pences-home- state-indiana/?utm_term=.5e2d617622b5)]_ _**By Carol Burris**_ [The Rev. Jake Runyon](http://www.stjudefw.org/church/staff/) of St. Jude Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,[ opened a meeting](https://vimeo.com/86925853) with his parishioners four years ago with a prayer. After ending with the sign of the cross, a Power Point presentation went up for his cParish Subsidy Reconfiguration Plan 2014-15, and he[ shared his plan](https://vimeo.com/86925853) on how to better fund the church by taking advantage of the state 9s taxpayer-funded school voucher program.  cThe Indiana school scholarship fund is a great benefit for parents, but not necessarily a great benefit for the parish because it 9s not extra money, he said. Nevertheless, he said he had a way to turn that around. By taking greater advantage of school vouchers, he would be able cto do some things on the church side of things like fix the steeple, paint the roof and maybe grow the ministries we can do, you know, on the church side of things. The priest then described the plan. The annual tuition of St. Jude parish school would rise from $3,000 a student to $4,300 a student because the voucher limit was much higher than the present tuition amount. He told the parents not to worry because they would not see a bigger bill. He would crestructure tuition. St. Jude Elementary School, like nearly all Catholic parish schools, is partially subsidized by charitable donations from donors, as well as the Sunday collection plate. The cost of education without the donation subsidy would now become the tuition. This would maximize the money the school could get from vouchers and reduce what the church kicks in. All of the charitable scholarship donations would then become subsidies for the wealthier families not eligible for the voucher program. He told the parish, with a chuckle, that the state could not tell them where to set subsidy limits so he had a plan that would subsidize nearly every parent. Full financial assistance would go to families making up to $180,000 a year. Fifty percent would go to the few families who made up to $270,000. Families who made more, he joked, should cgo to the chapel and ask Jesus what to do about that. He then made it clear that even those families were also free to ask for assistance if they needed it, and he did not care what assets families had. St. Jude is one of many religious schools throughout Indiana that is receiving dramatically increased revenue from the state. Last year, the taxpayers of Indiana [paid out $146.1 million to voucher schools](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2017/03/19/whats- school-voucher-heres-primer/98688344/), with most of it going to families who would have sent their children to private school anyway. **Indiana 9s voucher program and its radical roots** Indiana 9s 2011 voucher program [began literally with a kiss](https://www.washingtonpolicy.org/publications/detail/indiana-helps- parents-decide-when-where-and-how-their-children-receive-the-best-possible- education) when then Gov. Mitch Daniels picked up the bill and brought it to his lips. Daniels and his allies did more than just begin the nation 9s largest voucher program. As the bill made its way through the statehouse, a [$1,000 tax deduction for homeschoolers and private school families was also added](http://dailysignal.com/2011/04/22/indiana-one-step-closer-to-the-most- expansive-school-choice-to-date/). This allowed private school parents and homeschoolers to deduct costs above tuition, such as school supplies. Daniels also expanded the already existing Scholarship Tax Credit Program that gives tax credits to companies and individuals who make donations to cscholarship organizations that, in turn, provide vouchers. Those taking the credit get 50 percent of what they donate back. The passage of the voucher bills and tax write-offs were [hailed then by\\xa0 Betsy DeVos, then a school choice advocate and now U.S. education secretary,](https://www.federationforchildren.org/indiana-senate-passes- expansive-school-voucher-program-school-choice-sweeps-nation/) who said, cWe thank Governor Daniels and the Indiana Legislature for working so hard to make widespread school choice a reality across the state. Since 2011, [the political action committees (PACs) of the American Federation for Children, which she co- founded,](http://campaignfinance.in.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/ContributionSearch.aspx?results=true&LastName=American%20Federation%20for%20Children&LastNameSearchType=1&Address=&City=&State=&Zip=&FinanceCategoryID=-32768&ContributionCodeID=-32768&Contributi) have contributed $1,040,540 to Republican pro-voucher Hoosiers and PACs. DeVos family members, including Betsy and her husband Dick, have personally contributed $1,525,000 to Indiana candidates or PACs since the voucher law was put in place. Their prior contributions (1998 to 2010) in that state totaled only $62,000. The passage of the voucher bill was also praised by Robert Enlow, president and chief executive officer of the Milton and Rose Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, which changed its name in 2016 to EdChoice. The chairman of the EdChoice board is the CEO of Overstock.com., Patrick M. Byrne. A Utah resident, Byrne contributed $465,000 to Indiana candidates and PACs beginning with Mitch Daniels 9s campaign. He and his family financed [over $4 million of the $5 million](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/695242259 /Spending-on-voucher-battle-cost-84-million.html) raised by Families for Choice, a PAC formed to support vouchers in a 2007 Utah referendum. Upon realizing that vouchers were rejected by 62 percent of voters, Byrne [referred to the referendum](http://origin.sltrib.com/portlet/article/html/fragments/print_article.jsp?articleId=7392263&siteId=297) as a cstatewide IQ test that Utah voters failed.\\xa0 c Located in Indianapolis, EdChoice has a strong influence on the policies and politics of the state. For that reason, it is worth understanding the foundation 9s roots. The founder, libertarian economist Milton Friedman, had proposed the idea of school vouchers in 1955. Although some of Friedman 9s policy ideas have been adopted, many are well outside of the mainstream. For example, Friedman believed that\\xa0[Social Security should be shut down](http://blog.independent.org/2015/10/20/milton-friedmans-solution-for- social-security-would-work-for-government-pensions- too/?link_id=1&can_id=481aa792da2a79ba2a38c6faa410b9f1&source=email-we-need- your-help-to-tell-the-truth-about-school-choice- action-1-3&email_referrer=&email_subject=we-need-your-help-to-tell-the-truth- about-school-choice-action-1)\\xa0because it created welfare dependency, that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be abolished, and [that the licensing of doctors](https://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/09/milton-friedman- argues-for-no- licensure.html?link_id=0&can_id=481aa792da2a79ba2a38c6faa410b9f1&source=email- we-need-your-help-to-tell-the-truth-about-school-choice- action-1-3&email_referrer=&email_subject=we-ne) should be eliminated because the American Medical Association was ca monopoly. [In this video](https://www.google.com/search?q=Milton+Friedman+and+the+enemies+of+school+choice+and+Harlem+video&ei=_-JbWpnCI4Spggez4YXABA&start=10&sa=N&biw=1039&bih=779) entitled cThe Enemies of School Choice, Friedman begins by boldly claiming that vouchers cwould solve all of the critical problems faced by schools. According to Friedman, school vouchers would eliminate discipline problems, reduce segregation and solve the problem of school busing. He presents no evidence, just claims based on his disdain for government regulation. **Privatization and Mike Pence** When the end of Mitch Daniels 9 last term as governor was nearing, the money to sustain and expand school privatization in Indiana moved to gubernatorial candidate Mike Pence. The DeVos family contributed directly and indirectly through contributions to their AFC PACs, which in turn contributed to Hoosiers for a Quality Education, a pro-voucher PAC that was started by Fred Klipsch. Klipsch, an EdChoice board member [who bragged to the Catholic Business Exchange](http://catholicbusinessexchange.org/2013/fred-klipsch/) that his PAC had created a Republican super-majority in the state which supports school choice, was the treasurer of the Mike Pence for Indiana Political Action Committee. Pence, as governor,\\xa0 did everything he could to expand school choice. He [grew the number of charter schools](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown- center-chalkboard/2016/10/03/kaine-pence-and-k-12-education/) by creating a $50 million, low-interest loan program for technology and transportation as well as a $500 per student charter increase, which the legislature had scaled back from his original $1,500 ask. The greatest growth, however, was in the state 9s voucher program. Pence, who describes his religious beliefs as evangelical, removed the cap on the number of students who could qualify for a voucher to a private school, increased the limits on qualifying family income, and removed Daniel 9s stipulation that the student had to try the public school first. No longer was money being saved as a small number of students transferred from public to private schools. Now middle-income families already using private schools were having their tuition paid for, at least partially, by the state. **Discrimination and disturbing curriculum** Nearly all of the 300-plus Indiana private schools that receive vouchers are religious schools. Although they may not discriminate in admissions based race, color, national origin or disability, they can require attendance in a designated church, mosque or synagogue and they may select students based on other factors such as test scores, discipline records and the lifestyle of their parents. The Lighthouse Christian Academy in Bloomington received national attention during the January 2017 confirmation hearings of Betsy DeVos when it was revealed that the [admission 9s brochure](https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/news/local/lighthouse-christian- academy-responds-to-concerns-over-its-admissions-policy/article_92d88110-415b- 11e7-bfc0-87e27ca51d68.html) for the school said that the school can refuse to admit or expel students living in a home that includes chomosexual or bisexual activity or cpracticing alternate gender identity. The Lighthouse Christian Academy received over $665,000 in state funds to enroll 152 students, which represent more than half of its total enrollment. Concerns regarding fundamentalist Christian voucher schools go beyond their exclusionary practices. Religious ideology often supplants facts in many of the history and science texts that are used by these schools. A 2017 analysis of the texts used by Indiana private schools that receive vouchers by [the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school- voucher-evangelical-education-betsy-devos_us_5a021962e4b04e96f0c6093c) found that many of the Christian fundamentalist schools receiving vouchers used texts from either [A Beka Books](https://www.amazon.com/Books-Beka- Book/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AA%20Beka%20Book), which is associated with the ultra-conservative Pensacola Christian College, or Bob Jones University Press. [The Huffington Post said](http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/20171001 /far-right-faith-based-views-rule-in-textbooks) the [A Beka Books 9s](https://www.amazon.com/Books-Beka- Book/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AA%20Beka%20Book) middle-school history text blames Satan for both the theory of evolution and modern psychology. It uncovered a history text that claimed that God used the Trail of Tears to bring Native Americans to Christ. The texts from [Bob Jones University Press](http://www.bjupress.com/page/Home) are equally questionable. They instruct that most slaveholders were good to their slaves, the Klu Klux Klan used the burning cross to fight moral depravity, and that cdinosaurs and humans were definitely on the earth at the same time and may have even lived side by side within the past few thousand years. **Accountability** Even if we were to put concerns about discrimination and biased curricula aside, questions regarding how tax dollars are used (and misused) remain. Voucher advocates say that Indiana has the strongest charter and voucher accountability laws in the nation. While on the books that may be true, reality tells a different story. Voucher schools with grades of 8D 9 or 8F 9 for two years in a row are prohibited from taking on new voucher students until they raise performance. This law cost private schools with poor test scores considerable funding. To keep the voucher money flowing, last summer the legislature passed a new law that allows voucher schools to appeal to the State Board of Education, whose members are appointed by the governor. As soon as the law was passed, [four religious schools applied for a waiver](https://inschoolmatters.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/private-schools-that- got-voucher-waivers-were-losing-state-funding/) and all four were approved to take on new voucher students despite their failing grades. The Indiana voucher program has also been an escape hatch for failing charter schools. The Padua Academy, a charter school in Indianapolis, had two years of consecutive failing ratings. Instead of shutting down, Padua [became St. Anthony 9s Catholic School.](http://www.archindy.org/criterion/local/2015/09-04/anthony.html) \\xa0The same principal who led the failing charter stayed on as the leader of the replacement voucher school, which received $1.2 million in tax dollars. Failing charters flipping to voucher schools is not limited to Padua. Imagine Schools is the largest charter management corporation in the United States. Imagine was founded and operated by Dennis Bakke, the former CEO of an energy company, AES, which merged with the Indianapolis Power and Light Company (IPALCO) in 2001. That merger would quickly become a [disaster](http://prospect.org/article/mitch-daniels-due-diligence) for IPALCO stockholders and workers. Stock price plummeted and many lost their jobs and their retirement savings. When Bakke [was ousted from AES](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2003/03/when_bad_things_happen_to_good_companies.html) in 2002 after its stock crashed, he moved into the charter\\xa0 management business. Imagine quickly expanded and became notorious for the real estate deals of its subsidiary company, SchoolHouse Finance. SchoolHouse Finance buys properties, often selling them for twice or three times the purchase to a buyer, and then leases them back from the buyer in order to then lease them to Imagine charter schools at exorbitant rates. Investigations of Imagine Charters in [Ohio](http://www.dispatch.com/article/20141012/NEWS/310129826) and [Florida](http://www.tampabay.com/news/imagine-charter-schools-expensive- leases-draw-scrutiny/1215822) found charters paying leases that amounted, in some cases, to half of the schools 9 revenue from tax dollars. Imagine was fined $1 million [by Missouri](https://www.educationdive.com/news/imagine- schools-ordered-to-pay-1m-in-self-dealing-scheme/355282/) for self-dealing. Ball State University, the authorizer of two of Indiana 9s Imagine charters, refused, based on poor performance, to continue to sponsor the schools when they came up for renewal. Those two schools, Imagine MASTer Academy and Imagine Schools on Broadway, responded by merging and transforming into the Horizon Christian Academy.

(Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images) Just 10 days after President Trump took office last year, an Interior Department official suggested a swift change to its website in preparation for Trump 9s choice to lead the department, Ryan Zinke. While Zinke wouldn 9t be sworn in for weeks, Office of Policy Analysis senior adviser Indur Goklany\\xa0emailed Doug Domenech\\xa0 4 a Trump appointee who would become the Interior Department 9s assistant secretary of insular areas 4\\xa0telling him\\xa0they would cbe doing the new Secretary a favor if \\u2026 the current 8Our Priorities 9 page visible on the DOI home page were removed before he is confirmed. Unlike Domenech and some of the other Interior officials who were taking a fresh look at the department 9s policies and messaging, Goklany wasn 9t a new arrival. He had been working at the Interior Department since Ronald Reagan was president and had spent years questioning whether climate change would damage the planet as much as some of his colleagues predicted. Goklany, who often goes by the nickname cGoks, has written papers for several conservative think tanks as well as participated in their events and films\\xa0while working at the Office of Policy Analysis\\xa0for more than 30 years. Weeks after Trump 9s inauguration, he found himself within the inner circle of the Interior Department 9s leadership. He weighed in on climate change discussions, attended meetings with some of Zinke 9s senior aides and began working in the office of the deputy secretary. Goklany 9s transition from an Interior backbencher to someone with access to key decision-makers highlights a regular bureaucratic ritual\\xa0that has attracted little notice under\\xa0this\\xa0administration: When a new president comes to power, civil servants aligned with the administration can suddenly gain prominence. Plenty of federal employees might be seething since Trump 9s arrival, but others have welcomed it and are thriving. A batch of emails newly released under the Freedom of Information Act, coupled with interviews with current and former federal officials and academics, chart the ascent of a longtime Interior analyst who had established his conservative bona fides outside the department as he feuded with some of his colleagues within. As\\xa0Goklany began\\xa0suggesting an overhaul of the Interior Department 9s website, he explained to Domenech in [a Jan. 27 email](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/emails-from-indur- goklany-on-scrubbing-interiors-online-references-to-climate-change/2811/) that he was making crevisions that would be technically and scientifically more accurate than what 9s currently on it, and also provide context, which the current one doesn 9t. Three days later, he proposed wiping out the\\xa0page in question altogether.  cI actually think removing the Priorities page is better and more efficient than just modifying certain pages because climate change is not the only questionable priority on the current Priorities page, Goklany wrote. Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said Friday that she had been informed by the department 9s human resources office that she could not comment on Goklany 9s role. Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute who headed Trump 9s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency and has worked with Goklany for years in what Ebell described as his cmoonlighting job as a one-man think tank, said his longtime ally has been empowered in a way he hasn 9t been since the Reagan administration.  cObviously they kept him in a box during the Obama administration, and now they 9ve let him loose, said Ebell, who lobbied the president to withdraw the\\xa0United States from the Paris climate agreement. cHe 9s a national treasure, in my view. He 9s a very meticulous analyst of policies, and he knows how to get behind the claims and look at the data. Others with knowledge of the agency 4 including Joel Clement, who [headed the Office of Policy Analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy- environment/wp/2017/10/04/whistleblower-resigns-keeping-my-voice-more- important-than-keeping-my-job/?utm_term=.080641a197d5) from January 2011 until July 2017 4 said in an email that he fails to understand why the new leadership at\\xa0the Interior Department would rely on someone with a background in electrical engineering to help guide climate policy.  cA climate change denier is someone who rejects the multiple lines of corroborating scientific evidence that show that rapid change is real, it 9s caused by human activities, and it 9s extremely dangerous, Clement said. cFor an electrical engineer to suggest that climate change is good for society and is just dandy, there are lots of nonexperts with opinions; the bizarre thing is that sitting political appointees in the Department of the Interior would seek out his advice. Throughout his career at the\\xa0department 4 Goklany joined the Office of Policy Analysis in 1986 4 he has questioned the severity of climate change 9s effects, the extent to which humans have contributed to it and the predictions of its future course. Under both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, Goklany weighed in on international climate reports in his personal and professional capacity. Michael MacCracken, who took a leave from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to work as senior global change scientist at the interagency Office of the U.S. Global Change Research Program from 1993 to 2002, recalled in an interview Thursday that Goklany frequently submitted comments on behalf of the Interior Department that suggested the United States could adapt to climate- change\\xa0effects more easily than many scientists projected. As officials worked on the official Climate Action Report that the Bush administration released in 2002, Goklany wrote a Nov. 13, 2001, memo in which he\\xa0said that the federal government should jettison phrases the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used to describe possible climate impacts 4 clikely and cvery likely, which have a numerical probability attached to them 4 in favor of cmight, cmay or ccould.  cWe are skeptical of the methodology used to grade different levels of possibilities, Goklany wrote. In the end, Harlan Watson, the State Department 9s special envoy to the\\xa0U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, who had co-authored a paper with Goklany, overruled him and said the administration should preserve words such as clikely and cvery likely.  cHe was very persistent, said MacCracken, chief scientist for climate change programs with the D.C.-based\\xa0Climate Institute, adding that he and others outlined in writing their reasons for rejecting aspects of Goklany 9s critiques. cI was lucky being relatively senior and a scientist in the process, so could go back at him. Goklany also regularly worked with conservative think tanks skeptical of climate change, publishing two books with the Cato Institute and speaking on panels held by the Heartland Institute. In 2012, Rep. Ra\\xfal M. Grijalva (Ariz.), now ranking Democrat of the House Natural Resources Committee, called for a probe into whether Goklany improperly received a $1,000-per-month payment from the Heartland Institute for writing a chapter in a book on climate science. Goklany asked to stop working on climate change at the Interior Department after Barack Obama took office. Clement, who supervised him, said he filed the FOIA request that produced the raft of emails related to Goklany 9s activities cbecause he refused to discuss these activities with his supervisors while I was there at DOI, and his work products, a mystery to all of us in the career ranks, were likely to represent threats to scientific integrity. The documents chronicle how Goklany reached out to new appointees in key positions and shared work he had done that meshed with Trump and Zinke 9s push for expanded fossil fuel production.  cIt was a pleasure to meet you last evening, Goklany [wrote](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/email-from-indur- goklany-to-downey-magallanes/2812/) Downey Magallanes, Zinke 9s deputy chief of staff, in a March 10, 2017, email, attaching two papers he had written cas an Independent Scientist on the benefits of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide, respectively. cI hope to run into you from time to time. Goklany asked for permission in March 2017 from\\xa0Interior 9s Ethics Office to speak at the Heartland Institute 9s International Conference on Climate Change. Goklany told a lawyer there that\\xa0he wanted to speak only in a cpersonal capacity, noting that he cworked on climate change matters for over 20 years until about 2009. At the conference, Heartland introduced Goklany as an cindependent scientist, without\\xa0referring to his Interior Department post. He posited correlations between rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and indicators of well-being, such as life expectancy and the per capita gross domestic product.  cInstead of living in the worst of times, we 9re actually living in the best of times, Goklany said, cand carbon dioxide and fossils fuels are a good part of that. Top officials at the Interior Department welcomed Goklany 9s input. While Clement had been exploring whether to move Goklany to the department 9s ethics office, the analyst sought instead to work directly with\\xa0Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason on policy matters. The job discussions came as Zinke 9s aides were orchestrating a [department-wide reassignment of Senior Executive Service](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy- environment/wp/2017/09/27/zinke-says-his-workers-are-disloyal-they-say-his- personnel-moves-break-the-law/?utm_term=.ea41f39a8812) employees, such as Goklany, Clement and others from around the country. In June, they reassigned 33 of those staffers. While the vast majority received their new postings without providing input, an email exchange in April shows that Zinke 9s aides solicited Goklany 9s views on where he should work. Goklany informed Domenech that Clement was seeking to detail him to an ethics assignment, noting: cThe theory is an SES-er can do anything. But I 9d rather not! Domenech consulted with\\xa0the department 9s principal deputy solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, and then informed Goklany that he had told a colleague cto slow-walk action moving you to Ethics. Instead, Cason in May approved Goklany 9s transfer to work in the office of the deputy secretary, though Clement said Interior officials\\xa0refused to sign the paperwork making the detail official. According to copies of Cason 9s schedule obtained by the advocacy group Friends of the Earth under FOIA, Goklany attended 19 meetings with Cason between April 5, 2017, and Jan. 16, 2018. Only eight of the sessions list topics, and two of them are focused on climate change. Even before moving under Cason,\\xa0in April Goklany procured the Obama administration 9s fiscal year 2013 climate budget for Cason and Domenech as the Trump team was preparing to roll out its first congressional budget request, which consolidated climate activities within the Interior Department. Later that month,\\xa0Domenech sent Goklany an Obama-era National Park Service brochure on the effects of global warming throughout the parks. Goklany marked up the document with this thoughts, describing a page titled cResponding to Climate Change as cpropaganda for a favored option. Goklany also interpreted media coverage of climate for high-level Interior officials. He described a [Los Angeles Times article](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-california-fire-seasons/) about California 9s brutal wildfire season as cbetter than most while deriding a [New York Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/world/asia/guam-north-korea-climate- change.html) about the impact of sea-level rise and other climate effects on Guam by arguing that ctide gauge data, however, doesn 9t show any acceleration in sea level rise due to man-made global warming or whatever. By May, Goklany was\\xa0reviewing a draft of at least one U.S. Geological Survey paper on climate change and preparing ca\\xa0summary overview of climate change activities gleaned from examining web presence, remarking on the volume of climate communication done by Obama 9s Interior Department.  cI estimate that there are over 100,000 pages on the web on DOI servers (including bureaus) that refer to climate change! he [wrote](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/indur-goklanys- may-19-emails-to-senior-doi-official-james-cason/2813/) to Cason. Late last year, Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt signed a secretarial order\\xa0[wiping out four directives and policy manuals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/05 /interior-rescinds-climate-conservation-policies-because-theyre-inconsistent- with-trumps-energy-goals/?utm_term=.0542ae1cabc5)\\xa0instructing Interior employees on how to address climate and other environmental impacts on public lands, including at least one Goklany singled out to Cason in May.

      "article": "[ I think the lesson of the snack shop is that the same equation holds true when it comes to educating our nation's future citizens. And not just in the dining halls, but in the entire way America's four-year colleges and universities deliver the undergraduate experience. Put the right ingredients together, give them ample time and space to mingle, and great things can happen. Call it slow college. Like slow cooking, it's not new. It's long been practiced by venerable institutions in the United States and Europe. And our current American moment, defined by a breakneck digital pace and public discourse that often begins at belligerent and degenerates from there, is exactly the right time to reinvest in this approach. Acceleration, or decreasing the amount of time it takes to get an undergraduate degree, is a trend in higher education nationwide. Some universities [are compressing bachelor's degrees](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/nyregion/nyu-accelerated- graduation.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=C9994933CF3FB1676854490CCDE8A7AE&gwt=pay) to three years or less. The assumption seems to be that what matters is the amount of content delivered, not the quantity of time invested. I challenge that thinking. [![College credit?

Kill that ](/2015/03/30/opinions/laitinen-credit- hour/index.html) Our job as educators is not to merely disgorge information and dispense degrees. We should also help shape young people as the citizens, leaders, parents and neighbors they are going to become. Intellectual development and skills training are part of that. But so are emotional and spiritual development. Ethical development. And civic development. All of which take time. None of this is easy, but it's all within our reach. For starters, we can do more to help everyone afford a four-year college experience. One argument for fast education is that it's cheaper. No doubt, an immersive, residential education requires substantial investment. But rather than excluding students who can't make that investment, universities should pour whatever resources are available into financial aid. Not every university can eliminate loans, as some have, but all universities can work harder to eliminate cost as a barrier to a complete college education. Once students are admitted, universities can provide time and space for learning and growth beyond the classroom. On many campuses, a typical full- time student takes 15 credit hours, which translates to spending about 15 hours a week in class. If education ends when students leave the classroom, we're missing a huge opportunity. We should capture as many waking hours as we can by creating 24/7 prospects for social and academic development.

Start by reforming the accreditation system](/2017/12/27/opinions/student-debt-reform-accreditation-system- sheffield-opinion/index.html) One way we're doing this at Vanderbilt is by replacing traditional housing with residential colleges: communities where students, faculty \"heads of house\" and visiting scholars live, dine and learn together. Comprehensive four-year residential colleges have existed for centuries, most notably at Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, and at Yale, Harvard and Rice here in the United States (though if your first association was Hogwarts, you're not far off). Adopting this old-world model today might seem counterintuitive. It would certainly be easier and less expensive to house students in conventional dorms. But rather than make college a \"grab and go\" experience, let's give students the ingredients and time to allow new ideas and perspectives to simmer, blend and marinate. We need to nurture intentional learning communities. Our country will be better for it. Socially, residential colleges combine people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives. In a nation where universities and Southwest Airlines flights may be the last places where we intentionally mix people from starkly different backgrounds, we owe students the time to explore those differences. We owe students the opportunity and the prompting to work, play, debate, and problem-solve together before we launch them into workplaces that are increasingly heterogeneous, or ask them to wade into national conversations about tough issues like racial and gender equality or social justice.

On our campus, a number of interdisciplinary majors and an intentional increase in shared teaching, research and other collaboration among different departments and colleges have led to future teachers collaborating with future policymakers, English majors learning alongside engineers, and musicians studying molecular biology. While many may think this type of engagement is a given of college life, it's not, and it only happens through deliberate and intentional planning. As a result, graduates leave more well-rounded, with a diverse set of technical and people skills. My job, of course, is to consider how we can best educate students at a four- year, residential university. But slow college need not only be practiced at schools like mine. Re-evaluating how we think of higher education generally, and putting greater stock in measures that build community and create opportunities for students to learn across disciplines and from one another, is something any post-secondary institution can do. This approach and philosophy will better equip our young people for life after college and help safeguard our democracy. Champions of the slow food movement say that eating well makes us healthier as a nation. So, I'd argue, does learning well. By giving students time to engage in a more measured, reflective way with what they learn, we produce better- educated citizens: thoughtful people with broader vision, driven by curiosity and unafraid to tackle the complex problems we so urgently face. And by letting students steep in the company of those unlike them, we produce citizens capable of reasoned, civil discourse and cooperation. All of this is essential for maintaining e pluribus unum and trying to fulfill the hopes of the great American project of pluralism.

      "article": "[ The Senate 9s top education leaders will consider reinstating Pell grants for incarcerated students, a move that would restore a federal lifeline to the nation 9s cash-strapped prison education system. , Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the committee would consider reinstating the federal financial aid grants in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act currently underway. , The move would reverse a decades-old decision to strike the benefit from the higher education law and signal a shift toward recognizing education as a centerpiece in efforts to overhaul criminal justice law. The federal student aid could be used to cover the cost of college courses taught in prisons, online or both. , Mr. Alexander said that he was open to re-examining Pell grants for prisoners, which were banned in the 1994 crime bill passed under President Bill Clinton. In 2015, President Barack Obama 9s Education Department piloted an experimental program that allowed 12,000 incarcerated students to be eligible for the financial aid. If reinstated, millions of dollars would be made available to eligible students in the United States 9 [prison population of 1.5 million.](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p16_sum.pdf) ,  cMost prisoners, sooner or later, are released from prison, and no one is helped when they do not have the skills to find a job, Mr. Alexander said in a statement. cMaking Pell grants available to them in the right circumstances is a good idea. , Mr. Alexander will find an ally in his committee 9s ranking Democrat, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, with whom he has partnered to broker deals, including reauthorizing the country 9s elementary and secondary education law and preserving insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. , Ms. Murray introduced Pell grant legislation last year that would expand the financial aid 4 which [currently supplies](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pellhow- much-money) about eight million low-income students with up to $5,920 yearly 4 to include inmates, undocumented immigrants and students with drug offenses. She also supported the Obama-era pilot program. ,  cI 9ve long believed education can open doors otherwise closed, and that is absolutely also the case for incarcerated individuals, Ms. Murray said in a statement on Wednesday night. cRepealing the ban on Pell grants for prisoners will give those who have paid their debts to society a meaningful second chance, and the ability to get their lives back on track and support themselves and their families once released. , Key conservative leaders who see rehabilitating prisoners as good social and economic policy are also likely to back it. , Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, who visited a prison education program in the months after she took office, called reinstating Pell grants for inmates ca very good and interesting possibility. , In his State of the Union address, President Trump cited overhauling the United States 9 prisons to chelp former inmates who have served their time get a second chance. , Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activist brothers, have poured millions of dollars into a new partnership with the Texas Public Policy Foundation to start the [Safe Streets and Second Chances](https://safestreetsandsecondchances.com/about/) program, which aims to rehabilitate the nearly 700,000 prisoners estimated to be released this year. , The political convergence is a significant shift away from the punitive response to soaring crime rates that led a Democratic Congress to strip the benefit when it passed the [Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr3355enr/pdf/BILLS- 103hr3355enr.pdf). , There is ca good-faith interest in this kind of work, said Max Kenner, the executive director of Bard Prison Initiative, which was started in 1999 by Bard College, a 150-year-old liberal arts institution. ,  cThere 9s no more effective thing, no more symbolic thing that can be done than the reinstatement of college in America 9s prisons, Mr. Kenner said. , The initiative is in six prisons in New York State, educating about 300 full- time students. The program has awarded 500 degrees since its founding. Its formerly incarcerated students have gone on to obtain graduate degrees from universities like Yale and Columbia. The program has a 2 percent recidivism rate. , Gerard Robinson, the executive director of the Center for Advancing Opportunity, said the face of the United States 9 prison population has changed since the 1990s. Most notably, in 2016, there were twice as many white females as black females in the sentenced prison population. , When African-Americans were caught in the crack epidemic, Congress sent them to prison and ended their educational opportunities, said Mr. Robinson, a Republican who served on the Trump transition team. Now that white people are being swept up in the system, especially with opioids, cthe response is mental health care and social support. , Lawmakers from both major parties supported revoking Pell grants. They argued that convicts should not take the financial aid resources from cash-strapped college students. , The 300 or so prison-education programs that had sprouted in the two decades after the Higher Education Act was enacted in 1965 collapsed to a handful that managed to get private funding after 1994. ,  cI still remember when the hammer fell, and colleges literally came in the next day and started packing up their boxes, all the books, said Sean Pica, who was serving time for manslaughter when Pell grants were revoked. ,  cWe couldn 9t believe it, he said. cFor most of us, it was the only thing that represented a second chance. , Mr. Pica entered the prison system at 16, with a ninth-grade education. After traveling to nine institutions, he had accumulated 119 college credits in prison-education programs, but was left with no path to a degree. , At his last institution, Sing Sing Correctional Facility in New York, an organization called Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison had come in to revive the program. , After serving 16 years of a 24-year sentence, Mr. Pica was released from prison in 2002 with three college degrees, including a master 9s. Now, he is the executive director of the nonprofit organization that helped him complete his college education. , A [RAND Corporation study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR266.html), commissioned by the Department of Justice, found that incarcerated students who had access to education were 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years than those who did not. The study also found that for every dollar invested in prison-education programs, at least $4 is saved on incarceration costs. The amount of Pell money going to prisons was less than 1 percent of all of the program 9s funding. , The pilot program started in the Obama era continues to operate. ,  cWe called it Second-Chance Pell, but for these folks who are incarcerated, they never had a first chance, said John B. King Jr., an education secretary in the Obama administration. cThey went to under- resourced schools that were struggling in a variety of ways, and didn 9t have access to opportunities. ] ",

Out of the top 10 states for new and used hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all- electric cars, only two -- Arizona and Utah -- voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, according to an [analysis of 2017 auto sales from from research site iSeeCars.com](https://www.iseecars.com/green-car-adoption- study). The share of green vehicle sales was highest in California, claiming 7.5 percent of all 2017 sales, or almost three times the national average of 2.6 percent. Washington and Oregon, both blue states with Democratic legislatures, were in second and third place with shares of 6.1 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. And Hawaii, which offers inducements such as free parking for electric cars and plug-in hybrids, was fourth with a 4.2 percent share. Consumers in blue states are partly responding to state incentives, while a determination to be environmentally friendly also plays a part in demand, iSeeCars.com said.  **State Incentives.** \\xa0The desire to cut emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases in Democratic states has led to the creation of strong incentives for the purchase of electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Some red states such as Oklahoma have also rolled out inducements.\\xa0 In some states, incentives include rebates, such as a $2,500 rebate in California. Massachusetts offers rebates to buyers, and also provides grants to businesses that install charging stations.\\xa0 Some states allow green cars to travel in high-occupancy lanes with only the driver on board, which is a major advantage to commuters. Several states, including Colorado, offer income tax credits for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. A list of state incentives [can be found at PlugIn America](https://pluginamerica.org/why-go-plug-in/state-federal- incentives/).\\xa0  **Federal tax credit:** \\xa0The federal tax credit of up to $7,500 has convinced many consumers to consider buying a green car. But in the case of plug-in hybrids, that credit can be as low as $4,000 because the benefit is based on battery size. Plug-ins rely on a smaller battery because they run on a gasoline engine part of the time. This federal subsidy will not last forever. It expires when a manufacturer has sold 200,000 total electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, a threshold that both Tesla and General Motors may hit later this year. A list of individual vehicles and their tax credits [can be found at Edmunds](https://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/the-ins-and-outs-of-electric- vehicle-tax-credits.html).\\xa0  **Lower fuel costs**. Even with gasoline prices remaining relatively low, electric cars can still provide a hefty savings. The EPA rates the all- electric Chevrolet Bolt at 119 MPGe, or miles per gallon electric equivalent. By comparison, the gasoline-powered Chevrolet Cruze has a combined city- highway rating of 37 MPG.\\xa0 From 2014 to 2017, Alaska had the greatest increase in green car adoption. That may well be because Alaska has some of the highest gas prices in the country, notes Julie Blackley, iSeeCars.com communications director. Auto companies, under pressure for higher average MPG, are proceeding as if electrics are the vehicles of the future. Honda just introduced a stylish new all-electric Insight (pictured above). And at the Geneva Motor Show this week, Volkswagen is showing the I.D. Vizzion 4which it says will be part of a new all-electric VW line on sale by 2020.   ] ",

      "article": "[ Betsy DeVos was picked to run the Education Department largely to continue the work she had embraced through her philanthropic work: advocating an expansion of charter schools. Hers was the most controversial Cabinet nomination by President Trump, requiring Vice President Pence to cast [a tie-breaking vote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/senate-to-vote-today-on- confirmation-of-betsy-devos/2017/02/06/fd4b7e9c- ec85-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html) confirming her for the position. That controversy had many causes, but a significant one was that many in the education community were concerned about turning over the department to someone who advocated transferring scarce public funding to what amounted to educational experiments. Which is to say that DeVos should, by now, be very aware that her advocacy of charter schools is contentious, to understate it a bit. Meaning, by extension, that when being interviewed by one of the most established television news programs in the country, she should be able to defend her position. Yet when interviewed by c60 Minutes for a program that aired on Sunday 4 she wasn 9t. > Betsy DeVos struggles to provide answers to '60 Minutes' when asked for evidence to support school choice policies. <https://t.co/yG3POYJre6> [pic.twitter.com/la8rsxqKYW](https://t.co/la8rsxqKYW) > > 4 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) [March 12, 2018](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/973008367215104000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  cIn places where there is a lot of choice that 9s been introduced, DeVos told CBS 9s Lesley Stahl, cFlorida, for example, studies show that when there 9s a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually, the results get better as well. This is DeVos 9s core case. Introducing charter schools forces public schools into the sort of competition you see in the free market, forcing the public institutions to improve. It 9s a market-based proposal for solving the endemic problem of low-performing schools. Florida, DeVos argues, is an example of where it works. But Stahl was prepared for this.  cHave the public schools in Michigan gotten better? Stahl asked. Michigan is a key litmus test because it 9s the place where DeVos 9s pre-government advocacy was centered. DeVos stumbled over a response.  cYour argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, Stahl said. cWhere you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. She later added, cThe public schools here are doing _worse_ than they did. DeVos didn 9t have much of a response except to point to cpockets where schools had improved (without identifying any). There are only two reasons that DeVos might not have been able to defend her position when confronted with the example of her home state. One is that she was simply unprepared for the interview and didn 9t have a team in place that could have ensured she was ready for an inevitable line of inquisition from Stahl. The other is that DeVos 9s case isn 9t as clear-cut as she presented it. A 2009 study from the [Rand Corp.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9428/index1.html)\\xa0found clittle evidence that the presence of charter schools affects the achievement scores of students in nearby traditional public schools either positively or negatively. A number of studies since have found [similarly murky](http://educationnext.org/the-effect-of-charter-schools-on- students-in-traditional-public-schools-a-review-of-the-evidence/) results. We can look at this another way. Using data from the [Education Department](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_203.20.asp), the [National Alliance for Public Charter Schools](http://www.publiccharters.org/) and the [National Assessment of Educational Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/), we looked at charter school enrollment and educational achievement in nearly 30 states between 2005 and 2015. The educational achievement data indicated the percentage of students in fourth or eighth grade who had attained basic proficiency in math and reading. We compared the change in those four percentages\\xa0with the national change from 2005 to 2015. Then, we cross-referenced those changes with the increase in charter school student enrollment as a percentage of public school enrollment. (In other words, if there were 10 charter and 20 public school students in 2005 and 15 charter and 25 public in 2015, the percent change was from 50 percent to 60 percent 4 an increase of 10 percentage points.) Overall, the correlation was small, meaning that you couldn 9t predict an increase in achievement in math and reading proficiency based on the increase in charter school enrollment. The strongest link was in eighth-grade reading scores. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/winSKzmD8j-aFboAH9lhHFycC9I=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V4G2HYVFGU3PBBS2L6AM2L4KWY.jpg)  There was an outlier that DeVos should have championed, and it wasn 9t Florida: Arizona saw a big increase in charter-school enrollment and big gains in proficiency in the state 9s public schools. In three of the four grade- subject combinations, Florida did better than the nation overall. In all four, Michigan did worse. Looking at the six states with the biggest shift to charter-school enrollment (picking six because it includes Michigan), results were mixed. In eighth- grade reading and math, four of the six states outperformed national gains between 2005 and 2015. In fourth-grade reading, half did. In fourth-grade math proficiency, only two of six did. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8cGiCQg_xgM2WjwXVowVvRwXu6E=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RI3RQ5B5L43L7JGKOMZJNRM4DI.jpg)  Our analysis above doesn 9t pick out specific areas within states where charter schools may have been introduced, which might show a tighter correlation. A 2016 [analysis](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/edfp_a_00240) of New York City schools found positive effects in public schools near charter programs, but that effect was linked to [increased spending](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/08/28/do- traditional-public-schools-benefit-from-charter- competition/?utm_term=.10d0bc3f6ba8) at those public schools, not necessarily increased competition. DeVos claimed that giving students a choice of schools improved public schools. In states where more students took the choice to enroll in nonpublic schools, though, the results have been fairly scattershot. Meaning it was easy for Stahl and c60 Minutes to introduce an example where DeVos 9s rhetoric clearly doesn 9t capture reality. That it was DeVos 9s home state made it all the more possible that Stahl would ask DeVos to explain the discrepancy. Yet, somehow, she wasn 9t ready to do so. ] ",

Given the news of Rex Tillerson's departure today, it is clear Donald Trump is craving a return to the \"Apprentice\"-like board room moments of telling people on his team, \"You're Fired,\" instead of letting controversy force his hand.

      "article": "[ A single teacher can reach thousands of students in an online course, opening up a world of knowledge to anyone with an internet connection. This limitless reach also offers substantial benefits for school districts that need to save money, by reducing the number of teachers. , But in high schools and colleges, there is [mounting evidence](https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-should-take-online-courses/) that the growth of online education is hurting a critical group: the less proficient students who are precisely those most in need of skilled classroom teachers. , Online courses can be broken down into several categories, and some are more effective than others. , In cblended courses, for example, students don 9t do their work only online: They also spend time in a classroom with a flesh-and-blood teacher. [Research suggests](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23744) that students 4 at nearly all levels of achievement 4 do just as well in these blended classes as they do in traditional classrooms. In this model, online resources supplement traditional instruction but don 9t replace it. , In the fully online model, on the other hand, a student may never be in the same room with an instructor. This category is the main problem. It is where less proficient students tend to run into trouble. After all, taking a class without a teacher requires high levels of self-motivation, self-regulation and organization. Yet in high schools across the country, students who are struggling in traditional classrooms are increasingly steered into online courses. , For example, in so-called credit recovery programs, many students who have flunked a course in an old-fashioned classroom retake the class online. The negative consequences may not be obvious at first, because the [pass rates in these courses](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/schooled/2017/05/u_s_high_schools_may_be_over_relying_on_online_credit_recovery_to_boost.html) are very high and students who take them tend to graduate from high school instead of flunking out. What could be wrong with that? , But there is something wrong with it. In reality, students who complete these courses tend to do quite poorly on subsequent tests of academic knowledge. This suggests that these online recovery courses often give students an easy passing grade without teaching them very much. , Consider a [study conducted in the Chicago high schools](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19345747.2016.1168500?journalCode=uree20&). Students who had failed algebra were randomly assigned either to online or to face-to-face recovery courses. The results were clear: Students in the online algebra courses learned much less than those who worked with a teacher in a classroom. , Online courses have many real benefits, of course. They can help high achievers in need of more advanced coursework than their districts provide through other means. This is especially true in small, rural districts that offer few specialized, traditional courses for students working ahead of their grades. , A study in Maine and Vermont examined the effect of online courses on eighth graders with strong math skills in schools that didn 9t offer face-to-face algebra classes. Students were randomly assigned either to online algebra or to the less challenging, standard math offered in traditional classes. , Both groups of students were tested at the end of the school year. The online algebra students [did substantially better](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/northeast/pdf/REL_20124021.pdf) than their counterparts in standard classrooms. They were also twice as likely to complete advanced math later in high school. , In colleges, especially in nonselective and for-profit schools, online education has expanded rapidly, too, with similar effects. These schools disproportionately enroll low-income students who are often the first in their families to attend college. Such students tend to drop out of college at very high rates. Students with weak preparation don 9t fare well in online college classes, as [recent research](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20151193) by professors at Harvard and Stanford shows. , These scholars examined the performance of hundreds of thousands of students at DeVry University, a large for-profit college with sites across the country. DeVry offers online and face-to-face versions of all its courses, using the same textbooks, assessments, assignments and lecture materials in each format. Even though the courses are seemingly identical, the students who enroll online do substantially worse. , The effects are lasting, with online students more likely to drop out of college altogether. [Hardest hit](https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/ccf_20170609_loeb_evidence_speaks1.pdf) are those who entered the online class with low grades. Work by [researchers](https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-silver-lining-for-online- higher-education/) in many other colleges concurs with the DeVry findings: The weakest students are hurt most by the online format. , For those with strong academic skills, by contrast, online learning can open up amazing opportunities. , The Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a set of free, online courses in the [economics of developing countries](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/). Students who perform well in these classes can apply for a face-to-face master 9s program in economics at M.I.T. In fact, the online courses are the sole route into this special degree program. With online credit, students need to spend only one semester in Cambridge to graduate. , The M.I.T. approach reverses the high school model in which students who fail in a face-to-face class are shifted into a more challenging online format. In M.I.T. 9s program, students must first demonstrate that they can tough it out in an online class. Only then are they admitted to a rigorous, face-to- face master 9s program. , Online education is still in its youth. Many approaches are possible, and some may ultimately benefit students with deep and diverse needs. As of now, however, the evidence is clear. For advanced learners, online classes are a terrific option, but academically challenged students need a classroom with a teacher 9s support. ] ",

(Julie Jacobson/AP) On Wednesday [I looked at data highlighting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/01/24 /america-is-winning-just-not-in-places-trump-voters- live/?utm_term=.50f81e5ddeb8)\\xa0just how big the rural/urban divide is. The big cities are getting bigger and richer, while small and rural areas are losing population and declining economically as a result. That raises the question: _Why aren 9t people moving to more prosperous metropolitan areas?_ Some of the answers are policy-based and economic. [Law professor David Schleicher](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-dire- consequences-of-declining-mobility-a-long-read-qa-with-david-schleicher/) in an interview with American Enterprise Institute 9s Jim Pethokoukis observes: > So there are two related phenomenon that are happening. The first is there 9s declining mobility. That is on net, the number of people who are making moves each year has been declining, and it 9s been declining pretty dramatically since the 1970s. > > The second and I think more important phenomenon is that people are not moving from declining communities or moving to growing communities at the rate we would expect. Diminished mobility is a drag on growth, increases the wealth gap, contributes to political polarization and complicates monetary policy. ( cIt 9s a lot harder to set a single interest rate if there 9s unemployment in one place and inflation in another. d) The reason for the decline in movers, he postulates, are the disincentives to move: > State and local policy is particularly a problem for this 4 the problem of people not moving to boom areas and not moving from declining ones. \\u2026 I categorize them into two categories: limits on entry and limits on exit. > > And so the big limits on entry I discuss are land use 4 this is probably the most well discussed. \\u2026 If we don 9t build houses in Silicon Valley, people can 9t move there. What you see is prices go up rather than populations going up. > > But also occupational licensing. \\u2026 People don 9t move across state lines at the same rate as you 9d expect, so moves in-state are much higher than moves across state in licensed industries compared to comparable unlicensed industries. And this makes it harder to move. If you want to be a lawyer in California, it 9s hard to move there. You have to take a whole new bar again. It 9s costly. The lack of affordable housing is a big disincentive. A move is also much harder when you own rather than rent. ( cThe fact that we subsidize homeownership so much limits mobility because you have to sell your house and there can be lock in. There are a whole variety of other policies that have the effect of making it costly to move. d) And that goes to the efficacy of the mortgage interest tax deduction. Schleicher emphasizes zoning policies that limit the housing stock. He 9d like to see a different approach, called a czoning budget. He explains that crather than deciding on individual projects, the city would decide on an overall amount of housing it was going to allow to have built. And this process would force cities to consider the broader economic considerations and kind of housing needs in a jurisdiction and not just on what 9s going on in their neighborhood. It is certainly the case that wealthy enclaves don 9t necessarily want more housing (they like their expensive and exclusive neighborhoods) and that there are geographic limits on the amount of housing you can fit into, say, Manhattan. (The latter might be addressed by some cost-effective public transportation so people can more easily commute from suburbs.) Schleicher suggests a rather tough solution: Tell prosperous cities they have to create so much new housing, and\\xa0impose consequences if they fall short. Schleicher thinks boosting mobility is cmuch, much more important than the tax plan. He explains that if you move to a more populous place with more people, you 9ll be the beneficiary of a more dynamic environment. ( cYou go to California and just get smarter by being around the heady brew of tech people, where you go to New York and your human capital develops because you 9re surrounded by people in the same industry or whatever it is. d) Now, I can hear the hollering from red America. _But we don 9t want to leave! We don 9t want to be urban dwellers!_ Well, first, no one is talking about forcing people to move; this is about removing barriers to move. Moreover, with adequate transportation, people can live in leafy suburbs and exurbs. However, the resistance to moving does relate to personal responsibility. Ironically, the immigrants whom Trump demonizes are setting the example. They bravely uproot themselves to make a better life for themselves and their families. (Because the entrepreneurial people are the ones who tend to leave their native countries, we get the benefit of hard-working, motivated immigrants. Someone should explain to Trump that this is why people leaving cshithole countries are a gift to the United States.) Perhaps native-born Americans should adopt the same mentality. If they want a better life, they might need to go where there are jobs already. This isn 9t like getting on a clipper ship to travel thousands of miles, never to see one 9s family again. (That 9s why there 9s Skype.) It 9s a recognition of reality. Waiting for business to move forward- leaning industries to your rural community or small town may be unrealistic. Sometimes moving the workers is a whole lot easier than moving the industrial park. This is not a simple issue, which is why Beltway politicians have so little interest in it. That does not mean states and local governments shouldn 9t be thinking creatively. (Using the unemployment benefit system to fund relocation is just one example.) Unfortunately, this president thrives on dividing Americans and likes to paint blue cities as bastions of crime and illegal, non-English speakers.

      "article": "[ LONDON 4 For the first time in the near millennium of Oxford University 9s existence, incoming female students this year outnumbered their male peers. , According to data released by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, 1,070 women won undergraduate places to start at Oxford last fall, compared with 1,025 men. , In historic terms, the small, numeric difference is less an advance than a catching up. Although for most the 20th century fewer women made it to British universities than men, that [divide was overcome](http://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp- content/uploads/2016/05/Boys-to-Men.pdf) in the 1990s, and by 2000 more than 133,000 women earned a first degree, the equivalent of a bachelor 9s in the United States, as opposed to fewer than 110,000 men. By 2011, women had completed 197,565 first degrees, versus 153,235 men. , In 2016, the Higher Education Policy Institute released [a report](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/12/university-gender- gap-scandal-thinktank-men) calling the gender gap in Britain a cnational scandal 4 only by this point it was male enrollment lagging female by 9.2 percentage points. The group proposed a ctake our sons to university day to try to correct the imbalance. , The gender gap in the United States is even more pronounced, with women making up 56 percent of college and university students in fall 2017, the Department of Education [reported](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_303.70.asp). , Things are different in the elite universities in America. Harvard 9s current freshman class, for instance, is just under 50 percent female, while Stanford 9s is 51 percent female. , Thomas A. DiPrete, the Giddings professor of sociology at Columbia University and co-author of cThe Rise of Women on the gender gap in education, said that elite institutions maintain a closer gender balance because they get so many highly qualified applicants that they can select students with the aim of achieving a well-rounded class. , It is among students from lower-socioeconomic status backgrounds that the ratio of women and men earning college degrees has changed most dramatically in recent decades, Dr. DiPrete said. In the mid-20th century, he said, cthe biggest gender gap in favor of the boys was among the less educated. It was the college educated parents where the gap was small. And that flipped. , Education experts welcomed the news about Oxford. cIt is a significant moment, said Nick Hillman, a former government adviser and director of the Higher Education Policy Institute. cWe don 9t know if this is a trend, but it probably is part of one, he said, adding that results showed girls progressively outperforming boys throughout the education system. , Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a leading gender- equality charity, also hailed the announcement, but said it was only a step in a longer process. ,  cIt is good to see this progress at Oxford, but what matters is which subjects they are studying and what happens when they leave, she said. cWe know that women are still underrepresented in math, science and engineering subjects, and that female graduates experience a pay gap on entering the workplace. , Oxford and Cambridge have faced persistent criticism for favoring graduates of Britain 9s elite cpublic schools, expensive private boarding schools like Eton and Harrow. In 2015 nearly one in three Oxford colleges failed to admit a single black British high school graduate, according to David Lammy, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party who accused the university of csocial apartheid over its admissions policies. , Oriel College, Oxford, was at the center of highly charged protests from students who campaigned, unsuccessfully, for the removal of a [statue of Cecil Rhodes](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/world/europe/oxford-university- oriel-college-cecil-rhodes-statue.html), an imperialist benefactor seen by many as an architect of apartheid. Some black students likened the memorial to erecting a statue of Hitler. , Oxford University itself gave the enrollment news a cautious welcome, saying in a statement that it ccan 9t say for certain whether this is the first time in history that Oxford has let in more women than men. ,  cAnd while it 9s too early to call this a trend based on one year 9s numbers, it is a welcome sign of progress for female applicants to Oxford, the statement said. , Officials at Oxford say they are unsure why women have been underrepresented, though Mr. Hillman said that an involved interview procedure may skew the admissions process. After students are evaluated based on grades, predicted examination results and sometimes tests, those making the cut are interviewed by their prospective tutors, who make the final decisions on admittance. ,  cEverybody thinks they are being totally fair and are choosing on potential, Mr. Hillman said of the interviews, cbut all the evidence is of unconscious bias 4 that we choose people who look and think like us. , The changing numbers may therefore also reflect the growing proportion of female academics. , The first woman to be appointed to a full professorship at Oxford was Agnes Headlam-Morley, who became Montague Burton professor of international relations in October 1948. In 2016 another milestone was passed when Louise Richardson became the university 9s first female vice chancellor. , Oxford describes itself as the coldest university in the English-speaking world, and on its website says cthere is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. , Academic halls for women were established in 1878, but it was not until 1920 that women were allowed full membership at Oxford, allowing them to graduate. Five of its all-male colleges admitted women in 1974, with all eventually admitting both women and men. ] ",

      "article": "[ \"I'm going to fight back,\" Warren said. \"The American people have not forgotten. Millions of people lost their jobs. Millions of people lost their savings.\" Progressive Democrats also seized on a report by the Congressional Budget Office released Monday evening that showed the bill would increase the federal deficit by $671 million and increase the likelihood a Wall Street mega-bank will fail. \"The independent budget scorekeeper confirmed what we know -- this bank giveaway bill will cost taxpayers,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"Hard working Americans shouldn't have to pay for favors to Wall Street, foreign mega-banks and their lobbyists.\" Warren and Brown both expressed frustration with those moderate Democrats for providing Republicans with the necessary votes to pass the bill. But unlike Warren, many of the measure's Democratic co-sponsors hail from rural states won by President Donald Trump. They argue they must respond to the distinct political and banking needs in their states, which they say have been hurt by consolidation in the banking industry since Dodd-Frank was enacted. Their support for the long-sought reform may also demonstrate to their voters, many who voted for Trump, that they can work with the president and not reflexively oppose anything he supports. \"When we passed Dodd-Frank, it was to stop the biggest guys from tanking the economy again,\" said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who supports the bill. \"We've seen the regulation bleed down. In Montana, we went from 72 community banks to 47.\" Other centrist Democratic backers include Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. \"After years of bipartisan work to advance regulatory relief for the community banks and credit unions across Indiana, I'm pleased that the full Senate will debate the legislative package I negotiated,\" Donnelly said in a statement. \"This legislation would make it easier for Hoosier families to gain access to mortgages and small businesses to access capital, and it also includes important new consumer protections, such as free credit freezes, in response to the Equifax data breach.\" Backers of the plan argue that smaller banks shouldn't have to face the same set of strict rules as behemoth Wall Street banks that could endanger the entire financial system if they go under. In a pen-and-pad with reporters on Tuesday, four moderate Democrats -- Heitkamp, Tester, Donnelly and Warner -- tried to dispel mischaracterizations of the bill. \"I am not going to let this legislative history be papered with misconceptions of this bill,\" Heitkamp said. Other co-sponsors come from purple states, like Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Gary Peters of Michigan. The new Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones, is also a supporter. \"I'm very worried about the consolidation of the banking industry in Virginia,\" said Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016 and who describes himself as a \"huge\" supporter of Dodd-Frank. \"But I believe a consequence of it has been to accelerate consolidation of banks.\" Brown dismissed questions about the political divisions in his party and blasted his colleagues for supporting a bill that he said would make the banking system less safe. \"I don't have an opinion on how it should play in the midterms,\" Brown said. \"I wonder how it's going to play out in the next 10 years if we start rolling back Wall Street rules. I'm between concerned and alarmed about what my colleagues are doing on weakening bank rules.\" Warner acknowledged the division in the Democratic caucus but expressed optimism the party could work through changes to improve the bill. \"We feel very good about getting through this process,\" Warner told reporters. The biggest change in the bill would raise the trigger at which banks are considered \"too big to fail\" from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion in assets. That means more than two dozen banks would be shielded from some of the Federal Reserve's oversight. It would also exempt American operations of big foreign banks, like Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Banco Santander. Proponents of the Dodd-Frank law have sharply criticized the bill, arguing it would weaken protections aimed at keeping the financial system safe from another crisis. \"The provisions of the bill, particularly when coupled with the clearly expressed deregulatory agenda of the Trump administration and its key financial regulators, will once again put us on the path of exposing American taxpayers, our financial system, and our economy to significant risk,\" Phil Angelides, a former chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, said in a statement. ] ",

Students walked out of school to protest gun violence in the biggest demonstration yet of the student activism that has emerged in response to last month 9s massacre of 17 people at Florida 9s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\\xa0 (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) It 9s been a common refrain for years that young people are not engaged in the political process 4 and that a big part of the reason is that schools have failed to teach them civic education. Now that we seem to have entered a new era of protest 4 started by student survivors of a mass school shooting in Florida 4 it would appear that a lot of kids are learning in school to be active citizens by thinking creatively about how to solve problems and taking action to reach their goals. Last week, many thousands of students around the country walked out of class for a 17-minute protest to mark the one-month anniversary of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting deaths of 17 people 4 and in some cases, students were punished for doing so. On Saturday, student-led protests across the country are calling on adults to take action to make kids safer. This post, by law professor Shelley Dunck, explores a different way to look at what those students did: use the lessons they have learned in school to promote a civic goal. Dunck is the director of the Business Law Clinic at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a Public Voices Fellow with The OpEd Project, an effort to expand the range of voices speaking out in the public square on critical issues. **By Shelley Dunck** Some school officials were not happy when kids walked out of class this month to participate in a national protest against gun violence 4 and they punished the students for it. But instead of viewing the young people primarily as rule-breakers, they could have chosen to applaud the students for putting into practice class lessons on civic engagement and problem-solving. In response to the student walkouts last week on the one-month anniversary of the Feb. 14 killings of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., some high school administrators gave students detention, marked the kids truant or otherwise [punished students ](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u =http- 3A__goo.gl_zT4V3z&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=GmoBArA9uoOHdqFAi5tjRg0Qvl5sjR7mDsJuhLp1zaA&m=gU7jqkRVMaq91V0LTiASoAj3WXNJCKm8LkxCZfuz3Ps&s=GK5mhpVTAqVaWrvJon7hC84JOuU_B2Onra_bkSq4LWY&e=)who elected to participate in these peaceful protests.

What these school officials fail to recognize is that the motive of these students was not to waste time or disrespect school authority, but, rather, to challenge assumptions and engage in what educators would describe as experiential learning. The actions of these students can be seen as applied learning successes. The average high school student studies history and government, prepares and delivers presentations on various topics to their fellow classmates, performs analytical arguments, writes persuasive papers and completes research projects in the school setting. By organizing meaningful protests, these students are actively practicing the application of this knowledge in a truth-to-power fashion. They are engaging in critical reflection, deliberation, and individual and coordinated communication. The result is a well-organized public display of what can accurately be described as enhanced problem-solving activities. Isn 9t this what parents, educators and everybody else in this country want from our children and young adults? Certainly schools cannot allow student demonstrations and protests to disrupt the school schedule every day. And there will always be questions about what issues rise to the level of importance to permit such disruption. But the fact that it is hard to draw a line does not take away from the fact that there are certain historic instances where well-organized and meaningful protest in high schools should be respected by school administrators and recognized by all as the educational opportunities they represent. The goal of high school is to prepare young people for adulthood. The reaction of principals and administrators to punish the behavior of the students who walked out to protest gun violence contradicts the mission of our secondary-level learning institutions: to prepare young adults to think and advocate for themselves so that they may be productive future contributors both individually and for the collective good of our country. Understanding this, many school districts have been supportive of these student efforts, acknowledging the students 9 right to peacefully protest and emphasizing the cteachable moment.

The coordinated and well-communicated efforts of students at the school are clearly taken from the playbook of high school students across the country who are organizing coordinated peaceful protests of gun violence to send a message to lawmakers to enact gun control laws. As a clinical professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, where I oversee a clinic where students deal with real clients, I witness experiential learning every day.\\xa0 Our students work with for-profit and non-profit start-ups, and these opportunities are often the first opportunity in law school that they have to experience actual interaction with a client. In these moments, students truly understand how their classroom knowledge can be applied in a meaningful way. The experience is always transformative. Now students in Parkland 4 along with others around the country 4 are advocating for their personal safety and on behalf of classmates who were among the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\\xa0 by a 19 -year-old with an AR-15 magazine-fed semi-automatic rifle. Their actions are already creating change 4 the Florida legislature has already passed gun control restrictions (though it did not pass an automatic weapons ban sought by Parkland students). By organizing and participating in peaceful protest around issues of safety, fairness and respect, these high school students are\\xa0 problem-solving by translating and actively applying skills that they have learned and practiced in the classroom to problems they see in the world around them. The opportunity to organize and communicate one 9s views to the outside world is valuable, empowering and in line with these educational goals. To\\xa0 view this in any other way is a disservice to our students. ] ",

      "article": "[  American women don 9t earn as much as men do, a persistent phenomenon that can 9t be explained by disparities in education, opportunity or child- bearing. But a growing body of research points to a new and compelling cause: Women make less because of the sexual harassment they face at work. The gender-pay gap has hovered under 80 percent for nearly two decades. Most of the discrepancy is because men work in higher-paying jobs and in more lucrative fields, and most of the policy remedies have focused on encouraging women to pursue those same, high-paying opportunities. Months of revelations about sexual harassment and abuse of women across industries shed new light on why women don 9t clean in to higher-paying jobs more often. Whether they 9re earning more because they 9re in more lucrative fields or because they have more senior positions, big paycheck jobs also often pose higher risks of sexual harassment, says [Joni Hersch](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/econ/bio/joni-hersch \"Joni Hersch\"), an economist at [Vanderbilt University](/quote/708368Z:US \"Company Overview\").     What 9s more, women who experience sexual harassment at work are six- and-a-half times more likely to leave their jobs compared with women who don 9t, according to [research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243217704631 \"The Economic Effects of Sexual Harassment on Working Women\") by [Amy Blackstone](https://umaine.edu/sociology/faculty-and-staff/amy-blackstone/ \"Amy Blackstone\"), [Christopher Uggen](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/uggen001 \"Christopher Uggen\") and [Heather McLaughlin](https://sociology.okstate.edu/people/directories/faculty-directory /dr-heather-mclaughlin \"Heather McLaughlin\"). In one of the only studies that looks at the effects of sexual harassment over time, the sociologists asked about 1,000 men and women if they had experienced unwanted touching, offensive jokes and other behaviors that could be considered workplace harassment. Among the female respondents who said they experienced unwanted touching or at least two of the other, non-physical behaviors, 80 percent said they left their jobs within two years. When these women leave their jobs, Blackstone said, they don 9t tend to trade up. They land in less lucrative fields or positions, a negative economic impact on women that persists through the rest of their working years.  8It Crushed Me 9 Not long ago, Samantha Ainsley was on the academic fast-track, pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at MIT, imagining a future of research, consulting and maybe starting her own company.  Then she was assaulted by one of the leading professors in her field at a conference. When she rebuffed him, she says, he continued to try to grab her and accused her of sleeping with fellow students to advance her career. For Ainsley, it was a life-changing event. cAll I could think about is, this guy is going to review all of my papers, she says. cIt crushed me.     A few months later, she left her program at MIT to work as a software engineer at Google, which she described as ca much more modest career than I had aspired to originally. I had to, in a sense, start over.  Lower Pay Understanding exactly how much harassment affects earning power isn 9t easy, said Claudia Goldin, a Harvard professor who studies the gender-pay gap. Abuse at work is notoriously under-reported, especially at professional and managerial levels. Someone who experienced harassment may ultimately leave her job for an unrelated reason, which wouldn 9t show up in traditional economic analysis. ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iUPnqdbexDMk/v1/60x-1.png) At the same time, jobs and fields that are dominated by women are considered csafer, according to Hersch 9s research. They also usually pay less. Kristian Lum was working as a data scientist in academia when she was groped at a professional conference, an incident that, she says, prompted her to look for work in a new field. She now works at a nonprofit, in a job that pays less and offers less security than if she 9d stayed put.  cI was looking to get away, she said. cThere was a general feeling of, 8I just don 9t want to be around this. 9  Why Women Leave There are many factors that influence a woman 9s career path, but even having children -- that notorious career-killer -- may not prompt the same adverse consequences as harassment and its effects on job satisfaction and performance. Of female engineers who quit or changed jobs over the five years ending in 2012, only one-third left to take care of children, according to a 2014 study by [Nadya Fouad](http://uwm.edu/education/people/fouad-nadya/ \"Nadya Fouad\"), a distinguished professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. The majority left for better opportunities, broadly defined, in other fields or companies. Similarly, a 2014 study of 25,000 [Harvard Business School](/quote/0358961Z:US \"Company Overview\") graduates found that only 11 percent of female Baby Boomers and Gen Xers had left the workforce to care for children -- and even among those women, the majority left primarily because they saw few prospects for advancement.  Hazard Premium Women who persist in hostile environments do earn more. Hersch, the Vanderbilt professor, studies hazard pay -- the premium workers require to work in dangerous environments. Traditionally, researchers have used on-the-job fatalities or physical injury to assess whether compensation accounts for physical risk. Hersch looked at complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to determine whether companies facing sexual harassment allegations also had to pay workers more. In fact, they do. Women earn on average an extra 25 cents an hour at such companies. Men in jobs known to be hostile earn even more: an extra 50 cents an hour, according to Hersch 9s research. For many, a higher paycheck isn 9t worth the difficulties of staying in a hostile workplace. Women who experience harassment can lose their drive or develop anxiety and depression, any of which can have an adverse impact on productivity or performance, according to [Lisa Kath](http://www.psychology.sdsu.edu/people/lisa-kath/ \"Lisa Kath\"), a psychology professor at [San Diego State University](/quote/27227MF:US \"Company Overview\") who studies workplace harassment. And when those things start to suffer, opportunities for professional advancement -- and higher earning power -- also decline.  ] ",

      "article": "[  [Uber Technologies Inc. ](/quote/0084207D:US \"Company Overview\")halted autonomous vehicle tests after one of its cars struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in what is likely the first pedestrian fatality involving the technology. The 49-year-old woman, Elaine Herzberg, was crossing the road outside of a crosswalk when the Uber vehicle operating in autonomous mode under the supervision of a human safety driver struck her, according to the Tempe Police Department. After the incident, which happened at 10 p.m. local time on Sunday, she was transferred to a nearby hospital, where she died from her injuries. \"Uber is assisting and this is still an active investigation,\" Liliana Duran, a Tempe police spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.    > Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona.

One analyst has estimated Alphabet 9s Waymo unit is worth at least $70 billion. The fatality in Tempe could slow testing, delay commercialization and undermine such optimism. Testing has expanded to complex urban areas as states like Arizona and Texas take a light-touch regulatory approach and companies race to be first to commercialize the technology. That 9s helped improved the systems, but also increased the chance of a pedestrian death. Experts have long worried about the impact deadly crashes could have on the nascent industry. \"We 9re within the phase of autonomous vehicles where we 9re still learning how good they are. Whenever you release a new technology there 9s a whole bunch of unanticipated situations,\" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University 9s business school. \"Despite the fact that humans are also prone to error, we have as a society many decades of understanding of those errors.\" The National Transportation Safety Board is opening an investigation into the death and is sending a small team of investigators to Tempe, about 10 miles east of Phoenix. The Department of Transportation 9s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dispatched a special crash investigation team.     The NTSB opens relatively few highway accident probes each year, but has been closely following incidents involving autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles. Last year, it partially faulted Tesla Inc. 9s Autopilot system for a fatal crash in Florida in 2016. The NTSB 9s cautionary tone on the emergence of self-driving technology contrasted with the Department of Transportation, which revised its policy on self-driving vehicles last year in an attempt to remove obstacles to the testing of such vehicles. \"As always we want the facts, but based on what is being reported this is exactly what we have been concerned about and what could happen if you test self-driving vehicles on city streets,\" said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group. \"It will set consumer confidence in the technology back years if not decades. We need to slow down.\" The Phoenix area is a fertile ground for experiments in the technology. Uber has been testing there with safety drivers behind the wheel. Late last year, Alphabet Inc. 9s Waymo, which has tested in the Phoenix area for years, began removing the safety drivers to transport a small number of residents. (Waymo staff sit in the back seat.) General Motors Co. is also testing in the Phoenix area. A GM spokesman declined to comment, and a representative from Waymo didn 9t return multiple requests for comment.  **For more on Uber, check out the\\xa0 _Decrypted_ \\xa0 podcast:**     \"Public safety is our top priority, and we are in communication with law enforcement, which is investigating the accident and gathering facts, as well as Uber,\" a spokesman for Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said. Uber has had incidents in the past. Last year, Uber suspended its self-driving car program after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a [high- impact crash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-25/uber- autonomous-vehicle-gets-in-accident-in-tempe-arizona \"Uber to Suspend Autonomous Tests After Arizona Accident\") in Tempe. The Uber vehicle was not responsible for the incident, and there were no injuries, the police said at the time. \"Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer,\" Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell said in a statement on Monday. \"Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe Police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.\"  _ 4 With assistance by Alan Levin, Ryan Beene, and Polly Mosendz_  ] ",

      "article": "[ ![Jake](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1090A/production/_99805876_jake.jpg)Image copyrightJAKE RUSBYImage caption Jake Rusby left after just three years  \"Lesson planning, marking, carrying out assessments, parents evenings - there was always something to do. \"I felt very much under pressure to move children on in their learning, to meet their targets,\" says Jake Rusby, who left teaching after three years. \"I was consumed by the work, I became quite anxious - it took over my life.\" Jake's story is not uncommon, and now the Department for Education is under fire from MPs for \"failing to get a grip\" on teacher retention in England. In a report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says the DfE does not have a coherent plan to tackle teacher retention and development.    The report says the number of qualified teachers leaving the profession - for reasons other than retirement - increased from 6% (25,260) of the qualified workforce in 2011 to 8% (34,910) in 2016. It says the issue is particularly critical in England's secondary schools, with the number of teachers falling by 10,800 (5%) between 2010 and 2016, from 219,000 to 208,200. This comes at a time when secondary school pupil numbers are set to increase by 540,000 (19%) between 2017 and 2025. \"The failure of the department to get to grips with the number of teachers leaving puts additional pressure on schools faced with rising numbers of children needing a school place and the teachers to teach them,\" the report says.  'You could work all day every day' It says workload is the main reason teachers are leaving and criticises the DfE for not setting out what impact its interventions on this matter are having. \"We do not expect the department to prescribe how many hours teachers should work but do expect it to understand and have a view on the relationship between workload and retention,\" it adds. For Jake Rusby, a heavy workload was very much an issue. \"I spent every hour either working or thinking about work - during the week and at weekends,\" he says. \"You could work all day every day pretty much and still not get everything done. \"I didn't see much of my young daughter at the time.\" Jake says that when he left the profession to set up his own business, it was a relief both for him and for his family. \"When I left, my wife said she felt like she'd got me back again,\" he says.  What does the government say? The DfE says there are record numbers of teachers in schools and that last year, 32,000 trainee teachers were recruited, in spite of a competitive labour market. \"Retention rates have been broadly stable for the past 20 years, and the teaching profession continues to be an attractive career,\" said a spokeswoman.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The DfE says it is investing in teacher recruitment  \"We are consulting on proposals to improve and increase development opportunities for teachers across the country and working with teachers, unions and Ofsted to tackle unnecessary workload with specific support for teachers at the start of their careers. \"Alongside this we continue to offer financial incentives to attract the brightest and best into our classrooms.\"  What do head teachers say? Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the PAC report was concerning, but came as no surprise. \"Anyone working in a school knows how rewarding it is to help young people learn and grow. On a good day, there's no better profession to be in,\" he said. \"The trouble is our teachers work longer hours for less money compared to their peers around the world. \"Today's graduates are attracted to other professions, and current teachers are leaving in search of other careers.\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the current situation had been \"brewing for several years\". \"Ministers spent too long in a state of denial, and having belatedly woken up to the problem have failed to put in place a coherent strategy and have focused instead on piecemeal initiatives. It has been a case of too little too late,\" he said. Mr Barton said the ASCL was keen to work with the new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, \"to solve a crisis which will become much worse - unless action is taken urgently - because pupil numbers are rising significantly and many more teachers will be needed\".  ] ",

That is fact and not a moral judgment. 9 9 , The debate has raised questions, too, about what some French men and women view as the growing influence of puritanical American sexual mores on a culture long associated with more fluid and open attitudes. , The letter, signed by women from the entertainment, publishing and academic fields, argued that supporters of the MeToo movement and a French counterpart have gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and that they have created a totalitarian climate. ,  cRape is a crime, the letter said. cBut insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression. 9 9 , In a line that drew particular outrage, the letter encouraged women cnot to feel forever traumatized by what the writers dismissed as relatively minor forms of sexual harassment. They cited, as an example, men who masturbate by rubbing themselves against women on buses or subways. , They said women could cconsider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent. , Many women said they were offended by the comment. ,  cWhen I was 19, on the bus, a guy ejaculated on my coat, Nadia Daam, a French journalist, wrote [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zappette/status/950822290186473474), where dozens of women recounted abusive experiences in public spaces. ,  cI don 9t know if it was a 8nonevent, 9 or the expression of 8sexual misery, 9 Ms. Daam continued. cBut I threw my coat away and didn 9t take the bus for two years. , Ms. Daam 9s tweets were among the many incredulous or furious reactions to the [letter](https://www.worldcrunch.com/opinion-analysis/full-translation-of- french-anti-metoo-manifesto-signed-by-catherine-deneuve). Many women found its arguments antiquated and disingenuous. , Caroline De Haas was among the French feminists who wrote that the letter reminded them of cthe embarrassing colleague or the tiresome uncle who doesn 9t understand what is happening. 9 9 , Others, however, welcomed the letter as a necessary pushback against what they view as a brand of radical feminism imported from the other side of the Atlantic. , Sarah Chiche, a psychoanalyst and writer who was one of the letter 9s main authors, accused the MeToo movement of promoting an ideology cthat values victimization. She also said in an email that the movement was showing signs of excess. ,  cMen whose only fault was sending a slightly salacious text message or email were being treated, on social networks, exactly the same way as sexual criminals, like rapists, she said. , The letter was the latest sign that the global outcry against sexual misconduct and sexual violence in the wake of the [Harvey Weinstein](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/harvey-weinstein?8qa) revelations is meeting [cultural resistance](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual- harassment.html) in France. , But there are indications, too, that some of the resistance is being chipped away and that French attitudes toward gender relations and workplace harassment have shifted. , Referring to the signers and supporters of the public letter, Genevi\\xe8ve Fraisse, a French philosopher who writes about feminist thought, said, cThey are in the minority, but they had not understood that they were in the minority. 9 9 , These views were majority opinions cwhen D.S.K. happened, she added, referring to the[ sexual assault scandal ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/world/europe/dsk-acquitted-aggravated- pimping-charges.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FStrauss- Kahn%2C%20Dominique&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection)that engulfed Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011, when he was managing director of the International Monetary Fund. , French newspapers have been awash with commentary supporting or criticizing the letter. Le Monde splashed three op-ed essays and an interview across its opinion pages on Thursday, under the tag cThe fractures of feminism. , Lib\\xe9ration ran photos on its front page of Ms. Deneuve and two other women who endorsed the letter, with the headline: cSexual freedom threatened, really? , An agent for Ms. Deneuve said Thursday that she did not want to comment further. , Ten years ago, can op-ed like that one would have had a lot more support in France, Ms. De Haas said in a telephone interview. , The French equivalent to the MeToo movement, known as BalanceTonPorc (which translates as ExposeYourPig), chas had consequences that I think are very profound, she said. , The debate even reached the highest levels of French government. Marl\\xe8ne Schiappa, France 9s junior minister for gender equality, called the letter a potpourri of ideas, some of which were cnot uninteresting, while others were cprofoundly shocking. ,  cWe have immense difficulty convincing young women that when a man rubs his genitals against a woman in the m\\xe9tro without her consent, it is an act of sexual assault that can lead to three years in prison and a 75,000 euro fine, she [told France Culture radio](https://www.franceculture.fr/societe/pour-marlene-schiappa-la-tribune- des-100-femmes-comporte-des-choses-profondement-choquantes-voire-fausses) on Wednesday. , Ms. Schiappa is working on legislation the government hopes to get approved this year that would create [fines for street harassment and catcalling](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/europe/france-harassment- twitter-weinstein.html). , But Christophe Castaner, a colleague of Ms. Schiappa 9s in the government, told France Info radio that the letter made valid points about the risks of a society cwhere some words are banned, where humor is banned, where schoolboy jokes can be banned. ,  cI 9m always afraid of the standardization of attitudes, of a unique model of behaving, of a sort of Americanization that we know about, where a man today can never ride an elevator with a woman, said Mr. Castaner, who is also the head of La R\\xe9publique en Marche, the centrist party of President Emmanuel Macron. , His view of the United States as a country with an absurdly puritanical streak is not new. , Supporters of MeToo insist, though, that critics like Mr. Castaner, by exaggerating the possibility of a more repressive culture, diminish the significance of the harm inflicted on women by abusive men. ,  cThis supposed Americanization of relationships is something that anti- feminists were already warning against 30 years ago, said Ms. Fraisse, the philosopher. , Eric Brion, the former head of a French television channel, was accused by a journalist in October of having made salacious and disrespectful advances toward her at a television festival in Cannes. , She then created the BalanceTon Porc movement. ,  cSeveral weeks after the publication of this much talked about hashtag, like many others, I have become aware of the scale of the work that is ahead of us, Mr. Brion wrote in an [op-ed in Le Monde](http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2017/12/30/eric-brion-je- reclame-le-droit-a-la-verite-et-a-la-nuance_5235932_3232.html) in December, acknowledging and apologizing for the advances. , But he also noted that his comments had little to do with the accusations against Mr. Weinstein. ,  cI am simply asking for the right to truth and to nuance, Mr. Brion said. , Michelle Perrot, a prominent specialist of women 9s history at the Universit\\xe9 Paris Diderot, said in an [interview with Le Monde](http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/01/11/michelle-perrot-l -absence-de-solidarite-me-sidere_5240237_3232.html) on Thursday that she thought the letter raised valid points, mainly about the risk of can insidious moral order that might censor creativity and desire in the name of the protection of women. , But she said that accusing the MeToo movement of confining women to the role of victim was misguided. ,  cOn the contrary, this protest, both individual and collective, makes them actors who refuse and resist a pressure, a domination that they do not want, she said. , It is unclear where the majority of French men and women stand on these issues. Ms. De Haas said she thought the letter reflected cstereotypes that are held by many people in France. , But Marilyn Baldeck, a legal professional who trains employees about sexual harassment in the workplace, said that cwhen we give these people concrete examples of sexual harassment, they tend to change their minds and acknowledge how harmful some situations can be. ] ",

On the issue of whether allowing teachers to carry guns could have deterred the rampage,\\xa0a proposal Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said is an option\\xa0for schools, 42\\xa0percent said they agreed. \\u2026 > > The use of high-powered semiautomatic rifles in recent mass shootings, including by [alleged shooter Nikolas] Cruz, police say, and in last year 9s killing of 58 concertgoers in Las Vegas, has sparked calls to reinstate the 10-year ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004. > > But Americans are roughly split on this proposal, with 50\\xa0percent in support and 46\\xa0percent opposed, a stark contrast from the 80\\xa0percent support for the ban in 1994, the year it was enacted. The current level of support is little different from 51\\xa0percent in 2016. Whatever you may think of the idea, the decline in support for a ban on some types of weaponry should be a wake-up call to those looking to pass new legislation. It 9s first important to understand how this happened. The National Rifle Association has a single, undiluted message: _No restrictions on guns. People are the problem._ \\xa0But advocates for new gun laws have been all over the lot: _Restrict handguns. Restrict semiautomatic weapons. Ban dangerous people from getting guns._ They have not even found a name to identify themselves (anti-gun? gun restrictionists? anti-NRA?). They 9ve done even worse when it comes to making the case for a ban on certain classes of weapons. The NRA forces insist that the 1994 assault weapons ban was a cfailure. The counter-argument has been muddled. Aside from the shortcomings in public persuasion, those looking to ban weapons such as the AR-15 have been caught up in the culture wars. Gun ownership 4 any gun by anyone and anywhere 4 has become another tribal identity.\\xa0It 9s another box to check in setting the division between blue and red. If the issue becomes urban elites vs. rural conservatives, then the merits don 9t matter, the facts don 9t matter, and compromise 4 let alone resolution 4 becomes impossible. Plainly, for those who advocate more gun measures, the strategy must be to start small, win where they can and bring the public along on a larger message that gun rights, like First Amendment rights, are not absolute and must operate within the context of people 9s rights to safety and security. (The quintessential example of screaming cFire! in a crowded theater or prohibitions on deceptive advertising come to mind.) Meanwhile, the terms of the debate are shifting thanks to the articulate, determined student survivors of the Parkland, Fla., massacre. [The Post reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fla-school-shooting-creates- urgent-push-for-gun-control-bipartisan-calls-for- change/2018/02/19/1279e5e6-15b2-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.9ee791f71106): > President Trump said Monday that he is open to improving the background check system used to screen those who buy firearms, a measure that has bipartisan support and the backing of the National Rifle Association. Trump spoke about the legislation with one of its co-sponsors, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), on Friday. > > Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he supports gun violence restraining-order laws, which allow firearms to be seized before a person commits a violent act. The laws have been gaining conservative backers in the wake of the Parkland shooting, which killed 17 people, most of them teenagers. \\u2026 Ironically, the Parkland students have intuitively reached the most effective legislative strategy. They support _anything_ that might have any effect in diminishing gun violence. Even if the Cornyn-Murphy registration measure is simply to improve the existing system, and even if it is so mild that even the NRA supports it, they should take it if they can get it. The same is true on banning so-called bump stocks. (Didn 9t Trump promise to look at that, too?) Restraining orders to remove guns from the hands of dangerous people, at least temporarily, subject to a court hearing, may be the boldest idea in years on the topic. ( cThere is now hope that restraining- order laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, will gain momentum in statehouses. 8It is a law that allows for due process, and it gives family members and law enforcement tools to remove guns from a tragedy before a tragedy occurs, 9 said Andrew Patrick, a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\\xa0Patrick said it is 8huge 9that Rubio supports the laws and that there was\\xa0an article\\xa0in the conservative National Review urging Republicans to support the measures. d) And if we can get more than vocal support for mental-health services 4 to fully fund mental-health services for the poor, for example 4 that would be a victory as well. In this arena, I truly believe success will beget success. Once gun-safety advocates can demonstrate that they don 9t want to ban all guns, and once gun advocates can show some awareness that gun absolutism is politically unsustainable, further efforts can be undertaken. In short, resetting the needle from absolutely no gun laws to some gun laws would be a major accomplishment. **Read more by Jennifer Rubin:** [McConnell owes the country a fuller explanation on Russian meddling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/02/20 /mcconnell-owes-the-country-a-fuller-explanation-on-russian- meddling/?utm_term=.f52ebd176207) [Taking after the boss, Trump 9s staff is learning all the wrong lessons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/02/20/taking- after-the-boss-trumps-staff-is-learning-all-the-wrong- lessons/?utm_term=.2b181c5dbc4b) [Two really bad defenses for Trump when it comes to Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/02/20/two- really-bad-defenses-for-trump-when-it-comes-to-russia/?utm_term=.bf9fe4b7bff3) [Morning Bits: Facebook faces a furious backlash](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/02/20 /morning-bits-facebook-faces-a-furious-backlash/?utm_term=.1f54e7567750) ] ",

And then there 9s cNosedive, the episode set in a world where a person 9s life depends on their rating out of\\xa0five on a social media app 4[ enter China 9s idea for a csocial credit system](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/chinese-government-social-credit-score- privacy-invasion). But cBlack Mirror is also about the present. The anthology series 9 futuristic technologies of varying plausibility are used as vessels to say something about what we 9re capable of doing to ourselves and to each other 4 right now. **\\xa0** In\\xa0Season 4 9s\\xa0six episodes,\\xa0which premiered Friday on Netflix, human beings, not technology, are the scariest things.  cCrocodile, a bleak and difficult episode co-starring Andrea Riseborough and a tone-perfect Icelandic landscape, is a story about a successful woman who kills people\\xa0to protect her past from ruining her future. The technology is a powerful machine that collects memories, controlled by a smart, ethical and kind insurance investigator played by Kiran Sonia Sawar. The technology isn 9t\\xa0the reason Riseborough 9s character begins to kill; instead, it 9s a figure from her past who\\xa0plans to dredge\\xa0up their mutual secret using the most analog of media: an anonymous letter sent to the police. The technological trick that makes cUSS Callister 4 **\\xa0** widely considered the standout episode of the season ** 4** \\xa0possible is one Brooker has used before on cBlack Mirror. It 9s a good one: Place\\xa0a real human consciousness into the line of fire of the sort of human cruelty we 9re capable of through technology 4 when we think no one is looking, or no one can hold us accountable. In cCallister, those consciousnesses live inside a private, simulation video game controlled by Robert Daly, the quiet IRL CTO of a tech company, played by\\xa0Jesse Plemons. During his downtime at home **,** Daly\\xa0built a simulator to let him be the captain aboard the USS Callister 4 the spaceship from his favorite TV show. His crew comprises the stolen, captive human consciousnesses of several of his co-workers, each of whom has committed some perceived slight against Plemons 9s character in the real world. All Daly needs to do to create a new prisoner is steal a sample of their DNA, which he does to his new employee,\\xa0Nanette Cole (Cristin Milioti). Cole, who is kind and admiring of Daly 9s work, doesn 9t smile at him enough once, earning her DNA a one-way trip to the Callister. The episode jumps back and forth between Daly 9s world and the real world, as the imprisoned Cole consciousness tries to free herself and her fellow co- worker clones from Daly 9s godlike control. The successful\\xa0episode accomplishes two things at once: It 9s a thrilling space adventure story, and it effectively embodies the cruelty of the toxic masculinity it seeks to condemn. For Daly, what might feel like an outlet for his pent-up resentment and anger from being the Nice Guy nobody appreciates is shown uncompromisingly as the violence that it really is. By 2017, a wide segment of the world 9s online population has\\xa0seen or experienced the sort of online cruelty Callister dramatizes, but the episode will have particular and obvious resonances\\xa0for women in tech and video games who have experienced\\xa0mobs of online harassment. The structure of cBlack Museum, a story about violence against black Americans, is simple enough: Nish,\\xa0played by\\xa0Letitia Wright, follows\\xa0Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge) through a tour of Haynes 9s Black Museum, a crumbling roadside attraction in the middle of the American desert. The museum is filled with technological artifacts that are each connected to a crime. Regular cBlack Mirror viewers know many of the stories already 4 the objects come from previous episodes. But not all of them: Two new ones (for viewers, at least) lead Haynes into\\xa0the mini stories that give this episode its anthology feel. In one mini-story, Haynes tells the tale of a doctor who became addicted\\xa0to the experience of feeling his patients 9 pain through a new device. The short tale is told as dark entertainment: It contains both the sort of brutal violence you 9d expect in a torture porn film and an intentionally gratuitous joke about an erection. In the second story line, a man agrees to share his brain with the consciousness of his comatose wife. When her constant presence leads to nagging and fighting, the wife is removed from her former husband 9s skull and placed into that of a stuffed toy monkey. But then the anthology premise is dropped, and the viewer learns what Haynes and, secretly, Nish, knew all along: The main attraction of the Black Museum is the imprisoned consciousness of a black man who died on death row 4 despite substantial questions over his guilt. Haynes once profited handsomely off the torture of this man 9s consciousness, allowing busloads of\\xa0giddy tourists to pull the lever and electrocute him. The most coveted souvenir of the Black Museum? A keychain that contains a piece of his consciousness at the moment of electrocution,\\xa0his face screaming in real agony, forever. The new, terrible souvenir technology comes from an old idea: Photographs of lynchings were once sold as commodities to white Americans, often in the form of a\\xa0[postcard](http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/2001/06/lynching/page1.shtml)\\xa0or [stereograph](https://books.google.com/books?id=txZ8PZRsk0YC&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=stereograph+lynching&source=bl&ots=zg_BTxOsEY&sig =qcT0uuRjPen-Qt3jXqXJ0t6ESG0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOiN2AqbfYAhWHON8KHb- tABwQ6AEINTACv=onepage&q=stereograph%20lynching&f=false). Nish visits the Black Museum when it 9s all but\\xa0abandoned by visitors, the consciousness of Haynes 9s prisoner\\xa0tortured into a vegetable-like state.\\xa0He 9s no fun to electrocute anymore, even for the hardcore sadists and white supremacists who kept Haynes 9s doors open after the waves of tourists stopped coming. Nish hasn 9t forgotten: She 9s the man 9s daughter. As she reveals who she is, she speaks about another sort of pain 4 the kind that remains when an injustice is\\xa0abandoned without being fully righted, even as other injustices are committed on top of it. It takes no future technological breakthrough to connect what Nish says to our current reality. There are resonances here with [essays, interviews and articles written by black writers](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/black-pain-gone- viral-racism-graphic-videos-can-create-ptsd-like-trauma) about the trauma of repeated, [viral](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7x94nq/viral-black-death- to-watch-or-not-to-watch), black death. More unplanned was another resonance with current events: One day after this episode was released, [Eric Garner 9s daughter Erica](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/nyregion/erica-garner-dead.html) died at the age of 27.  cEven the protesters got bored after awhile, **** soon as it was clear the state wouldn 9t do a 4 thing about clearing him, Nish says. cThey just moved on to the next viral miscarriage of justice that you could hang a hashtag off. Both cCallister and cBlack Museum have revenge endings. They 9re not quite the happy endings of cSan Junipero **\\xa0** from Season 3, or this season 9s cHang the DJ, but not as bleak and hopeless as viewers have come to dread from the show. The good\\xa0side wins;\\xa0as in Kafka 9s c[In the Penal Colony](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1500940704?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1500940704), the bad guys meet their demise through the tech they once controlled and misused. The repetition of the human consciousness theme, and the twinned revenge endings in the first and last episode of the series, are fine. But as I watched cBlack Museum, I felt as if I was seeing the show press itself up against the glass of a\\xa0paradox\\xa0it will never really be able to escape. As many have noted before, cBlack Mirror is not a show for Luddites. It invites us to enjoy and dread the possibilities presented by technology. In doing so, it also asks us to do the same of human violence. ] ",

      "article": "[ LONDON 4 Martina Navratilova said she is cextremely angry and feels let down by the BBC after learning that John McEnroe gets paid at least 10 times more than her for their broadcasting roles at Wimbledon. In a list of the BBC 9s highest-paid workers published last year, it was revealed that McEnroe earned between 150,000-199,999 pounds ($210,000-280,000) for working at Wimbledon. Navratilova said she gets paid 15,000 pounds ($21,000). Navratilova, a nine-time singles champion at the All England Club, said she was told by the BBC that she earns a ccomparable amount, so ... we were not told the truth.  cIt 9s extremely unfair and it makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this, Navratilova told cPanorama: Britain 9s Equal Pay Scandal, a program being aired on the BBC on Monday. The BBC responded to Navratilova 9s comments by saying that, as an coccasional contributor, she appears on fewer broadcasts and is on a different type of contract than McEnroe.  cJohn and Martina perform different roles in the team, and John 9s role is of a different scale, scope and time commitment, the BBC said in a statement. cThey are simply not comparable. The corporation said that while Navratilova is paid per appearance, has a fixed volume of work and has no contractual commitment, McEnroe is on call for the entire 13 days of the tournament, has a larger breadth of work 4 including radio and publicity 4 and has a contract that means he cannot work for another British broadcaster without the BBC 9s permission.  cHe is a defining voice within the BBC 9s coverage, the BBC said. cHe is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences ... His pay reflects all of this; gender isn 9t a factor. Navratilova said her agent will ask for more money in future to work for the BBC. McEnroe said he heard about the pay disparity but had no immediate comment.  cI definitely feel that at some point in the very near future, if necessary, I will respond to it. But I also believe that this isn 9t the place to discuss it, McEnroe said after a news conference Monday in Chicago for the Laver Cup.  cAnd the BBC, to my understanding, has responded and I believe in an appropriate way at least for what has been said so far. But if this keeps up and people think this is a story in a couple of days, I 9m sure at some point I 9ll have something to say about it. The gender pay gap at the BBC has been a talking point since the salaries of top BBC talent were revealed last year. A review commissioned by the BBC found a 6.8 percent gender pay gap, but cno evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "article": "[  President Donald Trump is emphasizing his vow to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and additional conditions for an immigration deal, as congressional leaders and White House officials\\xa0plan a meeting Wednesday that will set terms for a coming debate on the issue. GOP lawmakers have largely avoided talking about the border wall, a central Trump campaign promise, in negotiations with Democrats on legislation to provide protection against deportation for 800,000 young undocumented immigrants while also bolstering border security and interior enforcement of immigration laws. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said the wall remains part of the discussion. He told Fox News Tuesday, \"There is an agreement that can be reached. It 9s got to start with border security, though, and putting money in place to start building the wall as President Trump said. He campaigned on this and he won the presidency with this being a front and center issue.\" ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/icZ187j5bmXg/v1/60x-1.jpg)](https://www.bloomberg.com/features /trump-daily/) [Follow the Trump Administration 9s Every Move](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/trump-daily/)     The president said in September that he would end the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in early March. Trump has expanded his demands for what he wants in exchange for a DACA accord: eliminating family immigration preferences and ending a diversity lottery program that provides visas to people in countries with low rates of migration to the U.S. Trump punctuated the holidays with a series of tweets renewing demands that an immigration measure include a border wall, which is strongly opposed by Democrats and many Republicans in Congress. He 9s also accusing Democrats of playing politics in the debate.  cThe Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc., Trump said in a tweet Friday from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. He wrote on Tuesday, \"Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics.\"  Tax Cut Immigration is one of the top issues that Congress pushed into 2018 as Republicans who control the Senate and House focused instead on passing a massive $1.5 trillion tax-cut measure. Democrats are insisting that the next federal spending bill include protections for the undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. The White House meeting Wednesday will include White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and legislative liaison Marc Short.     Trump isn 9t alone in seeking policies that could complicate the debate. Some GOP lawmakers are pushing for a mandatory cE-Verify system for employers to ensure their workers are documented and to include deep cuts to legal immigration. Democrats insist Trump has promised he would support not only DACA protections but the cDream Act that provides the young immigrants a pathway to citizenship. The DACA expiration puts pressure on all sides to act. Some of the young immigrants have expulsion protections that expire before March, with more than 7,900 already losing DACA protections since Trump acted in September, according to the Center for American Progress in Washington, a liberal research group. That number will rise to about 22,000 people by early March, the group said. Bipartisan talks in the Senate for an immigration compromise, led by Democrat Richard Durbin of Illinois and Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, could yield comprehensive immigration legislation as early as this month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has [pledged](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-12-20/senators- closing-in-on-immigration-deal-for-action-in-january \"McConnell Promises Vote on Immigration If Deal Sealed by January\") to put such a plan on the Senate floor this month if it has broad support in both parties.  Risks in House Even if senators can reach accord, there will be risks in the House, where more Republicans are balking at the deportation protections. The last effort to enact a comprehensive immigration overhaul failed in 2013, when the Senate -- then controlled by Democrats -- [voted](/news/terminal/MP2L606TTDSZ \"Senate Passes Immigration Law Revision in Bipartisan Vote \\(1\\)\") to create a path to legal status for 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and to spend $46 billion to secure the U.S.-Mexican border. The Republican-dominated House didn 9t take up the bill, as most in the party opposed legal status. Trump 9s support for any emerging compromise involving DACA could give political cover to some House Republicans from GOP-stronghold districts, but the ideological divide over the issue runs deep in that chamber. GOP Representative Steve King of Iowa continues to oppose any protection for people who are in the U.S. illegally. Some members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, including Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, have also expressed reservations. Yet with 2018 midterm elections looming, a measure that addresses the needs of immigrants could benefit vulnerable GOP House lawmakers from districts with heavy concentrations of Latino voters. That includes Mike Coffman of Colorado, Darrell Issa of California and Carlos Curbelo of Florida.  cOn this immigration issue, it 9s the extremists on both sides that have prevented a compromise and a solution for years, Curbelo said in an [MSNBC interview](/news/terminal/P14WNS8JMDC0 \"Rep. Carlos Curbelo \\(R\\), Florida On Msnbc Kasie Dc.., sked FINAL\") last month. cPeople on the far right who call this amnesty, even though it 9s not, the people on the far left who believe this issue is so potent politically that they don 9t want it to get solved. Meanwhile, a key issue splitting both political parties is how to enact any immigration compromise that might be reached. Democrats in both chambers are pushing to include it in the next federal spending bill, which must clear by Jan. 19 or risk a government shutdown. McConnell and other GOP leaders insist that it should move through Congress on its own. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, made clear in a letter Tuesday to House Democrats that she 9ll reiterate her party 9s demand at the Wednesday meeting, which will also include discussion of spending and budget caps.  cWe are firmly committed to swiftly passing the DREAM Act, which we know would pass with bipartisan support if brought to the floor, she wrote. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said last month that Trump 9s deadline for DACA isn 9t until March and that there are other more pressing issues to deal with first. He has repeatedly said that DACA is ca separate issue that shouldn 9t be lumped together with the discussion on government spending and extending other programs.\\xa0  _ 4 With assistance by Margaret Talev_  ] ",

(Jeffrey Sauger for The Washington Post) Hillary Clinton carried counties that caccounted for nearly three-fourths of the nation 9s increased economic output and almost two-thirds of its new jobs in the years leading up to [Donald Trump 9s] election, [Ron Brownstein reminds us](http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/23/politics/economy- prosperity-paradox-divide-country-voters/index.html).\\xa0The [Brookings Institution 9s Metropolitan Policy Program](https://www.brookings.edu/blog /the-avenue/2018/01/22/uneven-growth/)\\xa0provides a wealth of data: > On population growth, for example, the 53 very largest metro areas (those with populations over one million residents) have accounted for fully 93.3 percent of the nation 9s population growth since the [financial] crisis, but an incredible 96.4 percent of it since 2014 (though they account for just 56 percent of the overall population). Even more significantly, the biggest metros generated fully two-thirds of output growth on the economic front and 73 percent of employment gains between 2010 and 2016 4figures that actually have increased since 2014, when they reached nearly 72 and 74 percent. So if voters in Trump country feel as though they are losing, they likely are. cBy contrast, smaller metropolitan areas with less than 250,000 people 4representing 9 percent of the nation 9s population 4have lost ground. Since 2010, in fact, these communities made a negative contribution of -6.5 percent to the nation 9s growth. In rural America where President Trump drew large number of votes, cnational population growth had turned negative. The divide is getting more pronounced with time: > The nation 9s bigger communities 4powered by well-educated millennial workers and the agglomeration trends brought by\\xa0digital technology 4are now growing notably faster and accounting for more and more of the nation 9s growth than before, even as small metros wane and most of the rural hinterland slides into deep decline. In short, fully half of all of the country 9s employment growth took place in just 20 metropolitan areas, home to about one-third of Americans, led by the usual suspects of New York, Boston, the Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., along with such fast-growing Sun Belt hubs as Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, and Orlando. In short, the population in big cities gets bigger and richer, while the population in smaller cities and rural areas shrinks and gets poorer. Trump 9s csolution was to scapegoat foreigners and blame elites, while increasing the divide with a tax plan heavily tilted to the rich. He is selling small-town and rural residents a bill of goods 4 or rather, raising the price of goods, by tariffs. He has made grand promises but done little to fight the opioid epidemic that has gripped rural areas, and if given their way, Republicans would slash safety net programs that Americans in these areas depend upon. If red America feels victimized by a global economy, secularization and increased diversity, blue America is rightly concerned about reactionary policies that are going to harm the parts of the country that are succeeding. (Brownstein writes: cMany public and private sector leaders in the big blue metros believe their economic success is threatened by the Trump agenda of hostility to immigration and free trade, the prioritization of tax cuts over investments in education and scientific research, the stoking of racial tensions, resistance to cultural change on issues such as gay and transgender rights, and the GOP move to limit the federal deductibility of state and local taxes. d) Surely, politicians can do better than this. There are several policy approaches that would begin to bridge the gap. First, we should encourage geographic mobility so that people can go where the jobs are. If need be, unemployment benefits should be convertible to a generous relocation subsidy. In the long run, getting people reattached to the job market and relocated to a booming area will be worth the price. Second, the jobs will come to the heartland if there is an educated workforce and sufficient infrastructure; we should invest in both. Instead of slashing revenue with unneeded tax cuts, we would do well to expend money in places where population and job opportunities have declined. Third, the irony is that immigration is part of the solution, not the problem. [Michigan](http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/economic_impact_of_immigration.html) is a perfect example of how recruiting immigrants can stoke an economic revival: > In 1990, Michigan 9s immigrant community represented 3.8 percent of the state 9s total population, according to [a 2016] report.

Of all the facts and figures trickling out of the country this past week, one number stood out: [According to Iran 9s Interior Ministry](https://twitter.com/rezahakbari/status/948566832310554624), more than 90 percent of those detained so far have an average age under 25.

Among young Iranians, who\\xa0make up half the country 9s population, 40 percent are without work or steady income. Conventional wisdom holds that Iran 9s large and restless youth population poses an inescapable and mortal threat to the Islamic system. While it 9s still too early to know definitively, these latest protests introduce the possibility that variation across post-revolutionary cohorts, and in particular improved rates of access to higher education, offers a more significant predictor for contentious politics than the long-anticipated 4 but never realized 4 reckoning between Iran 9s c[youth bulge](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-many-crises-of-iranian- youth/) and the revolution 9s aging founders. The grandchildren of Iran 9s revolution are protesting not from want of opportunity but because of its abundance. This generation is the first to have full access to higher education, but refuses to be 4 as their predecessors were 4 the last to get a job. As recently as 2006, fewer than half of all 14- to 17-year-olds were on track to graduate from high school on time, if at all, and no more than a third of those living in rural areas. [More than half](http://rc.majlis.ir/fa/report/show/800839) of these same students quit school after their first year of high school.

Many of these new entry points to university education benefited the [small-town poor](https://muftah.org/to-show-solidarity-with- protestors-in-iran-do-not-erase-the-iranian-working-class/) who constituted Ahmadinejad 9s base 4 and who are now leading the protests. If a university degree had been a distant aspiration for the children of the revolution 9s third and [fourth generations](https://newint.org/features/2007/03/01/internet), then by the end of Ahmadinejad 9s time in office it had become an obligation, a requisite for employment and marriage that quickly proved to be more of a burden than a way to get ahead. Access proved to be unbearable, and what is at stake now are the changing terms of the transition to adulthood, the implicit rules of the game that formed the contract between state and society: Go to school, get a degree, wait your turn. The emerging profiles of protesters and testimonies from the ground [present compelling evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dS4Lrhd7wk) that Iran 9s youngest citizens are refusing to play along.

While older\\xa0cohorts of Iran 9s post-revolutionary youth sit this one out, members of its rising cfifth generation, Iranians old enough to have voted for Rouhani but too young to have participated in the Green Movement, are out in the squares, taking on the authorities on a scale not seen since 2009. There is a sense that there is something different about this generation, which can be felt in the reporting from Iran. cIt 9s not our crowd this time around, a young Iranian who was active in the Green Movement [said](https://twitter.com/SanamF24/status/947891378247340037). cWe don 9t share the same grievances.

They won 9t take grief from anyone. This is a hardened bunch. Ninety percent were under 17 when the Green Movement happened, and saw firsthand the suppression of the crowds. As children, they attended to their older cousins and siblings, bringing them snacks and cups of tea, while the latter anxiously prepared for the university entrance exam in marathon study sessions. They were present at their graduations 4 as well as disappointments, as they saw how their relatives slogged in fields unrelated to their degrees. It 9s not surprising that this generation is [unwilling to accept](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/01/iran-protests-hasan-rouhani-green- movement) their current circumstances.

As I 9ve noted [elsewhere](https://muftah.org/iran-protests-extension-of-islamic- republic-ethos/.WlSsRpM-fOR), citizens take to the streets to preserve the system, to make it work for them and not against them.

The school board\\xa0plans to close four high schools in Englewood. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP) _**(Update: Board votes; correction on numbers of students affected in earlier closing)**_ The Chicago Board of Education voted on Wednesday to close four South Side high schools and one elementary school and build a new $85 million high school 4 despite fierce opposition from the community and education activities. Five years ago, Chicago officials closed nearly 50 public schools in a move that drew widespread protests from the community. Community members are angry again at the prospect of new closures, saying the plan will hurt black students from low-income families\\xa0 4 who will be sent to other schools 4 while the newly built school will primarily benefit white students. Here is a piece by Michelle Ren\\xe9e Valladares, associate director of the National Education Policy Institute at the University of Colorado at Boulder, about why closing schools is not the answer to low student performance. **By Michelle Ren\\xe9e Valladares** I 9ve never met Irene Robinson in person, but after watching her graciously and candidly share the story of the closing of her grandchildren 9s Washington Park elementary school in the new mini- documentary, [ cKings and Queens,](http://www.ourkingsandqueens.com/) I am left with the feeling that I 9ve known her for years. In 2013, members of the Chicago Board of Education approved the closing of 47 elementary schools. Despite weeks of protests by teachers, parents and community members, 12,000 students saw their schools closed and thousands more students at receiving schools were negatively impacted in the largest mass closing of neighborhood schools in\\xa0U.S.\\xa0history. At the time, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel explained the decision as a money- saving measure and promised that residents like Ms. Irene would have a say in turning the former schools into facilities that would benefit the surrounding neighborhoods. Today, two-thirds of those buildings remain vacant and there are no standards for community involvement in determining their reuse. As Chicago Public School board members 4 who will vote on new school closures 4 listen to the stories of families like the Robinsons, I hope that they take time to understand that these stories align with the vast amount of research that documents the damage school closings do to children and to communities. As a scholar at the National Education Policy Center, I can confirm that Robinson 9s story is one I and other researchers have heard over and over. In 2017, three of my colleagues at the National Education Policy Center (NEPC) examined the research on school closings. Many studies, they found, confirm that closing schools in the name of improving student achievement is a chigh-risk/low-gain strategy that fails to increase students 9 achievement or their overall well-being. Irene, a leader with the Journey For Justice Alliance and the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization, explains why. For years, Chicago Public Schools systematically starved her local school of vital resources: teachers, learning programs and even basic maintenance. Then, when student test scores did not improve in these harsh conditions, officials used those low test scores and unkempt facilities to justify closing her local school, Overton Elementary. Irene tells us that her grandchildren felt responsible for the closure. She tells us that they asked repeatedly whether district leaders thought that they were ctoo dumb to attend their own school. To add insult to injury, Irene explains that when Overton was closed, the students were assigned to two equally underfunded schools that quickly became overcrowded. Research explains that this experience is not unique. The same NEPC study found that students struggle academically, socially and emotionally after their school is closed. It is also, unfortunately, common that students from closed schools are not able to access well-resourced, high-quality schools in their district. And the evidence is clear that school closures disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. Fortunately, research also provides proactive solutions. We should engage community members and families in developing and implementing strategies for improving their schools. We should surround struggling schools with the resources and wraparound supports they need, rather than close them. And we should incorporate many more indicators other than just test scores to understand schools 9 effectiveness and where they need assistance. These are just a few of the steps Chicago Public Schools officials can take to address the challenges their schools face. What Chicago and the nation lack are not evidenced-based solutions or experts like Irene Robinson to inform them. What we collectively lack is the will to implement these long-term proven solutions. The solutions are not quick, and they are not free 4 but they do work. Again, it is my sincere hope that the leaders of Chicago Public Schools will study what works, learn from it and be brave enough to act accordingly. _**(Correction: An earlier version had an incorrect number of students who were affected by the school closings five years ago.)**_ ] ",

To his right is Maurice Kennard,\\xa0Brightwood 9s principal. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) On Oct. 28, 2015, the D.C. Public Schools district [put out a statement lauding itself](https://dcps.dc.gov/release/dc-public-schools-continues- momentum-fastest-improving-urban-school-district-country)\\xa0with this headline: cDC Public Schools Continues Momentum as the Fastest Improving Urban School District in the Country. For years, that has been the national narrative about the long-troubled school district in the nation 9s capital: After decades of low performance and stagnation, the system was moving forward with a creform program that was a model for the nation. The triumphant story included rising standardized test scores and cmiracle schools that saw graduation rates jump over the moon in practically no time. Arne Duncan, President Barack Obama 9s education secretary for seven years, called it ca pretty remarkable story in 2013. That tale is looking a lot less remarkable in the wake of revelations that educators and administrators, feeling pressure from their bosses to boost graduation rates and student performance, allowed many students who did not have the requisite qualifications to graduate. A city study 4 undertaken after media reports revealed the situation 4 found that more than 900 of 2,758 students who graduated from a D.C. public school last year either failed to attend enough classes or improperly took makeup classes. At one campus, Anacostia High in Southeast Washington, nearly 70 percent of the 106 graduates received 2017 diplomas despite violating some aspect of city graduation policy. _[[ A new D.C. schools scandal: Back to the future ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/29/a-new-d-c -schools-scandal-back-to-the-future/?utm_term=.d8a39176201e)]_ It was a shock for many people in the District, including **,** apparently,\\xa0Antwan Wilson, the chancellor who has been running the district for about a year and said he didn 9t know anything about the practices that sparked the scandal. But the truly shocking thing about D.C. 9s schools scandal? That it isn 9t shocking at all. It isn 9t, at least, to anybody paying attention to the past decade of school creform, which has attempted to run America 9s public education system as a business. It 9s a model that advocates say is the only way to improve public education but that critics say is unworkable and even immoral when it comes to children and a valued civic institution. Yet even after scandals erupted in district after district, and charter school after charter school, blowing holes in the cmiracle stories, reformers stuck to their talking points and their programs focused on metrics and outcomes, not inputs and collaboration. cNo excuses 4 meaning not hunger or sickness or poverty or anything else was an excuse for poor performance 4 became a motto of some charter schools when it came to student performance. And test scores became the yardstick used to measure\\xa0teachers, principals and schools. Policymakers and school reformers 4 in the District and across the nation 4 chose to believe the cmiracle narrative and ignore warning signs that were there all along. It didn 9t matter that assessment experts repeatedly said standardized test scores should not be used for high-stakes decisions and are only a narrow window into how well a student is performing. Administrators used them for big things anyway. They also insisted that every child could be assessed in some way, and in some places, officials forced even teenagers with the cognitive capacity of a 6-month-old to take standardized tests. One boy in Florida had to take one even though he was born without the cognitive part of his brain. Meanwhile, the graduation rate 4 nationally and in the District 4 continued to rise, despite scandals revealing that schools were essentially juicing the books to make it seem like they were graduating more students. Scams included phony ccredit recovery programs, failing to count all students, and, as the District just found out, letting kids graduate without the qualifications required for a diploma. Reformers refused to admit, at least publicly, that there are no cmiracles in education. Student success takes hard work by young people and their teachers and parents, and it takes work not just around school policy but also with housing and health and fiscal and transportation policy. The D.C. csuccess came out of a creform program started in 2007 by Chancellor Michelle Rhee, continued by the like-minded Kaya Henderson and further pushed along by Rhee-admirer Wilson. That program began by using test scores to evaluate students, schools and educators (and, for a time, custodians and every other adult in a school building), and included a groundbreaking performance pay system paid for by\\xa0philanthropists, the spread of charter schools and vouchers, and a chronic churn in teachers and principals that Rhee saw as healthy (even though research shows children, especially from low-income families, need stability). She was, after all, shown in 2008 on the cover of Time magazine, holding a broom, which infuriated educators who felt as if she were painting them all as ineffective. But teachers and others who expressed concern that she was rushing to implement untested reforms were (at best) ignored. They were called cdefenders of the status quo, with the status quo being a bad thing. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has made clear her disdain for the traditional public education system, uses that term now to describe her critics, along with csycophants of the system. In the District, standardized test scores 4 which are highly correlated to Zip code and family income 4 did indeed dramatically rise over the past decade. But officials didn 9t like to mention that proficiency rates of D.C. students would still be considered failing in a high-performing district or that a wide achievement gap persists between white students and\\xa0black and Hispanic students. Some in the District also say that test scores rose because the percentage of white students 4 who traditionally do better on standardized tests 4 has grown in District schools in recent years. The problems were known, but not acknowledged, by officials. In 2011, Bill Turque, then The Washington Post 9s D.C. schools reporter, wrote that Rhee 9s focus on test scores did indeed bring cbig gains 4 and more big headlines 4 for the city. He also said: > But the produce-or-else testing culture that she fostered 4 tying portions of some evaluations to growth in scores and securing commitments from principals to hit numerical targets 4 created a climate of fear, in the view of many school employees. > > It also coincided with evidence of cheating on annual city tests. A climate of fear in a school has never been known to produce much of anything useful. The graduation rate in District schools has risen steadily 4 hitting 73 percent in spring 2017 4 a 20-point gain since 2011. But even though genuine graduation gains are not easy to attain, officials never publicly questioned some of the cmiracle graduation stories in D.C. schools. In fact, Wilson 9s strategic plans calls for an 85 percent graduation rate within four years and 90 percent within five years. A\\xa0five-percentage-point increase in a year? How realistic is that? The assessment system, known as IMPACT, that was introduced by Rhee and continued by Henderson, drew serious concerns from teachers and principals, who found it unworkable and unfair, with performance goals that were impossible to meet and metrics that were questionable. But officials would not concede that it was severely flawed, choosing instead to change it repeatedly under the guise of making something good even better. The pressure that IMPACT placed on educators and administrators\\xa0 4 pressure that led to cheating on tests and phony graduation rates 4 was never acknowledged, at least until the new scandal. It is worth noting that scandals often have many layers. There may be good reasons that some students were allowed to graduate without all of the qualifications, and it may make sense to review the validity of the requirements. But it is clear that the system broke down and that officials either didn 9t know about it because people who report to them didn 9t confess 4 or they knew and didn 9t want to let the public know. How long this has been going on is unclear, but it is not likely it was just in 2017. This raises the question of what else Michelle Rhee and Kaya Henderson should have known 4 and what Antwan Wilson doesn 9t know now 4 about goings-on in the D.C. school system. Did the reforms they implemented in the name of accountability have processes that would really hold people accountable? The city report, ordered by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, highlighted deficiencies in the system around the graduation issue, including that cmost DCPS high schools exhibited a culture of passing and graduating students because of a cvariety of institutional pressures. And it raises this question, too: When are school reformers nationwide who have had a love affair with the D.C. model going to give it up? ] ",

The news media must publish newspapers and produce programs that recognize the existence and activities of Negroes as a group within the community and as a part of the larger community.  * Recruit more Negroes into journalism and broadcasting and promote those who are qualified to positions of significant responsibility. Recruitment should begin in high schools and continue through college; where necessary, aid for training should be provided. * Improve coordination with police in reporting riot news through advance planning, and cooperate with the police in the designation of police information officers, establishment of information centers, and development of mutually acceptable guidelines for riot reporting and the conduct of media personnel.  * Accelerate efforts to ensure accurate and responsible reporting of ... racial news, through adoption by all news gathering organizations of stringent internal staff guidelines.  * Cooperate in the establishment of a privately organized and funded Institute of Urban Communications to train and educate journalists in urban affairs, recruit and train more Negro journalists, develop methods for improving police-press relations, review coverage of riots and racial issues, and support continuing research in the urban field.\"  Working toward a better future **\"No American -- white or black -- can escape the consequences** of the continuing social and economic decay of our major cities.

      "article": "[ Abstinence-only sex education 4 long-championed by social conservatives 4 is reemerging as the preferred approach during the Trump administration, a political era in which there's increasing attention to the\\xa0[alleged past sexual activity of its leader](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/porn-star-stormy- daniels-sues-president-trump/2018/03/06/1ad8e60a- 21a7-11e8-a589-763893265565_story.html?utm_term=.4bcb3e0dec22). Social\\xa0conservatives at the Department of Health and Human Services say the current White House is more supportive of abstinence education than the Obama administration.  cWe definitely are seeing a shift, Kelly Marcum, a government affairs legislative assistant at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian lobbying organization, [told](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education- making-a-comeback-under-trump) the Hill. cWe 9re really excited to see that the administration is giving some tools back to us to keep pushing that fight. In addition to allocating millions of dollars to programs that encourage teens to abstain from sex,\\xa0groups seeking Title X federal family planning funds are being asked to place a cmeaningful emphasis on cthe benefits of avoiding sex in their sex education and to avoid programs that cnormalize sexual risk behaviors. But data shows that teens are having sex less and that the teen pregnancy rate has declined, arguably in part because of the more comprehensive sex education programs of the Obama era. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\xa0[reported](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm665152a1.htmF1_down)\\xa0this year that there 9s been\\xa0a decline in the share of high school students who reported having sex. The number was nearly half 4 47 percent 4 in 2005. But in 2015, it had dropped to 41 percent. Births among Hispanic and black teens have dropped by nearly half since 2006, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0428-teen-birth- rates.html) to the CDC. And the most recent [report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/teen- births/index.htm) from the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the teen birthrate in the United States is at a record low, dropping below 25 births per 1,000 teen females for the first time since the government began collecting consistent data on births to teens ages 15 to 19. Perhaps support for abstinence-only education is in part rooted in what is happening in the communities of social conservatives. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday /blue-states-red-states-values.html): > cWhen evangelical kids have sex, they 9re less likely to use birth control 4 and that may be a reason (along with lower abortion rates) that red states have high teen birthrates. > > Nine of the 10 states with the highest teen birthrates voted Republican in 2016. And nine of the 10 states with the lowest teen birthrates voted Democratic. [According to Power to Decide](https://powertodecide.org/what-we- do/information/national-state-data/teen-birth-rate), a nonprofit working to prevent unplanned pregnancy, the 10 states with the highest teen birthrates are: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, West Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee. President Trump won in all those states except New Mexico. Despite the interest in teens' sex lives from\\xa0some affiliated with socially conservative groups, others from those same organizations appear to have little concern about the sex life of the president they support. After reports that Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to\\xa0prevent her from talking about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump,\\xa0Family Research Council President Tony Perkins recently\\xa0[told](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/23/tony- perkins-evangelicals-donald-trump-stormy-daniels-216498)\\xa0Politico that evangelicals were willing to give Trump a cdo-over. _[[ Porn actress Stormy Daniels sues Trump, says hush agreement is null because he didn 9t sign it ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations /porn-star-stormy-daniels-sues-president-trump/2018/03/06/1ad8e60a- 21a7-11e8-a589-763893265565_story.html?utm_term=.4bcb3e0dec22)]_  cWe kind of gave him 4 8All right, you get a mulligan.

The socially conservative pastor, who initially declined to support GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 out of concerns about his Mormon faith, said Trump 9s personal behavior isn 9t an issue.  cEvangelicals knew they weren 9t voting for an altar boy when they voted for Donald Trump, he said.\\xa0 cWe supported him because of his policies and his strong leadership.

      "article": "[  Beijing (AP) -- The BBC&apos;s China editor has resigned her position in Beijing in protest over what she called a failure to sufficiently address a gap in compensation between men and women at the public broadcaster.  Carrie Gracie&apos;s departure is the latest aftershock from the BBC&apos;s forced publication last year of pay levels for its top earners that showed two-thirds of those in the top bracket were men.  Presenting the corporation&apos;s flagship \"Today\" program on Monday alongside John Humphrys, the BBC&apos;s highest-paid news broadcaster, Gracie said the support she&apos;d received for her decision had been \"very moving\" and showed the degree of frustration among many over the issue of equal pay.        \"I think the scale of feeling, not just among BBC women but also just more widely across the country and also internationally, the support that I&apos;ve had in the last few hours over this, I think it does speak to the depth of hunger for an equal, fair and transparent pay system,\" she said.  \"And the other thing I&apos;d like to say is that what is lovely for me is that people are mentioning my China work, because I would not wish to be remembered forever as the woman who complained about money.\"  A 30-year veteran of the BBC who speaks fluent Chinese, Gracie said in a statement on her website addressed to BBC viewers that she could no longer perform her job at a high level while battling with bosses over pay equality.  Gracie said she learned that two of the BBC&apos;s four international editors 4 both men 4 made at least 50 percent more than their two female counterparts. She said she was not seeking more money for herself, but only demanding that the BBC observe British law requiring equal pay for equal work.  Gracie said she would stay with the BBC and \"return to my former post in the TV newsroom where I expect to be paid equally.\"     \"The BBC must admit the problem, apologize and set in place an equal, fair and transparent pay structure,\" Gracie wrote.  Rather than waste money on an \"unwinnable court fight against female staff, the BBC should immediately agree to independent arbitration to settle individual cases,\" she wrote.  The BBC on Monday quoted a spokeswoman as reaffirming its commitment to equal pay and saying a separate report on pay for on-air staff would be issued in the \"not too distant future.\"  \"A significant number of organizations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing considerably better than many and are well below the national average.  \"Alongside that, we have already conducted an independent judge-led audit of pay for rank and file staff which showed &apos;no systemic discrimination against women,&apos;\" the statement said.  Gracie, who took on the newly created job of China editor four years ago, said women at the BBC were running out of \"patience and good will\" in the face of what she called a \"divide and rule\" approach and a continuing refusal by the corporation to admit to discriminatory policies. She said those who complained faced the threat of retaliation and even dismissal, while others were either bogged down in arbitration talks or offered new pay packages on condition the terms remained secret.  \"Despite the BBC&apos;s public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women&apos;s work was worth much less than men&apos;s,\" she wrote.  Gracie&apos;s move received voluble praise online from her colleagues, with veteran BBC journalist Lyse Doucet tweeting, \"Brilliant Brave.\"     Other senior women at the BBC offered support, including Clare Balding, Emily Maitlis and Sarah Montague.  The list published last year showed that two-thirds of the BBC&apos;s highest earners were men, with the highest-paid woman earning less than a quarter of the highest-earning male star. Many BBC men were also found to be receiving far higher salaries than women in comparable jobs.  ___  Associated Press writer Danica Kirka contributed to this report from London.   ] ",

Katie Brennan was suspended from the Australian Football League Women's (AFLW) over a rough tackle. A similar offence in the men's league would attract a fine, not a suspension. Brennan has taken her case to the Australian Human Rights Commission. League officials have denied sexism.  What was wrong with the tackle? Australian rules football is a contact sport that involves two teams of 18 people who use their feet or hands to move an oval-shaped ball.    Players tackle by wrapping their arms around an opponent and dragging them to the ground. Brennan's tackle was deemed illegal because her opponent's head hit the ground - a rule designed to prevent concussion. The opponent appeared shaken but continued playing.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Brennan tackles a player legally to the ground during a match in 2015  A tribunal ruled that Brennan had used excessive force, and banned her from leading the Western Bulldogs in the AFLW Grand Final on Saturday.  What is Brennan alleging? Brennan has asserted that her suspension is a \"fundamental breach\" of Australia's Sex Discrimination Act. She argues that AFL rules stipulate a lesser penalty in the men's game, citing incidents involving players Jack Redden and Ben Howlett last year.   * [The women's sport captivating Australia](/news/world-australia-39111312)   * [Transgender first for Australian football](/news/world-australia-43044082)  \"I believe my tackle on [opponent] Harriet Cordner was reasonable and I strongly disagree with the guilty finding,\" she said in a statement on Friday. \"It is even more troubling to know that if I was a man playing in the AFL and was reported for the identical tackle, I would not have been suspended and I would be playing in a grand final tomorrow.\"   Skip Twitter post by @Bekelauer  > Katie Brennan fighting the patriarchy by taking the AFL to the Australian Human Rights Commission on a gender discrimination basis.

AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said it was unfair to call Brennan's case an example of sexism. \"I guess I would say that in different competitions, we have different rules,\" he said on Melbourne radio station 3AW. However, he said the current rules would be reviewed. \"It will definitely be looked at, whether there's change is a different issue. I think there's a fair question to be asked there,\" he said. Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains said: \"We share Katie's view that her suspension was wrong and we will fully support her challenging the AFL rules on the basis of gender discrimination.\"  What happens now? Brennan will seek to overturn her suspension through the Australian Human Rights Commission - an independent statutory body that is government-funded. [The commission resolves matters through conciliation](http://www.humanrights.gov.au/complaint-information). There will be no outcome before Saturday, but Brennan said her main aim was to make rules consistent between AFL and AFLW. \"The fight for gender equality is as every bit as important to me as the grand final,\" she said.

      "article": "[  The new memoir, \"Educated,\" traces the unlikely path of a girl growing up entirely off the grid in Idaho to a woman earning her Ph.D. from Cambridge University. Author Tara Westover writes that as a child, \"We have no medical records because we were born at home, we have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom. At this moment, according to the state of Idaho and the federal government, I do not exist.\"\\xa0 Her isolated childhood was a product of\\xa0 her survivalist father's distrust of all forms of government. Westover joined \"CBS This Morning\" to discuss her transition into society and the difficulty of reconciling what your family wants for you and what you want for yourself. \"There was a lot of skepticism and fear of the federal government and that possibly because of the way we were living that they may come and force us to go to school,\" she said. ![educated-cover.jpg ](https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/21/0dfa2f51-4c7a-4589-8ea4-4ee60a157f39/resize/270x/a137f71bd5827599e6e8a2ce0e4547e9 /educated-cover.jpg) The book recalls some of her family's injuries from working in their junkyard including her being impaled and her brother's leg catching on fire. Even her father's injury, which she says was the most serious, was only treated by her mother's own home remedies. \"I mean, he was standing next to a car when it exploded and he was really badly burned. I think it proves 3 it wasn't that they didn't care about us. It's just the way his mind worked, the beliefs that he had,\" she said. \\xa0 A particularly difficult part of Westover's childhood, she says, was her parents' refusal to believe that her older brother was abusive to her. \"When I confronted my parents with that, they decided to try and convince me that I was insane and I couldn't trust my own memories and ultimately that would lead to is estrangement from my family. At first that was their choice, they ostracized me for speaking up against my brother and then eventually, it took me a lot of years, but then that was also my choice,\" she said. In a statement to CBS News, a lawyer for Westover's parents said: \"Tara was a loved daughter who was educated by her parents such that at age 16 she received a scholarship from BYU, a school that is not easy to get into. Like her two brothers that got PhDs, homeschooling was a sufficient foundation for their education.\" \"One of the reasons I wrote the book is because of the gaslighting I experienced from my parents. Their continual denial of things that were happening, like with my brother,\" she said. \"I think the tragedy here isn't that bad people do bad things. I think the tragedy is what good people do to keep secrets.\" It was another older brother who inspired her to try to go to college despite any formal education. \"He'd educated himself. He had bought the books and just taught it himself and he told me that I should try to go to college. So I bought an ACT study guide and I tried to teach myself enough math and grammar,\" she said. While she was able to get into Brigham Young University, the transition wasn't smooth. \"It was really difficult. I mean, I arrived and I didn't know what the Holocaust was,\" she said. In writing her memoir, Westover grappled with the obligations of family and the limits to those obligations. \"I felt like I needed to come to terms with the decision I'd made to let go of my family,\" she said. \"What do you do when you want to be loyal to your family but you feel that loyalty to them is in conflict somehow with loyalty to yourself.\"  ] ",

While South Korean President Moon Jae-in has invited hundreds of North Korean musicians, athletes and officials to take part in a push for peace, his critics at home are becoming more vocal. Moon 9s approval rating fell six percentage points to 67 percent\\xa0in a Gallup Korea poll last week, the largest drop since July and near his historic low of 65 percent in late September. While still higher than many other world leaders, the slip reflects unease among South Koreans who resent sharing the global stage with a renegade regime.     Moon is seeking to use the Olympics as a lever to spur negotiations on halting North Korea 9s nuclear weapons program. Kim sees his arsenal as essential to deterring an invasion by the U.S. or others.

Photographer: Kim Jae-Myeong/Donga Daily via Getty Images     At the center of the Olympics disquiet among ordinary South Koreans is Moon 9s decision to allow a unified women 9s ice hockey team to compete, potentially denying some South Korean athletes a spot. While the government in Seoul has pledged to prevent any impact on its athletes, the International Olympic Committee said on the weekend the 22-member squad must include at least three North Korean players.  Youth Vote Nearly half the respondents to a Realmeter poll last week said the Korean teams should march at the opening ceremony under separate flags, more than the 41 percent who want them to march under a single banner. Many people also oppose the government giving assistance to North Korea such as paying for the delegation 9s stay. Perhaps most worrying for the president is the fall in his support among voters in their 20s and 30s. Approval among these two age groups was as high as 94 percent in the weeks after his inauguration last May, but has now slipping to 75 percent and 82 percent, respectively.

Gallup Korea polls   ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iI_4rjepkgt0/v1/-1x-1.png)  Moon needs strong public support to push through reforms to reshape institutions and the economy. He also needs voters on his side as he pushes a two-track approach on North Korea of both pressure and engagement. Younger South Koreans are liberal in all aspects except regarding North Korea, according to Lee Jae-mook, who teaches political science at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.  cThe first image that North Korea reminds them of is past provocations or current nuclear threats, Lee said. cThe young people are also living in a world they call a hell. They 9re busy trying to feed themselves every day amid tough competition for survival and not ready to pay for North Korea for their delegation 9s stay or unification.  ] ",

They can be held by poverty, sexual and domestic violence, and social stigma. But a charity, Camfed, is working to keep girls in school, in the belief that education can be the best protection against child marriage. Camfed works in Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Ghana, and says child marriage is both a consequence of poverty and perpetuates it. \"Most child brides have lost one or both parents, and face a daily struggle for food,\" explains Angeline Murimirwa, Camfed's executive director for Africa.    \"Elderly grandparents or other family members don't have the financial means to look after them, and often find themselves pushed to consider marriage as the best option for the girl.\"  Lifting families from poverty In Africa, there are 125m child brides, with 39% of all girls in the sub- Saharan region married before the age of 18. Although many families believe child marriage provides a financial benefit, it often only exacerbates the situation.  Image copyrightCamfedImage caption If girls can get an education they can increase their earnings and invest in their families  In poor communities, any spare money is often spent on sending boys to school, as they are seen as having a higher chance of securing work, and don't face the same safety risks as girls on long journeys to school. But that means families losing the earnings that could have come from keeping girls in school. Women often reinvest their earning in their families, paying to educate their children, siblings and relatives, meaning one educated girl has the potential to lift her entire family out of poverty. But when girls are married off their education usually ends there. Many child brides hope marriage will provide the opportunity to go to school, however they typically end up falling pregnant soon after, or being kept at home to carry out household chores. In sub-Saharan Africa, 75% of girls start primary school, but only 8% finish secondary school. A report from Unicef projected the number of girl brides will double by 2050 if no action is taken.  Married at 12 Gloria - not her real name - was 12 when her father died, leaving her mother to care for 10 children alone. Living in one of the poorest provinces of rural Zambia, there were few options available for the family. \"I cried because I was too young to get married,\" Gloria recalled. \"I did not want to. I did not understand the meaning of marriage. I was so scared.\"  Image copyrightCamfedImage caption Child brides can be forced into early marriage by poverty and then lack the education to support themselves and escape  After Gloria's wedding, she stopped going to school and instead had to spend her days taking care of the house and looking for work. Six months into the marriage, Gloria became pregnant, and was forced to marry her husband's brother after her husband suddenly died. Routinely subjected to domestic violence, she miscarried. A few years later, Gloria fell pregnant again, and was still carrying the baby when her second husband died, leaving her to give birth alone. \"I had no knowledge of how to deliver a baby. I delivered at home, and the neighbour heard me. That's when they came to help me.\" Like millions of other child brides, Gloria was left trapped in the poverty cycle, having left school with no qualifications. Camfed came to Gloria's aid, after hearing of her situation through its network of former students who had been supported through education by Camfed. This alumni network, the Camfed Association, was started by Angeline Murimirwa, after she became one of Camfed's first scholars.  Struggling to pay for school \"I remember wearing a torn dress to primary school, having no shoes and not enough to eat. I felt guilty when my parents sold maize to buy me school supplies and I used to wash dishes for the teacher just to get hold of a pencil,\" said Angeline. Born in Zimbabwe, Angeline's parents couldn't afford to send her to secondary school, despite her achieving one of the best exam results in the country. \"Without money for school fees or clothing, I had no hope of going, even though my mother wanted me to.\" * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [US and England pull out of Pisa tests on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42781376)   * [UK university plans to access EU funds post-Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42690438)   * [Putting university in reach of South Africa's townships](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42572139)   * [Liberia's controversial private school experiment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Investment scheme to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)? Get in touch with sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * * Camfed selected Angeline for its first support programme in Zimbabwe in 1993, and she has since risen through the ranks to executive director. Women's average earnings increase by up to 25% for each year in secondary school, and Camfed's main focus is reaching the most marginalised girls through education. So far the charity has enabled more than two million girls to go to school, and has committed to supporting one million more to attend secondary school by 2020. The charity pays school fees, and provides books, uniforms and sanitary protection - items which often present a huge barrier for rural families, even in countries where secondary education is free.  Image copyrightCamfedImage caption Camfed supports girls to keep them in school - and their former scholars help the next generation  \"We work with communities to prioritise those with the greatest need, and these people tend to be young girls,\" says Angeline. \"They're the first to drop out of school, the first to be failed by the system, they face the perils of early marriage and early pregnancy. \"Yet educating girls has the most transformational impact. Educated mothers will educate their sons and daughters, and new pathways are opened up for women in economic independence and leadership.\" Gloria is a poster girl for how education can transform a girl's life. She is now 17 and is preparing to return to school. \"When I finish I would like to be a doctor,\" she says. \"The first doctor in my community.\"  ] ",

According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases. , The Obama-era guidance, issued in 2011 and 2014, reinforced the obligation of colleges and universities to respond to sexual assault claims and was widely hailed as strengthening protections for accusers amid increasing evidence that those institutions were skirting their responsibilities to investigate sexual misconduct. But it was widely assailed by men 9s rights and conservative civil liberties groups as heavily biased against the accused. , In an extensive policy speech announcing the new guidance, Ms. DeVos outlined what she described as a cfailed system that violated students 9 due process rights and lacked public confidence. ,  cSchools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on, Ms. DeVos said in September. cBut the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes. , Ms. DeVos issued interim guidance that raised the standard of proof for accusers to cclear and convincing evidence from a cpreponderance of evidence and allowed cases to be settled in mediation sessions between the accuser and the accused. It also dropped time frames for completing investigations. ,  cThe new policy discriminates against women and girls and makes it harder for them to learn in a safe environment, said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women 9s Law Center, which is representing the litigants in the suit. , The plaintiffs in [the suit](https://nwlc.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/01/Dkt.-1-Complaint-filed.pdf), Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice and the Victim Rights Law Center, all advise or represent people who say they were sexually assaulted. The groups are being represented by Equal Rights Advocates, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Center for Youth Law and the National Women 9s Law Center. , In the complaint, SurvJustice said that the group had not only seen ca decrease in the number of sexual violence survivors seeking its services, but also observed a trend in educational institutions not responding at all, or not responding as promptly to its clients 9 complaints. , The group also wrote of cstudents who have questioned whether they should continue with their plans to report sexual violence given the uncertainty regarding their legal protections and an anticipated lowered likelihood of success created by the policy change. , The Victims Rights Law Center, which focuses its efforts on rape and sexual assault, said Ms. DeVos 9s guidance was cdevastating to its mission and operational activities. , The groups are asking that the guidance be rescinded as unlawful. ,  cWith each day that passes, this discriminatory policy will continue to cause harm to survivors of sexual harassment and violence, said Alice Y. Abrokwa, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law. , In their complaint, the groups wrote that Ms. DeVos and her acting leader of civil rights, Candice Jackson, made statements that revealed their bias against accusers. , They cited Ms. DeVos 9s policy address during which she asserted that cif everything is harassment, then nothing is, and Ms. Jackson 9s dismissal of women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment as cfake victims. ] ",

      "article": "[ But since Trump has the ultimate authority over who he does -- and doesn't -- want in his inner circle, it's far from clear whether Kelly's new policy will be immediately enforced on Kushner, the official said. The new clearance policy could limit Kushner's ability to participate in meetings or handle documents with classified information, a strategy some say is intentional on Kelly's behalf. Kushner has taken an active role in foreign policy in the Trump administration, and has requested access to more classified information than most other top White House aides, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, the person downplayed the extent to which his biggest portfolios -- including attempting to broker a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians and working with China on trade issues -- would require access to highly classified information. Instead, the person said, those matters could be walled off without requiring access to other government secrets.

Here's a timeline](/2018/02/13/politics/rob-porter-john-kelly-timeline-white- house/index.html) Kelly's new process for granting security clearances comes a little over a week after former staff secretary Rob Porter resigned when abuse allegations against him became public. Kelly has been the subject of criticism in that time over revelations that Porter remained on staff for months in spite of the FBI flagging the allegations of domestic abuse to the White House. In his memo, Kelly acknowledged that that \"we should -- and in the future, must -- do better.\" One White House official said that, although unspoken, it was clear that other staffers were worried about raising questions about Porter's clearance issues because they were concerned it would resurrect scrutiny surrounding Kushner's own issues. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump were once proponents of Kelly, believing he would bring much-needed stability to a chaotic West Wing, neither thought the limitations he would impose would apply to them. They have, in turn, soured on him. The pair has actively discussed possible replacements for Kelly, including Gary Cohn, who is currently Trump's top economic adviser. Multiple White House officials have said the complications with Kushner's security clearance have only exacerbated his frustration with Kelly, who has privately disregarded Kushner and Ivanka Trump as unserious and meddling. Since becoming chief of staff, Kelly has sought to limit Kushner's portfolio while also dismissing Ivanka Trump's agenda, once referring to her child tax credit as \"a pet project.\" One White House official speculated that the security clearance restriction could also serve as a way for Kelly to limit Kushner's access to the President, because he would be restricted from attending certain briefings or participating in sensitive conversations. Though a source familiar with the situation said Kushner has not yet appealed to the President directly about his access to highly classified information, those close to Trump believe he would be inclined to grant his son-in-law access if asked. This source pointed to the fact that Kushner is part of the President's family and has outlasted all of his rivals in Trump's inner circle, including former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former chief strategist Steve Bannon, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former deputy campaign manager David Bossie. Trump, however, has given Kelly his full support in efforts to reform the White House's system of security clearances, and has told his chief of staff that changes need to be made to bring the system into order, according to a person who has spoken to him about the matter. Kelly has interpreted that as a wide-ranging mandate that would include Kushner, a person familiar with the matter said. The person said Trump and Kelly would likely discuss the matter this week, if they haven't already, before Kelly's self-imposed Friday deadline.

Kelly spent the weekend in Florida with the President at his estate in West Palm Beach. The President also told Kelly privately that he has his support, adding that he \"had a hell of a week\" and emerged stronger. Kelly, who has told colleagues he considers himself to be media savvy, has been cautious to appear publicly supportive of Kushner. After questions were raised whether the new clearance policy would affect Kushner, Kelly issued a statement saying he had \"full confidence in (Kushner's) ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico.\" \"Everyone in the White House is grateful for these valuable contributions to furthering the President's agenda,\" Kelly said. \"There is no truth to any suggestion otherwise.\" Kelly also coached White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on how to answer when asked about Kushner's clearance issues. \"I can tell you that nothing that has taken place will affect the valuable work that Jared is doing. He continues, and will continue, to be a valued member of the team,\" Sanders said at the briefing Tuesday. \"And he'll continue to do the important work that he's been focused on with the last year.\" ] ",

It will be run by the University of Dundee and the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI). Up to 50 places will be available on the course - aimed at graduates and people who want to change careers. The scheme is unlikely to be controversial and has been welcomed by the profession's governing body. The universities will work closely with rural schools in areas of deprivation to help deliver the 18-month course.    The new scheme will join a number of other courses which are designed to complement the main teacher training system. It was picked after a government procurement exercise to find another new route into teaching.  'Unprecedented change' Some people in the profession had been concerned in case the latest scheme would mirror Teach First south of the border which allows trainees into the classroom at an early stage. Teach First decided not to bid for this contract. The course - which will run from December 2018 to June 2020 - will be open to graduates with a minimum 2:1 honours degree in chemistry, physics, home economics, maths and engineering. The chief executive of teaching's governing body, the GTCS, Kenneth Muir said: \"This new route into teaching is a welcome addition to the range of opportunities that exist to support people to become high quality teachers. \"It offers additional flexibility while maintaining the strength and quality of input from Scottish Initial Teacher Education Universities. \"Society is changing at an unprecedented speed and the way we train and register teachers must reflect those changes. We believe this route into teaching does that and GTCS is ready to start the process of accrediting this new programme as soon as possible. \"It is important to remember, as the cabinet secretary and GTCS Council have stressed all along, any new routes into teaching must meet the high quality benchmark of the GTCS Standards for Registration in order to ensure our children and young people receive the best possible learning experiences.\"  'Extremely rewarding' The course will complement 11 other alterative routes into teaching for Scots who do not want to do a traditional postgraduate course in education followed by a probationary year. The two universities will work with schools in Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, the Borders and the Highlands. Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary, John Swinney, said: \"Teachers are the foundation of Scotland's education system and are crucial to our aspiration of closing the poverty-related attainment gap. \"We know that some areas face challenges in recruiting teachers in certain subject areas and this means that we need to think differently about how we attract new recruits into the classroom. \"This innovative proposal is designed to broaden the range of people entering the profession - providing a challenging, yet extremely rewarding, opportunity to train in rural schools within areas of high deprivation. \"Crucially, this route maintains the traditionally high standard of teaching in Scotland and I am pleased to support it with a quarter of million pounds from the Attainment Scotland Fund.\" Supporters of the scheme will be hoping it helps attract more Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) graduates into teaching and eventually helps deal with the recruitment difficulties experienced in some areas.  ] ",

      "article": "[  Discrimination in auto buying is alive and well more than 40 years after the Equal Credit Opportunity Act outlawed discrimination in lending.\\xa0 The National Fair Housing Alliance said it sent eight pairs of car buyers -- one white, one not -- to shop separately at car dealerships in Virginia. Despite the fact that all the nonwhite test buyers were better qualified for loans, 62.5 percent received more costly pricing, which would have caused them to pay an average of $2,662.56 more.\\xa0 Three-quarters of the time, white buyers also were given more financing options than buyers of color, according to NFHA's report, released Thursday.\\xa0 \"It is upsetting to find that in 2018, consumers of color are still facing discriminatory practices when making major financial purchases,\" said Lindsay Daniels, associate director of economic policy for UnidosUS in a prepared statement. \"Being charged more for credit despite being financially qualified for better rates, especially on big-ticket items like a car, can have devastating impact on a family's monthly budget and financial stability.\"\\xa0    The report was more a confirmation of earlier studies than a revelation about discrimination in lending. Discriminatory practices have been chronicled frequently since the 1990s, when a Yale law professor came up with the idea of sending identically situated testers of different races car dealerships to see how race factored into eligibility for loans. Since then, dozens of studies have been conducted with the same results.\\xa0 However, advocates said some progress was being made, thanks to a crackdown by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that started in 2013. The consumer watchdog, which won settlements from both [Honda](https://www.cbsnews.com/news /honda-to-pay-alleged-victims-of-discriminatory-loans/) and [Toyota's](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/02/02/toyota-discrimination- settlement/)\\xa0financing arms two years ago, is now under new leadership, and pending legislation would restrict the agency's ability to penalize violators.\\xa0 \"This study points to the need for having a watchdog on the beat that is empowered to do their job,\" said Delvin Davis, senior researcher for the National Fair Housing Alliance. With the CFPB's continued commitment to fair lending unclear, car buyers would be wise to protect themselves. Fortunately, new and improved tools put consumers in the driver's seat, providing more pricing transparency and negotiating power. What should you do if you're in the car market, regardless of your race?  **Know your credit score** The best financing terms go to buyers who have high credit scores. Generally speaking, a score of 720-740 (depending on the scoring system) should win you the best rates on auto loans.\\xa0 Consumers can get free credit scores in a number of ways. Many credit card companies, including Capital One ([COF](http://markets.cbsnews.com/COF/quote/)), Chase ([JPM](http://markets.cbsnews.com/JPM/quote/)), Citi ([C](http://markets.cbsnews.com/C/quote/)) and American Express ([AXP](http://markets.cbsnews.com/AXP/quote/)), will provide free credit scores to their card holders. Discover ([DFS](http://markets.cbsnews.com/gm/quote/)) will [provide a free credit score](https://www.discover.com/free-credit-score/) to anyone who asks. Website [CreditKarma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) also provides free scores and advice on what might be holding your score back.  **Get pre-approved** Before you walk into a dealership, check with your own bank or credit union and get pre-approved for an auto loan, suggested Jack Gilles, director of public affairs for the Consumer Federation of America and author of \"The Car Book.\" The car dealer, which may have access to subsidized rates from the manufacturer, could still beat that rate.\\xa0 However, if the dealer can't or won't give you a better deal, a pre-approval means you don't need to accept higher-cost financing.  **Check prices online and negotiate via phone** Websites, including KBB.com and Edmunds.com, can give you a good read on what a car should cost loaded with all of the extras that you want. These services will also link to specific car offers, including the list prices at various dealerships.\\xa0 This can be a good starting point to shop online and over the phone, calling -- or emailing -- the relevant dealerships to begin your negotiating process. Be sure to ask about the all-in price, including taxes, destination fees and any other mandatory dealer add-ons. Email multiple dealers, asking for their best price on what you want. When dealers know they're competing, you often get better prices.\\xa0  **Get the VIN** Particularly if you're buying a used car -- each of which is unique because of wear and tear, options and mileage -- make sure you get the VIN (vehicle ID number) for any car you've negotiated down to a price that you find appealing. This can reduce the chance that the dealer will claim your specific car \"just sold,\" giving the dealer the ability to restart the negotiating process in person.\\xa0  **Consider a car-buying service** If you're a Costco ([COST](http://markets.cbsnews.com/COST/quote/)) member, the club offers a free car-buying service, where the prices have been pre- negotiated at a discount to manufacturer's suggested retail. For a $250 fee, CarBargains.org will also negotiate with five dealers for you.\\xa0 However, you may be able to do even better by using these services and then expanding the list of dealerships that you price-check via email, using the pre-negotiated prices as your starting point and only buying when you get an even better deal.\\xa0  **Walk** If you have good credit, you have bargaining power. The best way to exercise it is to walk away when you feel the dealership is being dishonest or disrespectful. When finalizing your deal, be sure to read the financing documents and make sure they conform with the deal you negotiated. There are thousands of car dealers. Take your time and find one that treats you fairly and doesn't throw in unexpected costs when you're about ready to sign on the dotted line.  ] ",

What are your most important tools for doing your job?** , We 9re living in [a surveillance economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/technology/obamas-effort-on- consumer-privacy-falls-short-critics-say.html \"Times' story on the topic.\") where sites and apps can track and categorize our every online move. In that ecosystem, encrypted communication services have become some of my most important reporting tools. , For people who would rather not reach me through my corporate Gmail account at The Times, I use ProtonMail, an encrypted email service. I also use Signal, an encrypted text messaging and calling service. And I do some online research through Tor, a browser that masks your online address so sites can 9t track your physical location. I also use DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn 9t store your search history. , My wariness of tracking developed when I was a cub reporter in Moscow. On one of my first stories there, I invited a Russian legislator, who was a democracy advocate, to lunch at a restaurant near the Kremlin. She arrived and immediately started combing through a vase of flowers on the table, checking for government listening devices. After that, I often interviewed Russian democracy activists during walks in local parks and forests. , It made an impression on me that even the mere idea of being surveilled can chill people 9s behavior. , Now I view privacy not so much as the ability to keep your personal details away from prying government agencies or companies. Privacy is the right to choose which entities access information about you, control how those entities use your data, check the fairness of data-based decisions made about you, and correct errors. , Since [American consumers currently lack those kinds of rights](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/technology/consumer-data-protection- laws-an-ocean-apart.html \"Times' story on the topic.\") over most of their data, I 9ve grown fond of tools that lift the hood on online tracking and profiling. , One tool I use on my laptop is Disconnect, a service that shows you the third parties tracking you on every site. When I was reading articles this morning about the Trump administration, Disconnect counted 78 advertising networks, analytics services and others tracking me on HuffPost; 24 trackers on The New York Times site, and 19 on The Washington Post. , **What could be better about some of these tools?** , ProtonMail can be cumbersome. The service encrypts your emails before they reach the ProtonMail server. As a result, you can 9t search the texts of your emails for keywords if you use the free service. You can search only the subject lines. , It 9s a constant reminder that ceding to online surveillance is much more frictionless than trying to limit it. , **Recently[Apple investors raised concerns about smartphone addiction](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/technology/apple-tech-children- jana-calstrs.html) and children. Is this a problem and are there adequate solutions?** , I 9ve heard from many parents, including a few physicians, concerned about the amount of time their kids are [spending online at school](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/healthy-tech-use-educators- rethink-technology-classroom/) and at home. It 9s so difficult to find the right balance between making sure our children are fluent with online tools and protecting them from getting sucked in by habit-forming video platforms and social networks. Many parents feel they are up against a powerful, interlocking ecosystem, designed to hook their kids on constant scrolling, watching, and clicking. , Given the vast ecosystem, however, singling out Apple as the culprit seems to me a little bit like blaming only soda can manufacturers for Americans 9 addiction to sugary beverages. Yes, it would be terrific [if Apple introduced new control options](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple- addiction-iphone.html) for parents. But if shareholders want to fault companies for manipulating or addicting users, they should also be taking a hard look at Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Netflix and many more. , Even small user-interface changes could make a big difference. Imagine if the default setting for streaming video services wasn 9t autoplay. , On a larger level, we 9ve seen over the past year how some Big Tech companies initially refused to take responsibility for the spread of fake news and other side effects of their innovations. In that context, platforms that nudge children and adults to stay online are merely one symptom of a much bigger problem. , **You wrote a series last year examining[tech industry influence](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/silicon-valley- baltimore-schools.html \"Times' article on the topic.\") in American public schools.

What are the similarities and differences?**  , There 9s huge hype around the idea that tech can improve education. Same goes for health. , So far, however, there 9s not much rigorous evidence that learning apps on their own improve students 9 educational results. Likewise, there is little hard evidence that health apps by themselves reduce disease. , Still, I 9m optimistic about the potential for software in health. , That 9s partly because a few tech companies are participating in rigorous studies, called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers randomly select some volunteers to try a new intervention. By comparing the results in the treated and untreated groups, researchers could identify apps that do make significant health contributions. , **Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life?** , Every weekend, I try out a new recipe from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/ \"NYT Cooking.\"). And while I 9m cooking, I listen to podcasts. , I 9m currently devouring [Uncivil, a history podcast](http://uncivil.show/ \"The show.\") on the Civil War. It unfolds like a detective story. And while you 9re engrossed in the plot twists, it neatly obliterates the standard American narrative of the Civil War. , Right now, my family is on a bit of a Brit TV binge. We just watched the second season of cThe Crown, the fictional series on Queen Elizabeth II, and cThe Coronation, a glowing documentary featuring the real QE2. And we raced through cPrime Suspect: Tennison, the prequel to the classic TV police procedural that starred Helen Mirren. , I also just took an audio boot camp course at Columbia University School of Journalism. Now I 9m teaching myself to use [Hindenburg, a radio editing program](https://hindenburg.com/products/hindenburg-journalist-pro \"Hindeburg.\"). , **Are you doing anything unusual to limit the spread of your data?** , It may seem quaint, but I still relish the idea that people in a democratic society have the right to be anonymous in public.

In simple terms, face recognition software works by scanning a photo of your face and then converting your facial topography into a unique code, called a face print. The benefit 4 [as well as the hazard](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/creepshield- claims-to-out-the-creeps-in-online-dating \"Times' story on the topic.\") 4 is that a company that takes a face print from one photo of you could potentially use it to identify you in any other photo or video frame. , I may be particularly attuned to the fragility of public anonymity because, like many journalists, [I 9ve been doxed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/technology/just-the-facts-this- dossier-goes-further.html \"Times' article on the subject.\"). , So, as an experiment, I 9ve been limiting photos of myself online to see whether I have any control over how they spread.

They also serve as nurses, psychologists, counselors, parents, coaches and dietitians 4 and that complicates not only how they do their jobs but also efforts to evaluate their performance in the classroom. For years now, teachers have been evaluated in part\\xa0 4 sometimes in large part 4\\xa0 by students 9 standardized test scores, despite assessment experts warning against using scores for such high stakes because they are not valid for that purpose. In this post, teacher Justin Parmenter explains why it 9s a bad idea and how multifaceted the role teachers play really is. Parmenter has been an educator for more than two decades. He\\xa0[once wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/08/11/are- teachers-professionals/?utm_term=.79354efefd46) that he started his teaching career cbelieving that I was going to transform every child, just like many first-year teachers believe when they are placed in schools with a high-needs population, but he soon realized he was cin for a rude awakening. His first teaching job was at a school on the White Mountain Apache Reservation in the poorest county in Arizona, where young people face extraordinary challenges. Parmenter said that with support from colleagues, he learned what it really takes to help at-risk children do well at school. He now teaches seventh-grade language arts at Waddell Language Academy in Charlotte and is a fellow with Hope Street Group 9s North Carolina Teacher Voice Network. He started his career as a Peace Corps volunteer in Albania and taught in Istanbul. He was a finalist for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Teacher of the Year in 2016, and you can [find him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinparmenter): @JustinParmenter [This appeared ](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op- ed/article192569904.htmlstorylink=cpy)in the Charlotte Observer, and I was given permission to republish it. _[[ You think you know what teachers do. Right? Wrong. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/02/22/you-think- you-know-what-teachers-do-right-wrong/?utm_term=.328d273c2a10)]_ By Justin Parmenter Recently, before class started, I noticed one of my seventh-grade students sitting silently at her desk with tears rolling down her cheeks. When I asked her what was the matter, she told me that her cat had a tumor, and today was his last day. I did my best to comfort her by talking with her about pets I 9d had that had been like family to me. I offered to let her go for a walk in the halls to clear her mind and went out of my way to treat her with kindness and empathy for the rest of the day. She had more pressing matters on her mind than grammar. I wondered how many other ways that scenario was playing out in other places at exactly the same time 4 a teacher stepping seamlessly out of the role of content instructor and into the role of counselor, coach or parent. How many teachers were comforting a child struggling with loss, counseling an angry student bent on revenge, or working to develop confidence in a child who needed it? How much value were those teachers adding to the lives of the children they were helping? Common sense tells us there is no way of measuring the occurrence of those scenarios or of quantifying that value. Switching hats is something that most teachers don 9t even notice themselves doing. It comes with the territory that for eight to 10 hours a day, educators are constantly identifying needs of all types and devising creative ways of meeting them. Those interactions are what make being a teacher so meaningful and remind us of the tremendous impact we 9re having on the lives of others. Just because it 9s common sense that the value of a teacher who doubles as nurse, counselor, coach and parent can 9t be precisely determined doesn 9t mean that some won 9t try to do so. We 9re seeing a resurgence of the idea that the worth of educators can be quantified, this time with principals as the target. With intense lobbying from pro-business education reform organization Best NC, the General Assembly recently passed a new statewide principal pay plan billed as rewarding cexceptional school leadership, which compensates principals in part based on student test results. While many will see pay increases, members of the state board of education say the plan will reduce some principals 9 salaries by up to 30 percent unless it is overhauled. It will also discourage principals from working at high- poverty schools where lagging test scores might lower their pay. At the classroom level, pressure to raise scores will lead to more teaching for standardized test mastery, reducing opportunities to hone the creativity, collaboration and critical thinking skills so essential to success in the modern workplace. These consequences of performance pay do not make our schools better. There is a lot of uncertainty about where education is headed in North Carolina. We have a new state superintendent without a track record in education. We have a legislature that has stripped decision-making power from the state board and governor. As we chart the course forward, we need to remember that our work as educators is a complex human endeavor, not business transactions. It is simply not possible to measure all the important ways educators touch the lives of the people they serve. _[[ Are teachers professionals? ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/08/11/are-teachers-professionals/?utm_term=.79354efefd46)]_ ] ",

      "article": "[ Can you predict a crime? , More than a half-century ago, the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick imagined a world in which a cprecrime agency made that possible. Today, a few tools promise to help nudge society in that direction. , But a new study out this week suggests that at least one such forecasting algorithm, used in some American courts, is no better than untrained humans. , In the study, [published in Science Advances](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao5580) on Wednesday, two researchers found that small groups of randomly chosen people could predict whether a criminal defendant would be convicted of a future crime with about 67 percent accuracy, a rate virtually identical to Compas, software some American judges use to inform their decisions. ,  cAn algorithm 9s accuracy can 9t be taken for granted, and we need to test these tools to ensure that they are performing as we expect them to, said Julia Dressel, who conducted the study for her Dartmouth College undergraduate thesis with Hany Farid, a computer science professor there. , Ms. Dressel and Mr. Farid also found that they could make similarly accurate predictions with just two pieces of information: a defendant 9s age and past convictions. Meanwhile, Compas, which stands for Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions, relies on six variables for assessing risk, according to Equivant, which sells the software. , The authors are far from the first to raise questions about Compas 9s role in judicial decision making. , In one high-profile case, a Wisconsin man charged with evading the police [said that](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/us/backlash-in-wisconsin- against-using-data-to-foretell-defendants-futures.html) his due process rights were violated when a judge used Compas in sentencing him to six years in prison. (He appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court, but it declined to weigh in last year.) , And, in 2016, the investigative journalism nonprofit ProPublica [concluded that](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in- criminal-sentencing) the software was unfair to black defendants. , While some academics disputed the certainty of that finding 4 arguing that it depends [on how fairness is measured](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/17/can- an-algorithm-be-racist-our-analysis-is-more-cautious-than- propublicas/?utm_term=.fea29f6fdbfa) 4 the report inspired Ms. Dressel and Mr. Farid to conduct their own study. , In addition to their main finding, the authors also found evidence of racial bias from both Compas and the humans, even though neither considered race in the predictions. Compared with their white peers, a larger share of black defendants was falsely predicted to reoffend, while a smaller share was falsely predicted not to. , Equivant disputed the findings. In [a statement](http://www.equivant.com/blog /official-response-to-science-advances) on Wednesday, it said that the authors overstated the number of variables Compas uses to predict future crimes 4 it is six, the company said, not the 137 that the authors cited. Equivant also said that the conclusions were limited by the small data sample used, the same data behind the ProPublica report. , Ms. Dressel and Mr. Farid based their analysis on a database of more than 7,000 pretrial defendants in Broward County, Fla., from 2013 to 2014. For each, the database included demographic information, criminal history, Compas risk scores and arrest records for the two years following the scoring. , A subset of 1,000 defendants was then used to collect predictions from 400 people, recruited through Amazon 9s Mechanical Turk, a marketplace for online labor. Those participants were presented with paragraphs about each of 50 defendants and asked to rate the likelihood that each would commit a crime in the following two years. , The descriptions the individuals were presented with included the defendants 9 sex, age, crime they were charged with, the type of crime and their arrest history. ] ",

      "article": "[  Lizette Menendez, 37, doesn't seem like the type of person to sue the federal government. The single mother of three dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and never went back. She's now unemployed and caring for a disabled child. But Menendez maintains she was defrauded by a now defunct cosmetology school 4 Marinello School of Beauty. She attended the school five years ago hoping to improve her lot in life. Now, her attorneys say that the U.S. Department of Education is violating the Higher Education Act 4 and its own proposed rules 4 by failing to dismiss the near $10,000 in federal student loans she ran up in a program that the DOE itself declared a sham.\\xa0 \"It is outrageous that the Education Department\\u2026 has refused to comply with the law and grant loan discharges to harmed students,\" said **** Robyn Smith, senior attorney at the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. \"These students, pawns in Marinello's fraudulent scheme to increase its revenues, should not have to repay these loans.\"    Menendez is among thousands 4 perhaps hundreds of thousands 4 of former students who could potentially have their federal student loans discharged under school fraud provisions in the Higher Education Act. However, many of these loan discharges have been put on hold while government officials dicker over whether to change the rules. \"There are a lot of people who are eligible for relief. They just don't know it,\" Smith said. The Department of Education's student aid website lists 10 different ways that all or a portion of a student's loan obligations can be wiped away. For instance, people who go into teaching or public service can have some of their loans wiped away. So, too, can graduates who later find themselves permanently disabled.\\xa0 However, a significant segment of the discharge options involve students who were defrauded. These discharge programs are now in limbo because Education Secretary Betsy DeVos decided to temporarily \"suspend\" implementation of standardized discharge rules that were supposed to go into effect last summer. It's now unclear when, or if, they will go into effect.\\xa0 The Menendez suit was filed on her behalf by two nonprofit advocacy group 4 the National Consumer Law Center and Legal Aid of Los Angeles. The litigation is aimed at pressing the Education Department for action not just for Menendez, but also for thousands of other students who find themselves saddled with crushing debt for worthless degree programs.\\xa0 \"The Higher Education Act provides critical protections for students lured to illegitimate institutions by deceptive practices and false promises,\" said Joanna Darcus, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. \"The Department of Education's ill-conceived denial of the plaintiffs' discharge applications is part of an alarming trend of letting institutional bad actors off the hook, while penalizing students with unaffordable loans and the threat of debt collection.\"\\xa0 A spokesman for the Department of Education refused to comment on the pending litigation and failed to respond to questions about the status of the suspended rules.\\xa0 Menendez filed for student loan relief under the Higher Education Act's \"false certification\" clause. This essentially says that students shouldn't be left on the hook for loans that were taken out illegally 4 either without your permission or in violation of the Department of Education's rules.\\xa0 Menendez claims in her suit that she was not eligible for federal student aid because the high school diploma that Marinello supposedly secured on her behalf was from an unaccredited program and was not a valid degree. Loans can also be discharged if a school closed before students had a chance to complete their course of study and for school misconduct.\\xa0 These loan discharge rules were put in place in the late 1990s after a government investigation found pervasive predatory practices among for-profit colleges. However, claims for loan forgiveness were rare until the Department of Education started pulling aid authorization for a number of the schools, many of which quickly folded.\\xa0 The DOE previously said that if closed school discharges had been automatic between 2014 and 2016, it would have cost the government $381 million. Yet less than half of the students who attend failed colleges know to apply for relief, Menendez' attorneys said. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 students have applied for \"borrower defense\" 4 a form of debt discharge in use since 2014 based on school misrepresentations and misconduct, according to The Century Foundation. The think tank obtained these statistics by filing a Freedom of Information Act to force the government to disclose these discharge requests. Like Menendez, 98.6 percent of the former students who applied for loan discharges attended for- profit schools, according to TCF's analysis of the government data. \\xa0    Now, however, applications for these fraud-based loan discharges have gone into limbo. That leaves students like Menendez scrambling to find ways to defer payment on their loans, or sign up for income-contingent repayment plans that require them to continuously prove that they can't afford to pay. \"This delay is harming our clients,\" said Josephine Lee, an attorney with Legal Aid in Los Angeles. \"We believe that the statute says that these students should have been approved for loan discharges.\" The Menendez suit seeks an immediate approval of her discharge application, as well as the applications of two other named Marinello graduates, whose situations mirrored her own. In addition, her suit asks the court to compel the Department of Education to implement its borrower discharge regulations and continue providing relief to defrauded students.  ] ",

(Dominick Reuter/AFP/GettyImages) The U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent for a third straight month 4 the lowest level since 2000, according to the Labor Department 4 but\\xa0black Americans\\xa0didn't fare as well as others. The unemployment rate for African Americans was 6.8 percent in December. The black unemployment rate has historically been higher than the national average -- and sometimes more than double the unemployment rate for white Americans. Still, the December number was a record low, something President Trump noted Saturday. > The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8%, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And, in the Washington Post (of all places), headline states, cTrumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good. > > 4 Donald J.

Gallup's latest data has just 6 percent of black Americans approving of the president's job performance. _[[ U.S. added 148,000 jobs in December, a lagging finish to year of strong growth ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/05/u-s-added-200000 -jobs-in-december-capping-year-of-strong-growth-economists- predict/?utm_term=.433317642330)]_ Trump campaigned as a job creator and promised to improve the economy for all Americans 4 blacks included.  cYou're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, **\\xa0** 58 percent of your youth is unemployed 4 what the hell do you have to lose? d\\xa0he asked before\\xa0a\\xa0crowd\\xa0in Dimondale, Mich., during the campaign, a city that is more than 92 percent white. Black voters were overwhelmingly unconvinced, and Trump lost the African American vote to Hillary Clinton. But since Trump entered the Oval Office, his surrogates have claimed he has fulfilled his promise to black Americans. Stephen Moore,\\xa0an economic adviser to Trump 9s 2016 presidential campaign, [wrote](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the- administration/346647-opinion-the-real-record-on-black-america-under-trump-vs) in the Hill: > Preliminary data show black wages and incomes up since the election. It 9s early for sure, but so far Trump has done more for black economic progress in six months than Obama did in eight years. . . . So is Trump a racist who doesn 9t care about the future of black Americans? He is creating jobs, higher incomes and trying to give a better education to every disadvantaged child in America. That is a pretty darn good civil rights record. However,\\xa0there's a good chance that this low\\xa0number that Moore and company praise isn't likely to continue at this rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics [shows](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000006?include_graphs=false&output_type=column&years_option=all_years) that the black unemployment rate fluctuates from month to month. Economist Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/05/good- news-from-todays-jobs-report-the-tight-labor-market-is-helping-to-reduce-the- racial-unemployment-gap/?utm_term=.b75e7c29fa51) in the Post: \"We shouldn 9t get too excited about that relatively low monthly rate 4 given the high statistical variance in these data, it could jump back up next month.\" Voters interviewed by The Fix after the jobs report's release wanted Trump to address the issues that have caused the black unemployment rate to remain higher than the total jobless population. While Trump was quick to take credit for the drop in black unemployment, his White House has yet to explain what actions he specifically took that led to the change. This led some to conclude that Trump is exaggerating the role his administration played in the drop. Employment [trends](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000006?include_graphs=false&output_type=column&years_option=all_years) show that the black unemployment rate often decreases in December when seasonal hiring increases in the retail industry, which [employs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/02/retail-work- can-be-difficult-for-almost-everyone-but-heres-why-its-even-worse-for-blacks- and-latinos/?utm_term=.9a0df1088f8e) a disproportionately higher number of people of color. And others including Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden, suggested that the drop was not likely due to actions from the Trump White House, but a continuation of the economic policies implemented by the Obama Administration: \"Rigorous\\xa0[research](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017071pap.pdf)\\xa0by Federal Reserve economists shows that black unemployment, along with the black/white gap is highly cyclical, meaning that what we 9re seeing here is what we 9d expect in year nine of an economic expansion with a labor market closing in on full employment.\" > Under Obama, Black unemployment fell from 16.5% to 7.9% in his final days in office.

      "article": "[  Gay workers and their corporate supporters won a legal victory over the Trump administration as a federal appeals court ruled that firing people over their sexual orientation is a form of illegal sex discrimination. The appeals court in Manhattan overturned its own previous rulings, saying clegal doctrine evolves. It 9s the second ruling in the U.S. to break with precedent in finding that workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal. A third appeals court ruled the other way last year. The split among the courts sets up a possible Supreme Court showdown. \"Sexual orientation discrimination -- which is motivated by an employer 9s opposition to romantic association between particular sexes -- is discrimination based on the employee 9s own sex,\" Judge Robert Katzmann wrote in an opinion for the full court 9s majority on Monday. ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPMNsEZNiiRs/v1/60x-1.jpg)](https://www.bloomberg.com/features /trump-daily/) [Follow the Trump Administration 9s Every Move](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/trump-daily/)     Skydiving instructor Donald Zarda claimed he was fired by Altitude Express Inc. because he was gay. He argued that Title VII of the\\xa0Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion also includes sexual orientation. Zarda, who sued in 2010, died in a base-jumping accident in Switzerland in 2014. His estate and relatives carried on with the case. \"I think this would have meant the world to him. I think he would have been very excited and very encouraged,\" said Melissa Zarda, Donald 9s sister. cI feel strongly that in the workplace employees should be evaluated based on their job performance and by their work ethic and never by who they love. [Trump Administration Says Bias Law Can 9t Protect Gay Workers](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-09-26/trump- administration-says-workplace-bias-rules-don-t-cover-gays \"Click for full story\")     Zarda wasn 9t fired for being gay, and his employer knew he was gay when he was hired, Saul Zabell, the lead attorney representing Altitude Express, said after the ruling was handed down. He said the company agreed Title VII should be amended to include sexual orientation.  cIt exceeds the judicial mandate to re-interpret Title VII to say that, although for the last 30 years Title VII has not covered sexual orientation, now it does, Zabell said. cShame on Congress for not being able to get it together to change Title VII.     A panel of three appeals court judges ruled against Zarda in April. He was granted a [rehearing](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-09-26 /trump-administration-says-workplace-bias-rules-don-t-cover-gays \"Trump Administration Says Bias Law Can\\ 9t Protect Gay Workers \\(1\\)\") before the full appeals court, which has authority over federal courts in New York, Connecticut and Vermont. In the majority opinion, Katzmann said sexual- orientation stereotyping falls within Title VII 9s prohibition against discrimination cbecause sex is necessarily a factor in sexual orientation. Ten judges agreed on the result of the case, although five disagreed with the majority 9s reasoning. Three dissented from the outcome.  Trump Administration \"This is a long due victory for equality.\" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer rights. The Trump administration argued in support of the skydiving company, based on New York 9s Long Island. The U.S. said\\xa0courts must take legislative intent into consideration, and that Congress didn 9t have the LGBT community in mind when it crafted the law. A group of 50 companies and organizations -- including [Microsoft Corp.](/quote/MSFT:US \"Company Overview\"), [Alphabet Inc.](/quote/GOOGL:US \"Company Overview\") 9s Google and [Viacom Inc.](/quote/VIAB:US \"Company Overview\") \\-- [filed documents](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/morgan-stanley- microsoft-cbs-back-legal-shield-for-gay-workers \"Google, CBS, Viacom Back Legal Shield for Gay Workers \\(1\\)\") in June arguing discrimination based on sexual orientation should be illegal.     The government 9s decision to oppose a gay worker has been cited by Trump 9s critics as evidence that he 9s pandering to religious conservatives. The president 9s supporters say the courts need to be reined in and shouldn 9t be extending rights that only Congress can establish. The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals, Devin O 9Malley, a department spokesman, said in an emailed statement.  cWe remain committed to the fundamental principle that the courts cannot expand the law beyond what Congress provided, O 9Malley said. cThe position that the department advocated in this case has been its longstanding position across administrations and remains the law of nine different Courts of Appeals. [QuickTake: Transgender Rights](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/quicktake /transgender-rights \"How To Understand the Debate Over Transgender Rights: QuickTake\") Congress for years has declined to pass legislation explicitly banning anti- gay discrimination in the workplace and most states don 9t have such laws. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former U.S. senator from Alabama, was one of the lawmakers who sought to block such legislation. He also voted to ban same- sex marriage nationwide and sought to bar LGBT Americans from the military. Title VII has been broadened by the courts over the years. The Supreme Court in 1986 ruled that the law, previously limited to \"tangible economic discrimination,\" also prohibited sexual harassment. A few years later, the high court determined the law barred discrimination in the workplace based on gender stereotypes, in a suit brought by a woman who claimed she 9d been denied partnership at an accounting firm because her clothing and appearance didn 9t conform to sex stereotypes.\\xa0 But that 9s where the courts drew the line. In 2000, a federal appeals court ruled that the addition of protection for gender stereotypes couldn 9t be used to \"bootstrap\" protection based on sexual orientation. A handful of gays and lesbians have filed suits in recent years, with mixed success. In 2015 the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said a claim of bias based on sexual orientation can be brought under Title VII. In March 2017, the appeals court in Atlanta ruled against a lesbian who was fired from a hospital, and the Supreme Court declined the hear the case. A month later, the appeals court in Chicago ruled in favor of a lesbian who was fired by a Christian college. In his dissent on Monday, U.S. Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch said he 9d cbe delighted to awake one morning and learn that Congress had just passed legislation adding sexual orientation to the list of grounds of employment discrimination prohibited under the law. But Congress, he added, has so far done cno such thing. The case is Zarda v. Altitude Express, 15-3775, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  ] ",

Spanish women were staging dozens of protests across the country against the wage gap and gender violence. In Madrid, a massive demonstration was planned for the evening. In Barcelona, protesters who disrupted traffic into the city center were pushed back by riot police. In some countries, protests were more muted, however. International Women's Day is a public holiday in Russia, but opposition presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak was one of the few demonstrators in Moscow. In a protest reminiscent of the [MeToo movement](https://www.cbsnews.com/news /california-legislature-struggles-with-metoo-movement/) \\-- which aims to hold those involved in sexual misconduct and those who cover it up accountable -- Sobchak staged a solo picket outside the lower house of the Russian parliament to demand the resignation of a prominent lawmaker whom several female journalists accuse of sexual harassment. On a lighter note, a leading French newspaper found a witty way of making its point about discrimination and the gender pay gap -- by upping its price for men. The left-leaning daily Liberation said that for one day only, men would pay 50 euro cents more than women, in a reflection of the 25 percent less that women in France are paid, on average. Across Asia, women came out to mark the day. In China, students at Tsinghua University used the day to make light of a proposed constitutional amendment to scrap term limits for the country's president. One banner joked that a boyfriend's term should also have no limits, while another said, \"A country cannot exist without a constitution, as we cannot exist without you!\" But photos of the students' banners, like other content about the proposed amendment, were quickly censored on social media. [![Rallies mark International Women's Day 2018 ](https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/08/2d1cca2b-4e3a-4838-ac4e- dca04e98986a/thumbnail/620x350/d121ec1c4c997f85fd637faee8ba5d74/ap-18067533977285.jpg)48Photos  Rallies mark International Women's Day 2018   Demonstrators around the world raise their voices for gender equality, and to protest violence against women ](/pictures/rallies-mark-international-womens-day-2018) Hundreds of activists in pink and purple shirts protested in downtown Manila against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, calling him among the worst violators of women's rights in Asia. Protest leaders sang and danced in a boisterous rally in Plaza Miranda, handing red and white roses to mothers, sisters and widows of drug suspects slain under Duterte's brutal crackdown on illegal drugs. Human rights groups have condemned Duterte's sexist remarks, including one in which he asked troops to shoot female communist rebels in the genitals. Protest leader Jean Enriquez also railed against Duterte's anti-women remarks, saying: \"We're so alarmed. We have seen his direct attacks on women under his iron-hand rule and it's now time to heighten our resistance.\"\\xa0 In Afghanistan, hundreds of women who would have been afraid to leave their homes during Taliban rule gathered in the capital to commemorate the day -- and to remind their leaders that plenty of work remains to be done to give Afghan women a voice, ensure their education and protect them from increasing violence. Hundreds of South Koreans, many wearing black and holding black MeToo signs, rallied in central Seoul. South Korea's MeToo movement has gained significant traction since January, when a female prosecutor began speaking openly about workplace mistreatment and sexual misconduct. The list of women who speak out is growing day by day. Several high-profile South Korean men have resigned from positions of power, including a governor who was a leading presidential contender before he was accused of repeatedly raping his female secretary. In India, hundreds of women -- including students, teachers and sex workers -- marched through the capital to bring attention to domestic violence, sexual attacks and discrimination in jobs and wages. \"Unite against violence against women,\" one placard urged. \"Man enough to say no to domestic abuse,\" said another. \"My body, My choice.\" India had its first female leader in 1966 when Indira Gandhi became prime minister, but Indian women are still often relegated to second-class citizenship. In Africa, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni urged men to stop physically abusing their wives. Domestic violence is common in Uganda, although victims rarely report perpetrators to the police for fear of being stigmatized or thrown out of their homes. \"If you want to fight, why don't you look for a fellow man and fight,\" Museveni asked, calling domestic abusers cowards. Back in Europe, the European Commission said in a statement published on Twitter that the continent \"is one of the safest and most equal places for women in the world.\" On the other hand, it noted that \"the path to full equality in practice is still a long one.\" \"The issue of gender equality is high on the agenda,\" Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's first vice-president, said, \"but progress is still slow on the ground.\"\\xa0 At the U.N. General Assembly, International Women's Day observances kicked off with optimism about the future, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports.\\xa0 \"The activism and advocacy of generations of women has borne fruit,\" Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. \"There are more girls in school than ever before. More women are doing paid work in senior roles in the private sector, academia, politics and in international organizations, including the United Nations.\"\\xa0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, widely considered one of the world's most powerful women, echoed those sentiments, saying in a video message the struggle for greater equality in Germany and worldwide must continue. She said \"many women before us have made sacrifices and fought persistently so that women would have more rights ... but there's still a lot to do.\" As if to prove that point, Belgian women's groups spoke out angrily as the world of sport provided an immediate and visible target for their struggle. The Belgian football federation, saying it did not want to be taken \"hostage\" by women's groups, refused Thursday to back down from its decision to choose a rapper known for lacing his songs with misogynistic lyrics to produce its official World Cup song. The Women's Forum, a coalition of Belgian women's groups, said it was unacceptable that an artist using degrading lyrics could be picked to produce what should be a unifying song. The U.N. observances drew a number of celebrity participants, including the actress and activist Reese Witherspoon, who said,\\xa0 \"There has been rampant\\xa0sexual abuse within our industry...we decided we were all going to get together. Enough is enough.\" Dania Gurira, a Zimbabwean-American actress and playwright, talked about how she has traveled the world and met with women who have been assaulted or abused. \"No one had ever asked what they have gone through,\" she said.\\xa0 In New York City, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen announced that over $280,000 in zero-interest loans have been pledged to female entrepreneurs, Falk reports.\\xa0  ] ",

      "article": "[   **LOS ANGELES --** A jubilant Ava DuVernay was named entertainer of the year at an NAACP Image Awards ceremony that focused on the black community's power to create change. DuVernay lauded other black artists from the stage as she accepted her award Monday night, naming writers and directors such as Shonda Rhimes, Gina Prince- Bythewood, Kenya Barris and \"Black Panther\" Ryan Coogler. \"This is our time,\" DuVernay said. \"We can say we were here when all this gorgeous art was happening, and that we supported it - that we lifted each other up, that we did as Dr. King said we would do: Live the dream. We're the dream.\" Anthony Anderson hosted the ceremony at the Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California, on what would have been Martin Luther King Jr.'s 89th birthday. While his politically tinged monologue poked fun at the presidential administration and Omarosa Manigault, others used their time onstage to encourage more civic involvement and the fight for social justice. Producer Will Packer took a dig at President Trump's recent comments about immigration as the producer accepted an award for \"Girls Trip,\" which won for outstanding film. \"Sisters, especially the ones from Haiti and Africa, we love you as your brothers,\" he said. Kerry Washington, Tracee Ellis Ross, Laverne Cox, Jurnee Smollet-Bell, Lena Waithe and Angela Robinson set the tone for the evening when they emerged onstage holding hands to dramatically issue a get-out-the-vote call. The six women declared support for the Time's Up initiative to stop sexual harassment and gender discrimination and urged viewers to speak up at the polls as well. \"The midterms are a perfect moment for us to use our voices,\" Robinson said. \"If we can take back a Senate seat in Alabama...\" \"Then we have the ability to shift the imbalance of power,\" Smollet-Bell said. Barris' show \"black-ish\" was the night's big winner. The ABC hit was named best comedy series and took acting honors for stars Ross and Anderson. \"It's an extraordinary thing to be able to show what a beautiful black family looks like on television,\" Ross said as the cast accepted the comedy series honor. \"Power\" was named best drama series, and star Omari Hardwick won for dramatic actor. Other winners included \"Gifted\" actress Octavia Spencer and \"Empire\" star Taraji P. Henson, who were both absent, and Daniel Kaluuya, who won for his leading role in \"Get Out.\" The British actor was clearly delighted at his victory. \"I don't think you're allowed to beat Denzel Washington in acting competitions,\" said Kaluuya, who bested Washington for the prize. The 28-year- old actor thanked his mom and \"Get Out\" writer-director Jordan Peele. \"So many people didn't believe in me, and you did, and you made all of us feel included,\" Kaluuya said. \"Thank you so much for letting us be seen.\" NAACP president Derrik Johnson asked viewers to text in their pledge to vote in 2018 before presenting the President's Award to Danny Glover. Glover was recognized for his professional and philanthropic contributions, particularly his work with the United Nations and his advocacy for labor unions. Glover spoke specifically of a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi, where 80 percent of employees are black, that has yet to organize. \"Civil rights and labor rights have always been one and the same,\" he said. The special awards provided some of the night's most poignant moments. Halle Berry talked about the significance of presenting the NAACP Image Awards on Martin Luther King Jr. day. \"We need to take heed to his eloquent words: 'Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter,'\" she said. \"Today is an affirmation that we will never ever, ever, ever be silent again.\" She presented the Music Makes a Difference award to Charlie Wilson, who talked about his road from addiction and homelessness to musical success and philanthropy. He said he prayed and promised that if he could survive the streets, he would return to serve others. Wilson said Monday that he has been sober for 22 years and is focused on helping homeless addicts. Labor organizer William Lucy received the Chairman's Award for his more than 40 years of service. Beyond his union leadership, Lucy was also an activist who fought apartheid in South Africa. He dedicated his award to the Memphis sanitation workers who went on strike in 1968, several of whom were in the audience at the Image Awards. [King spoke to the striking employees](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/memphis-sanitation- workers-recall-marching-with-martin-luther-king-jr/) the night before he was assassinated. Another arresting moment in the show came during singer Andra Day's chilling performance of Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit.\" Rapper Common joined her for their song \"Stand Up for Something,\" and the whole audience rose to its feet.  ] ",

(Danny Moloshok/Reuters) On a c60 Minutes episode that aired this past weekend, Jennifer Lawrence admitted she was a cmiddle school dropout. It felt like a confession. But it 9s the kind of confession in which Forbes 9s top-earning actress of [2015](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emjl45eddhj/the-worlds- highest-paid-/52496e562057) and [2016](https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/08/23/the-worlds- highest-paid-actresses-2016-jennifer-lawrence-banks-46-million-payday-ahead- of-melissa-mccarthy) humbly admitted to defeating demographic destiny and becoming one of the most successful middle school dropouts ever. In the interview, Lawrence [told CBS reporter Bill Whitaker](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jennifer-lawrence-before-she-was- famous/) she felt cstupid, cdumb and cclueless at school, and that she left at age 14 and moved to New York City to begin acting. Lawrence, now 27, is one of about 12 million U.S. residents 25 or older who never made it past middle school and never earned a GED. Their ranks are shrinking. They 9re increasingly marginalized. And, with one notable exception, they almost never make headlines or star in a four-part cinematic retelling of cThe Hunger Games. Many of them are immigrants. Most are Hispanic, black, Asian, American Indian or of multiple races. They work on farms and in factories, but also on spacecraft and with statistics. In some corners of the labor market, they persist and even thrive. They can have incomes in the top 25 percent, and some are even 1 percenters like Lawrence. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SK0EtHezK0nE1VrBBeILpQKDZgw=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EUBCLR3GLE3YFJEANLM6C46FP4.png)  You find them most in farms and ranches, factories and slaughterhouses. Middle-school dropouts (here applied more broadly to include elementary-school dropouts and those who never attended school) also end up in the country 9s fast-shrinking apparel industry and in lower-paying services jobs. But here prevalence is as much an indicator of survival as it is success: These jobs don 9t lead to top incomes. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qh8mO8GXcgPT12Yw9MdR9hDVESM=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/73V4BR6GNA5K7FDHUJ4QAVGC6A.jpg)  Consider instead the industries where someone who never started high school can earn almost as much as any other worker. They tend to be jobs with low learning requirements or with strong vocational training systems, like barbers\\xa0or truckers. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3asdniWx9QYRmN79j2uJOAWrjDA=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YCIOK4BSIIYAHMPEKGOCLKZ5LU.jpg)  For the record, those high-earning dropout barbers seem to be a quirk of the demographics 4 of approximately 200 industries large enough for this analysis, barbers had the widest median-age gap between middle-school dropouts and the profession as a whole. The margin of error is relatively high, and older workers tend to earn more. Barbers are typical. In about 85 percent of the industries we considered, the median age among workers age 25 and older who didn 9t make it out of middle school was higher than that of\\xa0those who did.\\xa0 Education requirements evolved after World War II, and those born after the conflict were much more likely to have completed middle school than those born before. Immigration policy also had an effect 4 we 9ll touch on that shortly. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3tELRPTqx4ozVcV_XtSIZbeg-pE=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CNP57QGCOMY3BEFRO7OU5YJQSQ.png)  If you instead define success as earning enough to place you in the top 25 percent nationwide, you find a handful of top-earning professions in which the less-educated represent a minuscule but well-compensated share of the industry 9s workforce. Not unlike Jennifer Lawrence in acting. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9OVmarY1EHSCPd8iNZCMO7U3tFQ=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6KMH3F6OYA6IVLHS5VVCLLZXG4.jpg)  These industry distributions help dictate that the most successful middle- school dropouts tend to follow a specific geographic distribution, as well. The states where they earn closest to the overall follow certain industries. States with strong mining, farming and resource extraction 4 and without a large population 4 top the list. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g1fZSYu-UIF7J-V4BPR2SvPhjPs=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JGSUB64YYI6TPKN4P7JL64MEHY.png)  Lawrence 9s home state of Kentucky has the highest share of native-born \\xa0middle-school dropouts (6.1 percent). Texas and California top the list, once you include immigrants. About three out of every five people with less than a middle school education immigrated to the United States. Two out of those three came from Mexico or Central America.\\xa0Many of the others are\\xa0of retirement age. [Every U.S. state](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/statereform/tab5_1.asp) (and D.C.) has made school attendance mandatory through age 16 or higher, barring parental permission or extenuating circumstances. As a result, most Americans who got out before high school were either born before World War II ended or in another country.\\xa0 It shows up in the racial and ethnic distribution. The majority of non- Hispanic white middle-school dropouts are age 65 or older. For comparison, only a fifth of the equivalent Hispanic population is that old. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2XpexikwXfrln6MlYPBSAgf_eMk=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/46N4W6UUEM6LTLA66YFLVF2VCE.jpg)  In raw numbers, Hispanic residents also top the list of the most successful Americans with less than a high school education, based on those older than 25 with positive earnings in the previous year, but their population-adjusted rate is in line with the levels seen by other minority groups. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k2JE35CkjyMR5zjeUvx1X0IvaQo=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V4INPSGPOMYUPFZJRDDVLCJBVQ.jpg)  Jennifer Lawrence is exceptional. She doesn 9t represent a typical middle- school dropout, but then again none of the top-earning dropouts do. It 9s just not a normal outcome. The U.S. economy isn 9t built for someone without an education. The jobs that middle-school dropouts work aren 9t the ones that vault them to the top of the income ladder, and the ones that pay them well employ only a tiny number of lucky individuals, like Lawrence. ] ",

New figures showed the percentage signing up for university last year was 40.7%, up from 37.8% six years ago. A total of 26.8% opted for a college course - up 0.1% on 2011/12. However, the percentage of school leavers going into training has steadily fallen from 4.5% in 2011 to 2.4% in 2016. [According to official statistics](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0053/00531988.pdf), there has been a year-on-year reduction in the percentage of leavers who are unemployed and seeking work or training.    In 2011/12, there were 8.25% who fell into this category, while in 2016/17 that figure was recorded at 4.5%. The latest figures show that almost a quarter, 22%, have taken up employed work, down slightly on the previous year but up by 2.2% on 2011/12 figures.    [Click to see content: school_destinations_scotland](//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/school_destinations_scotland)    School leavers who are engaged in higher education, further education, training, voluntary work, employment and activity agreements are classified as having a \"positive destination\". The statisticians also say that for school leavers living in the most deprived areas, the percentage in a positive destination has increased from 83.9% in 2011/12 to 89.6% in 2016/17. For school leavers living in Scotland's most affluent areas, the percentage in a positive destination has increased from 95.1% in 2011/12 to 96.6% in 2016/17. This latest data was recorded in October 2017, approximately three months after the youngsters left school. Further and Higher Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \"It is vital that every young person leaving school has the opportunity to make the choice that is right for them - whether that be university or college, training or a job. \"Today's statistics show a record proportion of leavers in an initial positive destination and, in particular, a welcome increase to another record in those leavers from the most deprived backgrounds going on to a positive destination.\"  'Pursue radical measures' However, the Scottish Conservatives said the statistics showed that the Scottish government had made \"very little progress\" on closing the attainment gap. Their education spokeswoman, Liz Smith, said: \"The SNP has completely failed to enable the most disadvantaged children to have the same opportunities as their wealthier counterparts when they leave school. \"Higher education is not the only choice for school leavers, but these figures demonstrate that students from poorer backgrounds are much less likely to take this path. \"This has to change, the SNP must pursue the radical measures necessary to make that change.\"  ] ",

The new \"global competences\" test will be carried out alongside maths, reading and science, as part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s influential Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. But some Western countries including England, the United States, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Ireland have decided not to take the global competence test, although they will take the other core academic subject tests. Schools in Scotland, Australia and Canada are among those that will take the global competence test, which is being launched this year. The OECD's Pisa rankings have become important international benchmarks for education systems.    But the economic think tank has decided to introduce a very different kind of test, addressing the type of skills young people need to navigate a world of \"post-truth\" and social media \"echo chambers\".  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The Pisa tests are going to compare countries on how well young people can work together  The concept of global competence was intended to test how well young people were prepared to work alongside people from different cultures and with different beliefs. The test will measure tolerance, cultural awareness and how well teenagers can distinguish between reliable sources of information and fake news. It will consider issues such as racism, cultural identity and prejudice. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, said the success of education systems had to be measured on more than exam results. Speaking in London at the Education World Forum, he said there had to be a greater awareness of \"values\".  Image caption Andreas Schleicher says social media can encourage people to stay within their \"echo chambers\"  Alongside globalisation and the rise of social media, he said, there had been a \"polarisation\" in beliefs, which meant that some teenagers could be left with little awareness of the views of other people. The test is underpinned by the idea that young people should understand other cultures, show respect for \"human dignity\" and be able to objectively analyse information. The OECD has been trailing these plans for a new kind of Pisa test for the past year. But Mr Schleicher said the \"crunch\" point was that some countries were reluctant to be compared on these measures. And there had been a \"hesitation\" about moving from discussing students' beliefs to \"hard data\" from testing them. \"I take a different view. The only way to get serious, the only way to get started with this issue is to look at the truth,\" said the OECD's education chief. Mr Schleicher said that the test would reveal the countries that paid only \"lip service\" to the ideas of tolerance and inclusion. \"What do students actually think? What do students actually know? \"That's the aim of Pisa, to confront us with the real world, not the world of words and beautiful theory,\" he said. The most successful education systems were often the most open and diverse, Mr Schleicher said, giving Canada as an example. The Department for Education in England said Pisa was valued for the information it provided on schools - and that schools would continue to take the other Pisa tests, with the results and rankings to be published next year. But it said that \"like more than half of the 80 countries\" taking Pisa tests, it would not place an \"additional burden\" on schools with the new global competence test. \"All schools are already required to teach pupils to have a mutual respect and tolerance of those of different faiths and beliefs,\" said a DFE spokeswoman. But the Scottish government said it wanted to carry out a test which would help young people to \"thrive in today's world\". \"The results will help us understand how we can further support young people to be responsible global citizens, capable of taking part in local, regional and global decision making and debate,\" said the Scottish government spokeswoman. The OECD says that there are still likely to be changes to the countries participating, but at present there will be 28 countries in the inaugural rankings on global competences - and a further 24 countries will gather data, without students taking the test. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [UK university could access EU funds post-Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42690438)   * [UK exports university ambition scheme to South Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42572139)   * [Liberia's big school experiment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Helping to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * [Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

      "article": "[ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos appeared on CBS 9s c60 Minutes Sunday night and stumbled in answering questions that journalist Lesley Stahl asked during a pointed interview. Stahl repeatedly challenged the education secretary, at one point suggesting that DeVos should visit underperforming public schools to learn about their problems. DeVos responded, cMaybe I should. The secretary also said she is cnot so sure exactly how she became, as Stahl described her, cthe most hated member of President Trump 9s Cabinet but believes that she is cmisunderstood. These are just some of the things that DeVos said 4 or couldn 9t answer 4 during the interview:  * She couldn 9t say whether the number of false accusations of sexual assault on school campuses is lower than the number of actual rapes or assaults.  * Arming teachers cshould be an option for states and communities, she said, even though she couldn 9t cever imagine her first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, having had a gun.  * cWe have invested billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal level, and we have seen zero results, d\\xa0DeVos said 4 a statement Stahl challenged.  * cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them.  * In reference to the MeToo movement, she said she experienced moments decades ago that ctoday would just be viewed as unacceptable. DeVos, who rarely gives interviews to journalists, is a longtime school choice advocate who once said that traditional public education is ca dead end, and she has made clear that her top priority as the nation 9s education chief is expanding alternatives to traditional public schools. She is\\xa0 a champion of using public funds for private and religious school education, and critics say she is determined to privatize public education. DeVos has denied that. DeVos, a billionaire who has spent millions of dollars on school efforts in her home state of Michigan, has been perhaps the most controversial\\xa0of Trump 9s Cabinet members. She became the first Cabinet nominee in history to need a tie-breaking vote from the vice president to be confirmed by\\xa0the Senate. Her January 2017 confirmation hearing before the Senate education panel was marked by her inability to answer basic questions about education. In the c60 Minutes interview, more than a year after becoming education secretary, DeVos again had trouble answering questions and seemed to contradict herself. For example, she and Stahl had this conversation about what happens to underperforming traditional public schools when children leave for alternatives and take funding with them: > STAHL: Why take away money from that school that 9s not working 4 to bring them up to a level where they are,\\xa0that school is working? > > DEVOS: Well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school, school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. > > STAHL: Okay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that 9s not working? What about those kids? > > DEVOS: Well, in places where there have been, where there is, a lot of choice that 9s been introduced, Florida, for example, the studies show that when there 9s a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually, the results get better, as well. > > STAHL: Now, has that happened in Michigan? We 9re in Michigan. This is your home state. > > DEVOS: Yes, well, there 9s lots of great options and choices for students here. > > STAHL: Have the public schools in Michigan gotten better? > > DEVOS: I don 9t know. Overall, I,\\xa0 I can 9t say overall that they have all gotten better. > > STAHL: The whole state is not doing well. > > DEVOS: Well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this, the students are doing well and \\u2026 > > STAHL: No, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. > > DEVOS: I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. > > STAHL: The public schools here are doing worse than they did. > > DEVOS: Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. > > STAHL: Have you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they 9re doing? > > DEVOS: I have not, I have not, I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. > > STAHL: Maybe you should. > > DEVOS: Maybe I should. Yes. And there was this exchange about DeVos and her popularity 4 or, rather, lack of it: > STAHL: Why have you become, people say, the most hated Cabinet secretary? > > DEVOS: I 9m not so sure exactly how that happened. But I think there are a lot of really powerful forces allied against change. > > STAHL: Does it hurt? > > DEVOS: Sometimes it does. Sometimes it does.

That, however, was not a singular moment in the annals of education legislation. State legislators routinely pass legislation about the operations and funding of public schools without asking educators what they think about it 4 or about what the consequences would look like on the ground, at school, every day. In this post, North Carolina veteran teacher Justin Parmenter looks at this phenomenon as it relates to legislation involving class size in the state. Parmenter teaches seventh-grade language arts at Waddell Language Academy in Charlotte and is a fellow with Hope Street Group 9s North Carolina Teacher Voice Network, which provides feedback to education policymakers. His first teaching job was at a school on the White Mountain Apache Reservation in the poorest county in Arizona, where young people face extraordinary challenges. He started his career as a Peace Corps volunteer in Albania and taught in Istanbul. He was a finalist for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Teacher of the Year in 2016, and you can find him on Twitter here: [@JustinParmenter](https://twitter.com/justinparmenter) This first [appeared on the website of EducationNC](https://www.ednc.org/2018/01/31/unintended-consequences- legislation-deserves-educators-touch/), a nonprofit corporation, and I was given permission to publish it. _**By Justin Parmenter**_ Recently the education news waves in North Carolina have been dominated by talk of the impending class size crisis. Across the state, school districts are facing awful choices: cutting arts, physical education, and foreign language classes, swelling numbers at 4th grade and above to 40+ students, and holding classes in hallways in order to comply with an unrealistic law quietly inserted into the state budget in 2016. When public outcry first began over the legislative changes, some state legislators acknowledged the law 9s shortsightedness. House Education Committee Chair [Craig Horn admitted](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/education/article127421184.html) the mandate was not cfully thought through with regard to unintended consequences. But with the quality of our public education at stake, how does a law like this get passed in the first place? And what can be done to prevent it from happening in the future? With many education professionals right down the road at the Department of Public Instruction and thousands more experienced teachers in the field, every piece of education legislation should be thoroughly and systematically informed by best educational practices in order to yield optimal outcomes for our students. Unfortunately, North Carolina 9s General Assembly has a pattern dating back to when Democrats were in power of fast-tracking major education initiatives by placing them as special provisions in the budget to avoid the public debate and stakeholder input so vital to the creation of effective policy. The current class size crisis may be the most recent example of what can happen when a legislature fails to listen to educators, but it 9s hardly the first. The literacy program Read to Achieve 4 created five years ago 4 suffered from the same malady. When Read to Achieve was passed in 2012, [the legislation](http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/docs/k-3literacy/achieve/hb950.pdf) was intended to end social promotion and help 3rd graders avoid what Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger has called the c[economic death sentence](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics- columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article10292111.html) awaiting students who are unable to read proficiently. According to the legislation, The goal of the state is to ensure that every student read at or above grade level by the end of third grade and continue to progress in reading proficiency so that he or she can read, comprehend, integrate, and apply complex texts needed for secondary education and career success. Berger 9s intentions may have been laudable, but it 9s clear that Read to Achieve 9s implementation lacks the educator 9s touch. The initiative attempted to improve reading by increasing the volume of assessment in grades K-3 and ratcheting up the threats of retention, essentially punishing children for not being able to read well enough in early grades. That 9s not the approach an effective teacher would take. A good educator works to understand where the child is coming from and develop unique supports that best fit his or her individual circumstances. A good educator knows that punitive measures seldom result in long term success. According to former N.C. Superintendent Dr. June Atkinson, when Read to Achieve was drafted, the Department of Instruction was very candid about the challenges it presented and the impact it would have. The department warned the General Assembly that the volume of portfolio assessments the legislation added to 3rd grade was too high and that the pace and funding of implementation didn 9t provide enough professional development for teachers to effectively transition to the new system. The General Assembly had also [slashed pre-K funding 25](https://imgur.com/a/LOdAs)[\\xa0percent](https://imgur.com/a/LOdAs)\\xa0from pre-recession levels at the time, and the department informed legislators that quality early childhood education was an important component of building a foundation for literacy. All of that feedback fell largely on deaf ears. Data from a comprehensive [2014 University of North Carolina at Greensboro study](https://www.docdroid.net/Wff4ZGH/rta-report-serve-9514.pdf) on the first year of Read to Achieve reveals that the program struggled mightily from the beginning as a result of state lawmakers disregarding the advice of education professionals. The survey included responses from 66 district superintendents, 729 elementary principals, and more than 3,000 elementary teachers. Respondents said that ceducator input should have been more systematically and extensively sought in the design of the Reach to Achieve components and statewide rollout, and indicated a need for more flexibility in using state funds for reading interventions. Eighty percent of K-2 teachers and 93 percent of 3rd grade teachers felt that Read to Achieve had cresulted in a significant loss of instructional time. Perhaps most concerning of all, teachers reported the number and intensity of assessments were cnegatively impacting some students 9 attitudes toward reading and their enjoyment of teaching. The report detailed educator 9s feelings about the first year of Read to Achieve, and anecdotal information I collected from elementary teachers in various parts of the state suggests that little has changed. Teachers still report that students and educators alike are overwhelmed by the number of assessments and that Read to Achieve 9s inflexible requirements are reducing time spent on other important topics such as writing instruction. As one teacher put it, cWe spend so much time testing that we honestly just don 9t have the time to teach. If a student doesn 9t do well then there is no time to go back and reteach, but instead hope that they have time to tutor after school. Schools still lack money to be able to provide more reading specialists to work intensively with struggling readers. Pre-K funding has improved slightly, but quality early education is still out of reach for many of our families. If state Senator Phil Berger 9s goal was to improve 3rd grade reading, Read to Achieve does not appear to be working. Since the law was passed in 2012, the number of our state 9s 3rd graders reading on grade level has actually _dropped_ 3.1 percent: ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bYDL8WBdf2kOohq2VttsUkOTKMA=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAMPWYMAHU7R5AVSXBFWEXRNK4.jpg)  In addition, the number of students retained for not demonstrating reading proficiency on third-grade standards has risen each year since Read to Achieve was implemented, except for last school year when it remained flat. [For clarification](http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/docs/k-3literacy/resources/guidebook.pdf), students retained do not necessarily repeat the grade but are retained in a third grade accelerated class, placed in a transition class with a retained label, or placed in a fourth grade accelerated class with a retained reading label. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UPIlAsemvFzmXIIBZOdnfVtpSvE=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZIXZLJ3XWY62BCRC6ENUH6TK44.jpg)  Had the General Assembly truly partnered with the Department of Instruction on improving early grades reading, the results might have been very different. Legislators could have provided the requested high-quality pre-K for more students, allowing them to enter kindergarten with a stronger foundation on which to build. They could have given instructional flexibility to districts rather than burying students from Franklin to Currituck under piles of inauthentic assessments that sap student motivation. If our leaders had been willing to allocate the resources, the law could have provided additional reading specialists and given existing teachers the professional development they need to find new, engaging strategies for supporting our struggling readers. Regrettably, that 9s not what happened. As the saying goes, those who don 9t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Despite clear evidence that dismissing the advice of professional educators leads to poor results for our students, the General Assembly is continuing that pattern today. What starts out as a decent idea and effective campaign flyer bullet point ends up causing major damage because of poorly informed execution. In 2016, lawmakers [inserted a major class size reduction](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op- ed/article140389748.html) for grades K-3 into the state budget and passed it with little debate and no funding. Just like with Read to Achieve, the intention behind class size reduction was not the problem 4 no educator or parent would argue against smaller teacher-student ratios. The major flaw of this legislation was in the execution, in the idea that such an improvement could be had for free with no adverse side effects. Then-Superintendent Atkinson reports there was minimal discussion between the General Assembly and the Department of Public Instruction prior to the creation of the class size law 4 a shocking fact given how this legislation stood to change the landscape of our schools. The collaboration was limited largely to the department providing legislators with comprehensive data. The Department of Instruction also reportedly informed the General Assembly that reducing class size was a huge mistake without sufficient dollars, specifically explaining the consequences for North Carolina 9s schools if the law was passed but not funded. After the class size reduction passed, public outrage quickly grew as parents, school officials and teachers became aware of the reality they faced. While our lawmakers waste valuable time alternating between [blaming school districts](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics- columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article141460764.html) for the crisis and [assuring the public](http://www.wral.com/lawmakers-nearing-agreement-on- class-size-fix/17292305/) there is no need for alarm, 1.5 million students and more than 180,000 staff watch our state inch ever closer to crisis. Parents are faced with the reality of children with no exposure to arts and PE classes so crucial to nurturing creative minds and healthy bodies. Teachers at grades 4 and above are wondering how they 9ll be able to teach such large numbers of students 4 and whether they 9ll have to do so in hallways or closets because of the lack of sufficient classrooms. All over North Carolina, budgets are due to county commissions on May 15, and preparations must begin in earnest for next school year, with year-round schools set to start classes in early July. The most frustrating part of this mess is that it could have been prevented if the General Assembly had chosen to work with the Department of Instruction to set attainable goals on class sizes. So where do we go from here? How do we cultivate productive partnerships between educators and legislators so that the laws that impact so many of our children are informed by the experience and perspective that can make them more effective? Imagine how different things could be if we developed a process for authentic dialogue between the classroom and the General Assembly. Picture a gathering of teachers and legislators in the same room 4 not for a photo op, but for real talk about specific problems and solutions in our schools. Such convenings could be by facilitated by groups such as the Hope Street Group or the Public School Forum, organizations with access to networks of teachers who are eager to engage with policymakers if that interaction can lead to better policy. A legislator with an education bill in the draft phase could participate in a roundtable discussion with teachers who have experience directly relevant to that particular bill, everything from early grades reading to dropout prevention. Convenings could occur in person initially, then virtually as the bill moves through the process. Another idea could be to create a teacher advisory body that checks in regularly with members of education committees in both the state House and the state Senate as laws make their way through the committees, helping to ensure their work takes into account best practices and the reality of the classroom. This meaningful collaboration would improve the quality of our legislation and build a valuable bridge between two groups that have been throwing stones at each other instead of working together for far too long. Teachers, do you have any additional ideas on what more effective partnerships with lawmakers might look like? Members of the General Assembly, are you open to the possibility of developing a closer working relationship with educators? The short session is right around the corner. Springtime in North Carolina would be a great time to renew our commitment to trying to do better for our children ] ",

      "article": "[  The Department of Education has begun notifying some former Corinthian Colleges students that they won't receive full loan forgiveness.\\xa0 The Education Department will forgive only one-half or less of their federal student loans, even though the students were defrauded by the now-defunct schools, the Associated Press has learned. The action is part of the Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' push to ease regulations governing for-profit schools. DeVos says she wants to protect taxpayers' money, but critics say that the Trump administration has deep ties to for-profit colleges and is putting industry interests ahead of students. Two weeks ago, Sarah Dieffenbacher, a California health care worker, received a letter saying the agency would only discharge 50 percent of her student loans. The mother of four had borrowed about $67,000 to train as a paralegal at Everest college in Ontario, California, part of the Corinthian chain, but was unable to land a single job in the field. In her first interview since receiving the agency's decision, Dieffenbacher told the AP Thursday that the decision was utterly unfair. \"I think it's an insult to my intelligence, I think it's a kick in my face, I think it's degrading,\" Dieffenbacher said. \"I received no valuable education from them.\" Critics of for-profit colleges said they tended to target specific types of young people: low-income students with a desire to further their education and land a better job, but who lacked guidance on college choices. Others claimed the for-profit colleges [promised them jobs after they graduated](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/feeling-burned-for-profit-college- grads-want-loans-erased/), but found employers had negative views of the colleges and struggled to secure work. Alec Harris, Dieffenbacher's attorney with the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University said: \"There is no justification for making Sarah and others pay for having been cheated. The Department's actions are incoherent and vindictive.\"    Department press secretary Liz Hill would not comment on Dieffenbacher's specific case and referred the AP to an earlier statement from DeVos. The secretary announced in December that she was breaking with the Obama administration's practice of fully wiping out the loans of defrauded for- profit students and would grant some only partial relief. \"No fraud is acceptable, and students deserve relief if the school they attended acted dishonestly,\" DeVos said in December. The new process will be more efficient and \"protects taxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified.\" Hill also would not provide data on how many students have received partial relief announcements. The agency has tens of thousands of claims from students pending. The relief grant to Dieffenbacher was made by comparing the average earnings of students in her program to the average earnings of students who graduated from similar programs at other schools, according to the department's letter viewed by the AP. This approach was criticized when it was unveiled in December. Student advocates argued that the formula does not take into account whether Corinthian graduates are employed in the fields of their study or are simply working other jobs. Such is the case with Dieffenbacher, 40, who was unable to get hired in legal field. She says the school lied to her about credit transfers, job placement prospects and the quality of her education. She went on to train in a different field and now works as a phlebotomist. \"If you want to show me a degree from Everest that I can use to proceed in the legal field, then I would call it value,\" Dieffenbacher said. \"How can you value something that doesn't exist?\" Dieffenbacher says her entire income goes to support her children and she has no money to pay off the loan. She said she will not accept the agency's decision. Dieffenbacher is also suing the department in a parallel case to stop it from garnishing her wages. Clare McCann, a higher education expert with the New America Foundation, said DeVos was shortchanging students who have been cheated out of their money, time and career prospects. \"The formula that the department designed is meant to give a minimal amount of the relief to harmed borrowers,\" McCann said. \"It is completely possible the somebody could be working full time in a position unrelated to their fields of study and get little to no relief on their loans.\"    The Obama administration went hard after the for-profit sector, closing down defunct for-profit chains, including Corinthian, and putting in place tougher regulations. Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by Corinthian and other schools had more than $550 million in federal student loans canceled in full. Since coming to office DeVos froze those regulations and her office has also been assisting a suspended accrediting agency that oversees for-profit schools in trying to come back to life. A spokesman for Career Education Colleges, the main lobbying group for the sector, was not immediately available for comment. Rick Hess, head of education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute said DeVos' approach was more responsible. \"Any of us who has ever taken a loan for a house or car or a degree would like 100 percent loan forgiveness, we also pay taxes and we want people who borrow public dollars typically to repay them,\" Hess said. \"But I think that what this administration is getting right is trying to strike that balance between respecting the rights to wronged borrowers and respecting the rights of taxpayers.\"  ] ",

      "article": "[ Laws prohibiting employers from asking job candidates about their past compensation before making a salary offer are gaining momentum, aimed at reducing pay disparities and other obstacles confronting women and minorities. , The premise is simple: Judging an applicant 9s worth from his or her previous salary can perpetuate pay gaps that arise from discrimination 4 or make it hard to get in the door at all. , Laws banning the practice have taken effect in New York City, Delaware and California in recent months. But the way some researchers see it, such laws are likely to be ineffective or even backfire. For example, employers who can 9t ask about prior salary might assume that a female candidate would accept less money than a man, because women make less on average. ,  cIt seems like the general social impulse is, 8We don 9t like employers using particular information, so we 9ll tell them they can 9t use it any more and assume that 9s the end of the conversation, 9 said Jennifer Doleac, an economist at the University of Virginia. cBut if they cared enough about it to ask it to begin with, they probably care about it enough to try to guess. , Ms. Doleac pointed to [some recent studies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795795), including [one on which she was an author](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22469.pdf), showing that employers engaged in precisely this kind of guessing after several cities and states prohibited questions about candidates 9 criminal records early in the application process. In her study, employers appeared to assume that young black and Hispanic men were more likely than members of other groups to have a criminal conviction and hired fewer of them once the policies were in place. , But the consequences may not be as clear when it comes to salary history. Some academic evidence suggests that the new laws may help women in certain circumstances. , To anticipate the effects of such laws, it 9s worth exploring why employers ask about a candidate 9s salary history in the first place. Here are a few reasons. , If employers know what a candidate previously made, they effectively know how little that person will accept. ,  cOn one level, I 9d like to pay people the least amount of money to get the most amount of benefit from that person, said Adam Klein of the employment law firm Outten & Golden, who has represented many workers in discrimination cases. ,  cUnder that market-efficiency construct, why wouldn 9t you pay women less? Mr. Klein said, channeling a hypothetical employer who can ask lower-paid women about their salaries. cIt makes business sense. , Several economists said a ban on questions about salary history would probably prompt such employers to engage in what 9s known as statistical discrimination 4 relying on group averages in place of information they were previously able to obtain about an individual. , (Alternatively, employers may try to get the information in slightly less direct ways, like asking candidates about their minimum salary expectation, Mr. Klein said.) , In doing so, employers will be further enabled by another feature of the recent salary history laws: They typically allow job applicants to disclose their previous salary voluntarily. As a result, some employers may feel comfortable making lowball offers to women, because they assume applicants will speak up if they make significantly more than the employer 9s offer. Those who don 9t speak up will be deemed to have made less. , This could, in turn, leave women worse off than before, since they tend to be more reluctant to bargain than men, as a [range of studies](http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/social-incentives-gender-differences- propensity-initiate-negotiations-sometimes-it-does-hurt-ask) have documented. ,  cBy adding that hoop 4 putting them in a position where they have to negotiate more 4 I imagine it widening the gender gap, Ms. Doleac said. , By asking what the candidate currently makes and paying the same or slightly more, an employer may simply want to ensure that an offer is accepted and that the new hire is satisfied 4 but may be oblivious to the risk of perpetuating pay disparities. ,  cWhat we are seeing is the myth of the sneaky employer, said Andrew Hoan, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. ,  cIn Brooklyn, a high percentage of all firms in the borough are 50-person firms or less, Mr. Hoan added. cThe C.E.O. is the person making the offer. Frankly, he or she has no time to go around and create comparable stats. All this stuff they 9re doing now is simply streamlining the process. , Where this is true, banning salary-history questions could help substantially, advocates say. ,  cIn companies that are treating people the same, and not thinking about how their behavior might differentially harm people, this type of law raises awareness of it, said Joelle Emerson, the founder and chief executive of Paradigm, a firm that advises employers on promoting diversity. cIt forces companies to sit down and say: 8O.K., why were we doing this before? How should we set compensation now that we don 9t do it this way? 9 , At Dime Community Bank, which employs about 400 people at 29 branches in the New York City area, the standard job application asked candidates for their salary history until shortly before the New York ban took effect in October. , Angela Blum-Finlay, the bank 9s head of human resources, said that she had already begun de-emphasizing salary history in determining compensation beforehand, and that she was asking hiring managers to use competitive benchmarks for different positions instead. , Ms. Finlay said that it was counterproductive for employers to try to squeeze candidates on compensation, especially in a tight labor market. ,  cWe are, at Dime, trying to be an employer of choice, a place people want to come, she said. cIf I lowball you coming in, I 9m not going to make you feel valued. , Standard economic theory holds that workers are paid in line with their productivity, so a higher salary should imply a better worker. , In effect, employers may also be using salary on the front end of the hiring process 4 to help determine whom they want to interview 4 rather than solely on the back end, when preparing an offer. , But restrictions on asking for salary information can play out very differently in those situations. When employers want to know how little money a worker will accept, and the law prevents them from asking, they may rely on cruder information, like stereotypes. , But when employers want to know how good a worker is, they have several alternatives to considering salary history, many of them more revealing. They can, for example, interview the candidate, read letters of recommendation, and talk to former employers and co-workers. , In a [recent study](http://moshebarach.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/WageHistory.pdf), the economists John Horton of New York University and Moshe Barach of Georgetown University conducted an experiment on a prominent online freelancing platform and found that employers responded in precisely this way. , During a roughly two-week period in 2014, half the employers in the experiment were no longer able to view the wage history of prospective workers, as they had in the past, while the other half could continue to see workers 9 wage history. , Compared with employers who had the wage information, those without it ended up interviewing and hiring workers who, on average, had made significantly less money in the past. When employers could no longer consult salary history, they expanded the pool of workers they considered and went to greater lengths to evaluate them. ,  cYou 9re widening the top of the hiring funnel, Mr. Barach said. cIt doesn 9t allow you to as easily throw people away. , He and Mr. Horton acknowledged that because this approach required spending more time collecting information, employers might not find it worthwhile when filling a low-skilled or entry-level job. In those cases, they might retreat to stereotypes involving gender or race, as other economists have suggested. , But cfor some range of jobs, Mr. Barach said, cmore upfront costs could have benefits down the road. If you actually talk to someone, interview them, it will allow you to locate a high-quality candidate. ] ",

Rappler was called out by the president. Investigated. Called out again. Investigated again. cIt 9s a blatant abuse of power, Ressa said. Ressa and Rappler are at the center of a fight over the future of press freedom in the Philippines that is testing the foundations of Philippine democracy. It is a fight that resonates far beyond this U.S. ally, as the world comes to grips with a new breed of populist authoritarians who bask in positive coverage and decry the rest as\\xa0 cfake news. When President Trump met Duterte in Manila this past November, for instance, the Philippine president [called](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning- mix/wp/2017/11/14/trump-chuckled-as-duterte-called-journalists-spies-thats-no- laughing-matter-in-the-philippines/?utm_term=.265c8a3e96b4) reporters trying to ask questions about human rights cspies. Trump 9s response? A laugh, according to the transcript. Duterte was elected in 2016 on a promise to kill suspected drug users and dealers.

But he also has railed against the press in ways that are revealing 4 and deeply worrying to reporters and editors. \\xa0 The Philippines has long been a dangerous place to be a journalist; since 1986, 177 media workers have been [killed](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/11 /philippine-journalist-killings-demand-state-action)\\xa0here.

(Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images) Since taking office, Duterte has threatened to block the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN, a major television station that at times has been critical of police- led violence linked to his anti-drug campaign. He also has taken aim at the Philippine Daily Inquirer 9s coverage.\\xa0 cI 9m not trying to scare you, but one day karma will catch up with you, the president warned both outlets in March 2017.\\xa0 Months later, the Inquirer 9s owner said it would sell its stake to a billionaire ally of the president, a move seen by local and foreign analysts as a [forced retreat](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/opinion/journalism- rodrigo-duterte-philippines.html).  cThe sale of the Inquirer to a businessman friend of Duterte is worrying, Ressa said. cThe Inquirer has weathered other administrations. Here it buckled without firing a shot. Reporters, rights groups and foreign diplomats said that media outlets are now worried about becoming his next target if 4 as Duterte put it 4 they get too\\xa0 crude. For Ressa and Rappler, the trouble began around the time of the 2016 presidential election, when Ressa and others started getting harassed and threatened by pro-Duterte social media accounts. This was not average Internet harassment but coordinated streams of messages, including death and rape threats,\\xa0that the organization has since traced to Facebook groups and blogs that helped get Duterte elected.\\xa0 Ressa calls it the\\xa0 cweaponization of social media.  cIt created a chilling effect on journalists, critics, any person who questions the extrajudicial killings, she said. In July 2017, Duterte used his first state-of-the-nation address to call out Rappler, [implying](https://www.rappler.com/nation/176566-full-text-president- rodrigo-duterte-sona-2017-philippines) without citing evidence that it was not Filipino-owned.

Rappler has continued to operate while an appeal is heard. The move against Rappler cwas politically motivated, said one senior Western diplomat in Manila who was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on the condition of anonymity. cThe case is a bit complicated, but to come up with a ruling that quick has never been done. Soon after, Rappler 9s star political reporter, Pia Ranada, was blocked from covering presidential events.

A presidential security official later said Ranada should [consider herself lucky](https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/02/21/duterte-loss-of-trust-triggered- decision-to-block-rappler/) that security personnel did not hurt her when she was\\xa0 cdisrespectful to the guard who turned her away from an event.\\xa0 Most recently, with the Securities and Exchange Commission case at the court of appeals, the government announced it is investigating Rappler for allegedly evading $2.5\\xa0million in taxes.

And yet, two months after [Mayor Bill de Blasio announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/nyregion/farina-chancellor- retire-legacy-successor.html) that Chancellor Carmen Fari\\xf1a [would ](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/nyregion/carmen-farina-nyc-schools- retire.html)[retire](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/nyregion/carmen- farina-nyc-schools-retire.html), the spot remains unfilled. , That the mayor has not yet made a choice 4 he said the administration had already been searching for several months in late December 4 points to the challenge of finding a match between a politically ambitious mayor with close ties to the teachers 9 union and a candidate with the requisite managerial skill and national reputation. , Ms. Fari\\xf1a remains in the job and will leave cin the next month or so, the mayor 9s press secretary, Eric Phillips, said last week. , Among the candidates under consideration is [Barbara M. Jenkins](https://www.ocps.net/superintendent/superintendent_s_profile), the superintendent of the Orange County Public Schools in Orlando, Fla. The district serves about 200,000 students, 66 percent of whom are Hispanic or black. Dr. Jenkins has led some similar initiatives to Ms. Fari\\xf1a 9s, notably a major push to increase the number of students taking Advanced Placement courses. Under her leadership, the district in 2014 won the Broad Prize for Urban Education, in part for narrowing racial and economic achievement gaps and for increasing college readiness. , She is under consideration by the de Blasio team, according to someone informed about the search who requested anonymity to speak about confidential conversations. , Dr. Jenkins did not respond to an email and a phone call. , Another candidate who has been considered, [MaryEllen Elia](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/nyregion/maryellen-elia-named-new- york-state-education-commissioner.html), is the New York State education commissioner, and would be a more conservative choice. Ms. Elia, 69, a former superintendent of schools in Florida 9s Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, has pursued a modest and conciliatory course, and she gets along well with Ms. Fari\\xf1a. But a person with knowledge of the search said that she was probably a long shot given concerns about her effectiveness in her current job. , A spokeswoman for the state education department said that Ms. Elia chas had no discussions about this. , [Kathleen Cashin](https://www.regents.nysed.gov/members/cashin-kathleen-m), a member of the Board of Regents and a former superintendent in New York City, has also been considered, according to the person informed about the search. Dr. Cashin has been a critic of the state 9s Common Core-aligned tests and of using test scores to evaluate teachers. , Dr. Cashin said she has not been interviewed. , Under Mr. de Blasio 9s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, the city was recognized as a hotbed of education reform, a front-runner in the push to use data, especially test scores, to evaluate schools, principals and teachers. Mr. Bloomberg 9s schools chancellor, Joel Klein, began giving schools letter grades and pioneered the practice of closing low-performing schools and replacing them with new schools on a large scale. , Under Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Fari\\xf1a, New York City 9s direction has been symbolic of a larger national retreat from the data-driven approach. cA little bit of the air has gone out of the reform balloon, said [Robert Pondiscio](https://edexcellence.net/about-us/fordham-staff/robert-pondiscio), a senior fellow at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank. If the movement 9s preferred strategies were cgoing to drive watershed changes in outcomes in American education, we would have seen evidence of it by now, and I just don 9t think we have, he said. , During his first campaign, Mr. de Blasio promised to de-emphasize test scores, end the school grading system and put a pause on closures. He has kept those promises. The Bloomberg administration fought with the teachers 9 union; Mr. de Blasio was endorsed by it. , Ms. Fari\\xf1a has focused on strategies like reforming school discipline, encouraging teacher collaboration and putting social services in schools. Mr. de Blasio 9s biggest success has come in expanding prekindergarten for all children, and the education department has used the idea of equity across schools to add algebra in more middle schools and increase access to Advanced Placement courses. It now offers the SAT free to all high school students. , While critics see the de Blasio administration 9s efforts as small-bore, supporters say that this work can make a big difference. ,  cI think it 9s not well understood outside of New York how much this chancellor has emphasized instruction, said [Lynette Guastaferro](http://www.teachingmatters.org/about/team/lynette), the executive director of Teaching Matters, an organization that supports schools in New York City in increasing teacher effectiveness. , For the next chancellor, Ms. Guastaferro said, cThe opportunity is to take the ideas that are in play now and to take them to the next level. , But the system remains sharply segregated, with seemingly intractable achievement gaps and little action by the administration to push for integration. , Mr. de Blasio 9s search committee is made up of insiders from City Hall and the Education Department. Mr. de Blasio has pledged not to choose someone from outside education, as Mr. Bloomberg did twice, and the committee is focusing on people who have previously run urban districts. Given the makeup of the city 9s schools, which are nearly 70 percent black and Hispanic, many expect a new chancellor who looks like the student body. , Making things harder, the job is relatively low paid. Ms. Fari\\xf1a 9s current salary is $234,569. The superintendent in Los Angeles, the nation 9s second largest district with more than 640,000 students, makes $350,000. , Mr. de Blasio 9s relationship with the teachers 9 union has led some to suggest that [Randi Weingarten](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/randi_weingarten/index.html), the president of the American Federation of Teachers and former president of the city union, will have veto power over the choice. Ms. Weingarten said she had cnot had one conversation with the mayor about this, though she said some candidates had called to consult with her before being interviewed. , Ms. Weingarten said that she was cnot pushing for anybody but that she believed [Kelvin R. Adams](https://www.slps.org/Page/107), the superintendent of the St. Louis public schools, could do the job. When Dr. Adams was appointed in 2008, the state board of education had revoked the district 9s accreditation and given control to an appointed board. Since then, the district, which serves close to 22,000 students, roughly 80 percent of them African-American, has improved significantly, and its accreditation was restored last year. , Asked through a spokeswoman whether he had been interviewed for the job, Dr. Adams declined to comment. , Mr. Phillips, the mayor 9s spokesman, said on Wednesday that Mr. de Blasio would make a decision soon. , [Paul Hill](https://www.crpe.org/experts/paul-hill), a professor at the University of Washington and the founder of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, said that there was a cyclical nature to the leadership of school systems, where the aggressive innovations of an outsider like Mr. Klein lead to demands for can insider, somebody that educators identify with, like Ms. Fari\\xf1a, who had been a teacher and principal in New York. , He said that New York was due now for another outsider, if perhaps one less confrontational than Mr. Klein. What is needed, Dr. Hill said, is csomebody that thinks about the system as a system. ] ",

And many children from more privileged families who attend nongovernment schools receive English tuition from day care through high school. , Iran 9s Islamic leaders have often warned about the dangers of a ccultural invasion, and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, voiced outrage in 2016 over the cteaching of the English language spreading to nursery schools. , Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final say in all state matters, said in that speech to teachers, cThat does not mean opposition to learning a foreign language, but (this is the) promotion of a foreign culture in the country and among children, young adults and youths. ,  cWestern thinkers have time and again said that instead of colonialist expansionism ... the best and the least costly way would have been inculcation of thought and culture to the younger generation of countries, Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to the text of the speech posted on Leader.ir, a website run by his office. , While there was no mention of the announcement being linked to [recent protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/world/middleeast/iran-protests- arrests.html?src=twr) against the clerical establishment and government, Iran 9s Revolutionary Guards have blamed [foreign enemies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/middleeast/iran-protests- foreign-enemies.html) for fomenting the unrest. , Iranian officials said at least 21 people were killed and more than 1,000 arrested during the protests that spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns, as thousands of young and working-class Iranians expressed their anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor. , A video of the ban announcement was widely circulated on social media on Sunday, with Iranians calling it cthe filtering of English, jokingly comparing it to the government 9s [blocking of the popular app Telegram](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/technology/iran-protests-social- media.html) during the protests. ] ",

Liberia, which [elected a new president last week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news /world-africa-42507405), has among the highest percentage of out-of-school primary children in the world.  **In a bid to improve the availability and quality of schools, the West African country has been carrying out a controversial experiment.**  **It has asked a range of non-government organisations to run some of the country's state schools, to see how results compare.**  **Supporters defend this as bold innovation which will raise standards. Opponents say it is a pathway to privatising the state school system.**  **David Laws, a former education minister in England and executive chairman of the Education Partnerships Group, has been advising Liberia's government on the project. He gives his views on the findings so far.**    * * * \"Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world and its education system lags behind most countries, in both access and quality. Fewer than 40% of children complete primary education. And among adult women who finished elementary school just one in four could read a sentence.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The results of the school experiment are being monitored by international researchers  If you were education minister in such a country, you might be tempted to try a big, bold, experiment - and that is exactly what the government has done, with Liberia's high profile and sometimes controversial Partnership Schools for Liberia programme. Liberian ministers, including Education Minister Werner, last year decided to transfer the management of 93 government schools to eight private operators - mostly international school groups, but also some home grown operators. These 93 schools remained state schools - with government teachers, open enrolment, and no fees. For those who think this sounds like the academies programme which has been rolled out in England - well, you're right. Except that it took England seven years to grow its academies programme to the size Liberia achieved overnight. And, perhaps unlike in England, Liberian ministers decided to do something else just as bold - they would support a rigorous, independent, evaluation of their own policy.  How to measure the impact? Alongside the 93 privately-managed government schools would be a similar number of government \"control\" schools, to test whether the private operators were genuinely doing better. Instead of the government marking its own homework, researchers from the Center for Global Development in Washington DC and the University of California at San Diego oversaw a selected sample of 3,499 students in 185 schools.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Liberia has one of the world's biggest problems in the lack of school places  As the evaluators fanned out across Liberia, navigating unmade roads and swollen rivers, the international controversy about the so-called \"PSL\" programme began to hot up. Supporters of public-private partnerships claimed that the improved private sector management would inevitably raise results. Others claimed that education was being \"privatised\", and that improvements would fail to emerge or not be sustainable across the whole school system.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Supporters of George Weah celebrated his presidential election victory last week  When I visited the country last year, the potential for improvement was clearly visible - many of the PSL schools, for example, reporting that they were now able to take action to replace the teachers who had failed to turn up for classes, when the government was running the schools. But the scale of the challenge was also clear - and the new operators had been given limited notice of which schools and how many they were going to be taking on.  What are the results so far? The first year of \"PSL\" is now complete, and the results from the initial evaluation of the programme are in. What do they show? For the supporters of the \"Partnership Schools\", there are some pretty impressive statistics. Students in these schools made learning gains of more than half an extra year of schooling in English, and two thirds of an extra year in maths - versus the government schools.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The experiment also raises questions about funding levels for pupils in Liberia  On average learning gains were 60% higher in partnership schools in the experiment compared with the government schools being used as a control. Teachers in the Partnership schools were 20% more likely to be in school during a random spot check (from a dreadful baseline figure of just 40% in comparator government schools), while students spent roughly twice as long learning each week. So does this prove the case for the reformers? Should the government not simply turn over the whole system to private operators? Sadly, it's not quite as simple as that. The PSL schools did better, but they also received more money. On top of the usual government budget of a mere $50 (\\xa337) per child per year, PSL schools received an additional allocation from external funders/operators of at least $50 more per child. Indeed, the evaluators estimate some operators spent a lot more than that - around $663 (\\xa3480) per child in one case. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Helping to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * [Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * [Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * [The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * [From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * [Terror survivor campaigns for open speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)? Get in touch with sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * * Now, some of these costs may be particularly high at the beginning of the programme, and could come down over time. But the programme can only be regarded as fully scaleable if the government can substantially increase its own education spending, or encourage donors to fill the yawning gap. What else? Well, the evaluators found that government assigned 37% more teachers to PSL schools than non PSL schools, including first pick of better- trained, new, graduates. If this programme is to be scaled up across all Liberia's schools, then a big increase in the supply of trained teachers will be necessary.  What are the lessons? So, must we conclude that little can be learned from the Liberian experiment? This seems to be too pessimistic. Indeed, it's interesting that while learning gains differed widely across the eight operators, these gains did not necessarily correlate with the higher spending.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The experiment in Liberia has been the focus of international attention  One of the lowest cost operators achieved one of the best results for student learning. That suggests that the improvement in education may not just be about pouring in lots of money. There could be other gains in management and teaching practice, that do not require such large dollops of extra cash. Liberia's experiment in school reform is still in its early days - with two more years of evaluation to go. We know from experience elsewhere that programme impacts can vary significantly over time. Liberia also needs to make sure that it can manage and hold to account private operators, in a country with limited government capacity. But for education reformers worldwide and for the children of Liberia, this has been a promising intervention - the challenge is now to build up government capacity and bring down costs. Both are likely to be necessary if a promising experiment can truly change the face of Liberian education.\"  _David Laws was Schools Minister in England from 2012-2015.

If the Department of Education and Arts is indeed eliminated, many of its programs will be spun off and moved to -- the Department of Education.

      "article": "[ GANGNEUNG, South Korea 4 In the Canadian news media, there have already been demands for summits and special committees. A national crisis is at hand, except it has nothing to do with social services or education or income inequality. , No, this is an issue that merits immediate action after a debacle on a global stage. , We 9re talking, of course, about curling. , In an unprecedented flameout, the Canadian men 9s and women 9s curling teams were shut out of medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics. , Two days after the women finished with a 4-5 record in pool play, which left them without any hope of contending for a spot on the podium, the men lost to Switzerland on Friday in the match to award the bronze medal. , _Fourth place!_ , The only consolation for Canada? Gold in mixed doubles, a new event at the Olympics and one that some highly opinionated purists from curling hotbeds like Manitoba and Saskatchewan consider a diluted version of the sport. , Yet after the Canadian men 9s and women 9s teams filled the past 10 days with light draws (curling talk for a bad shot), stones that flashed the house (curling talk for a different type of bad shot) and losses to teams like South Korea, Denmark and 4 perhaps worst of all 4 the United States, that gold in mixed doubles probably doesn 9t look so shabby. , It should be noted that Canada is a curling powerhouse. Historically speaking, it is a nation of broom-wielding, rock-shoving wizards. Their Olympic trials are [the most competitive curling competition on the planet](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/sports/olympics/canada-curling- brad-gushue.html). Plus, the sport is played on ice, and Canada is pretty good at stuff that involves ice. , Entering these Games, Canadians had never gone without a medal in any curling event since the sport made its debut at the 1998 Winter Olympics. They were 10 for 10, a stretch of dominance that included the last three gold medals in the men 9s competition. , So to do what they did here (or didn 9t do here) would be comparable to the United States men 9s and women 9s basketball teams failing to win a medal at the Summer Olympics. But just as basketball has become a global sport, with improved competition from countries like Spain and Serbia, curling has benefited from increased popularity around the world. , Consider [the success of the South Korean women 9s curling team](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/sports/olympics/garlic-girls-korean- curling.html) at these Olympics 4 and the effect its surprisingly strong showing here will have on the continued growth of the game in Asia. On Friday, the South Koreans defeated Japan, 8-7, in a semifinal thriller to advance to Sunday 9s gold medal final against Sweden. ,  cIt 9s overplayed that Canada is a favorite, the Canadian curler Marc Kennedy told reporters after the team 9s loss to the Americans in Thursday 9s semifinals. cWe come from a rich history of curling, where we won everything, and that 9s not the way it is anymore. , He added: cAnyone that 9s been watching the grand slams of curling, we 9ve got European teams winning all the time. They spend nine months of the year in Canada training and learning our strategies and using our coaching and using our ice. So this is the new normal. People need to get used to it. , Even if that takes some time. ] ",

The HumanDrive initiative will first simulate a range of conditions, before the car starts its 200-mile (320km) journey in December 2019. The UK wants to get driverless cars on the road by 2021. But it is facing stiff competition from the US and other countries around the world. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark welcomed the project: \"Low-carbon and self-driving vehicles are the future and they are going to drive forward a global revolution in mobility.    \"Trailblazing projects like the HumanDrive project will play a vital role helping us deliver on that ambition.\"  Image copyrightCatapultImage caption The car will have to deal with winding roads as well as other challenging conditions  The project is a collaboration between Groupe Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, Cranfield University and Highways England, among others. Mark Westwood, chief technology officer of the Transport Systems Catapult, which is another partner involved in the project, said: \"UK roads throw up some particular challenges. They are different from American roads, with roundabouts and demanding country lanes. These are really testing environments. \"This project is about advancing the state of the art and trying to do something more demanding. The control system will learn to drive like a human.\" To enable this, a group of competent human drivers will show off their skills in a simulator based at Leeds University and the data will be collated. Data is also being collected from roads around the UK. This will be fed into the machine learning system and driverless cars will begin safety testing and trials on private tracks. Waymo - owned by Google's parent firm Alphabet - has already begun trials of a taxi that has no driver to step in if things go wrong. The firm intends the test, in Arizona, to eventually cover an area the size of Greater London. The division has already carried out 3.5 million miles of other tests on US public roads. And Uber recently struck a deal to buy 24,000 self-driving cars from Volvo and plans to radically expand its current tests in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Most car firms, including Toyota, Nissan, BMW and Ford, also have ambitious timelines to get fully autonomous vehicles on the roads by 2020 or 2021.  ] ",

He said \"hard Brexiteers\" had dragged the Conservatives to the right, while Jeremy Corbyn had moved Labour left. \"I don't believe that the moderate, pro-business, socially liberal, internationalist part of the British people has disappeared,\" he said. He spoke alongside former prime minister Tony Blair who warned of politics based on \"shouting loudest\". The two former political opponents, speaking together at an international education conference, warned of a polarised political culture.     'Re-thinking' the centre The centre ground was where general elections used to be fought and won, Mr Osborne told the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai. The middle ground might have been eroded by the financial crisis and by divisions over Brexit said Mr Osborne. But he argued that it was where many voters still remained. The former chancellor said that Labour would be far ahead in the polls with a more moderate leader. Mr Blair said the culture of \"building bridges\" in politics seemed to have been lost. Instead he warned that party politics reflected the type of polarisation and taking of extreme views found on social media. \"Those of use in the centre are going to have to do a lot of re-thinking,\" said the former Labour leader.  'Eccentric' White House On threats from Russia and the rising economic power of China, Mr Blair warned that \"liberal democracy\" would face growing challenges. He called for the US to be much clearer in its defence of western democratic \"values\". But Mr Osborne said that unity between Western allies had become much more difficult under an \"eccentric\" and \"unpredictable\" Trump administration, with a high turnover of senior staff. \"It is very difficult for America's allies,\" said Mr Osborne. On the diplomatic row with Russia following the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, the former Conservative chancellor said it was important to send out a \"tough response\". But he labelled as \"disgraceful\" the way that the Labour leader appeared to distance himself from the government's claims over Russian involvement. Mr Osborne also revealed another connection with Mr Blair. He said during Mr Blair's time in Downing Street, Mr Osborne used to rehearse Conservative leaders getting ready to face prime ministers' questions in the House of Commons - and in those exchanges Mr Osborne played the part of Mr Blair.  ] ",

The government of the southwest African nation that 9s among the world 9s most economically unequal is in the final leg of consultations on the National Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework that will make it mandatory for white-owned businesses to sell a 25 percent stake to blacks, President Hage Geingob told reporters Tuesday in the capital, Windhoek.  cWe have to address the underlying structural impediments which make it difficult, if not impossible, for Namibians to effectively participate in the economy, Geingob said.     The bill outlines six areas to increase black citizens 9 participation in business, including developing people 9s skills and providing financing for those disadvantaged by inequality to buy stakes in companies. While only about 6 percent of Namibia 9s 2.5 million citizens are white, they own most enterprises. That 9s a legacy of white-minority rule South Africa imposed when it controlled Namibia from World War I to 1990, with black people being disenfranchised and displaced. The Namibia Chamber of Commerce and Industry wants the focus on economic ownership scrapped, saying it will result in capital flight. South Africa has a similar policy; critics say it has failed to redress inequalities because it focuses on increasing black ownership of companies rather than raising education standards to match a skills shortage. Namibia will draw comparative experiences from South Africa, but its legislation will be unique, Geingob said.  ] ",

She said she had refused a \\xa345,000 rise as it still left a \"big gap\" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be \"made equal\". In an [open letter,](http://carriegracie.com/news.html) Ms Gracie said the issue was about \"men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal\".    The BBC has conducted a judge-led audit of the pay of most of its staff, which showed no systemic discrimination, and has commissioned accountancy firm PWC to carry out a separate review of on-air staff, which will be published \"shortly\". A BBC spokesman said: \"The BBC was one of the first to publish a gender pay report showing we are significantly better than the national average.\" Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight, employment lawyer Jennifer Millins, who represents several women taking cases against the corporation, said Ms Gracie's case may \"give some answers\" to other complainants.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05t5n1k.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionCarrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor Up to 200 women at various levels of the BBC have made complaints about pay, according to BBC Women, a group of about 150 broadcasters and producers.

In his first day in the job, Matthew Hancock told MPs that \"brilliant women working at all levels of the BBC deserve better\" and pledged to hold it to account. The BBC says it is an issue it needs \"to resolve swiftly and get right\".

She questioned why BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis had been allowed to talk about gender pay on-air, after tweeting about it, while other female colleagues had not. Earlier, the BBC replaced a presenter on Radio 4's You and Yours programme - citing impartiality issues - after Winifred Robinson tweeted support for Carrie Gracie.  Gracie to give evidence Chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee Maria Miller said the broadcaster needed to \"act and act quickly\". She questioned the success of the BBC's internal review and asked why the EHRC has \"failed to intervene\". BBC director general Tony Hall has been asked to meet the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee to discuss how the broadcaster will address the gender pay gap. [The committee said in a tweet that Carrie Gracie would give evidence](https://twitter.com/CommonsCMS/status/950743518909288448) to MPs on the issue.

The BBC is expected to publish a review of on-air staff salaries at the end of the month and says \"fairness in pay\" is \"vital\" to the corporation. Mr Hall has committed to closing the gap by 2020 but the culture secretary said the government \"will watch closely [and]...hold him to that\". As a publicly funded broadcaster, Mr Hancock said the BBC needed to \"uphold and be a beacon of value and of fairness\". The BBC's recently appointed head of news, Fran Unsworth, said pay equality was a priority for the corporation. \"Pay is an issue that we need to resolve swiftly and get right. The public holds us to higher standards than other organisations. We must hold ourselves to those standards too. \"While a significant number of organisations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing better than many - we need to go further. \" [In October, a report found that men working for the BBC earned 9.3% more than women on average](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41497265) compared with an average differential across the UK of 18%.

Josh Kobza, who has spent the past five years as chief financial officer, is becoming chief technology and development officer, the company said Monday. Kobza, 31, will oversee digital initiatives at the company 9s three restaurant chains, which include Tim Hortons and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. The restaurant industry is racing to make it easier for customers to order food with their phones -- technology that has helped fuel sales at Starbucks Corp. and Domino 9s Pizza Inc. By creating the tech-czar job, Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Officer Daniel Schwartz aims to show that the company is serious about\\xa0updating its operations.     The stakes are high, especially as archrival McDonald 9s Corp. lets more customers order and pay digitally. The technology is seen as a way to speed up orders, improve accuracy and keep diners more loyal.  cWe see how impactful its been -- not just at McDonald 9s -- but across the spectrum, Schwartz, 37, said in an interview.  Buffett 9s Backing Restaurant Brands was created in [late 2014](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-09/tim-hortons- shareholders-approve-sale-of-company-to-burger-king \"Tim Hortons Shareholders Vote to Sell Company to Burger King \\(1\\)\") when Burger King, with backing from Warren Buffett 9s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., bought the Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons and combined the two businesses. The company [bought Popeyes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-21/burger-king-owner- to-buy-popeyes-chicken-chain-for-1-8-billion \"Burger King Owner to Buy Popeyes Chicken for $1.8 Billion \\(2\\)\") last year. Private equity firm 3G Capital controls about 43 percent of the company 9s voting shares, and Bill Ackman 9s Pershing Square Capital Management is its largest shareholder. There is work to do on technology across the chains operated by Restaurant Brands, according to Schwartz. Tim Hortons rolled out a mobile ordering app last year, but Burger King is still catching up. While the burger restaurant has an app, customers aren 9t yet able to pay through it. Digital-ordering kiosks -- flat-screen terminals that let customers choose their food at restaurants -- are another front in the fast-food industry 9s tech war. So far, Burger King is just testing the kiosks in the U.S.     Popeyes, meanwhile, isn 9t currently using a uniform payment system at its more than 2,800 locations -- a key first step that would let the fried-chicken chain pursue more digital upgrades.  cIt 9s clear how important technology is to our sector, Kobza said.  ] ",

Bacow is named the 29th President of Harvard University. He is pictured in Loeb House at Harvard University. (Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard) Lawrence S. Bacow, a longtime academic leader with expertise in environmental policy and higher education, will be the next president of Harvard University. He takes on the role, perhaps the most visible symbol of American higher education, at a time when universities are a lightning rod for cultural debate.  cLarry Bacow is one of the most accomplished, admired, insightful and effective leaders in American higher education, said William F. Lee, senior fellow of the Harvard Corp. and chair of the presidential search committee. cThis is a pivotal moment for higher education 4 one full of extraordinary possibilities to pursue new knowledge, enhance education and serve society, but also a time when the singular value of higher education and university research has too often been challenged and called into doubt. Such a time calls for skillful leadership, strategic thinking, and disciplined execution. Larry will provide just that. Bacow will replace the first woman to hold Harvard 9s presidency, Drew Gilpin Faust, a historian who has led the institution since 2007. [The Harvard Crimson](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/2/12/bacow-to- serve-as-29th/), which first reported the story Sunday afternoon, reported that students and alumni had urged the search committee to consider candidates from underrepresented groups. Bacow, a 66-year-old white man, was initially a member of the search committee and in that role had met with a group of Latino students and alumni to listen to their thoughts about leadership at Harvard, according to the Crimson. Bacow is the Hauser leader-in-residence at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government 9s Center for Public Leadership, after spending a decade as the president of Tufts University. As president of Tufts, Bacow oversaw an ambitious fundraising drive, and spoke out about the Dream Act. cI have seen extraordinarily talented young people who did not make a decision to come to this country on their own, 9 9 he [told the Boston Globe in 2010.](http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/12/11/the_academic_bully_pulpit/) cAnd to say no to them, to say we 9re not going to give you an opportunity to become citizens, just strikes me not only as morally wrong but wrongheaded. His parents were immigrants 4 his father\\xa0was a refugee\\xa0and his mother a survivor of Auschwitz 4 and he has strong belief in the power of education to elevate people 9s lives and opportunities, several people said.  cThe Harvard I have known has always stood for at least three things:\\xa0the pursuit of truth, an unwavering commitment to excellence, and opportunity, Bacow said after being elected to the role by the Harvard Corp. with the consent of the university 9s Board of Overseers. cIn a nation divided, these guiding ideals have never been more important.  cWe should never shy away from nor be apologetic about affirming our commitment to making the world a better place through our teaching and scholarship and our commitment to truth, excellence, and opportunity for all.\\xa0And we should always recognize that, for all of our progress toward realizing these ideals over decades and centuries, there is much more we can learn, more we can contribute, more we can do better. Bacow grew up in Michigan, attended college at MIT and went on to earn three degrees from Harvard, in law and public policy. He spent much of his career at MIT, and his research interests include environmental policy, negotiation, economics, and the intersection of law and public policy. Lee said Bacow cwill bring to the task not only wide experience, deep expertise and an intimate familiarity with Harvard 9s opportunities and challenges, but also a passionate commitment to helping universities, and everyone within them, serve the larger world. He is ideally positioned to hit the ground running and keep Harvard moving ambitiously forward. He will become the 29th president of Harvard on July 1. Last summer, Faust announced she would step down as president. _[[ Harvard University president Drew Gilpin Faust to step down in 2018 ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/06/14/harvard- university-president-drew-gilpin-faust-to-step-down- in-2018/?utm_term=.80894da78be7)]_ L. Rafael Reif, the president of MIT, said, cLarry brings to Harvard a significant wealth of knowledge, breadth, experience and vision in higher education. \\u2026 He has demonstrated throughout his career a deep commitment to the role of higher education as a pathway to opportunity and a better world. Mary Sue Coleman, president of the Association of American Universities, said Bacow had worked with her on a three-year project studying the state of public research universities and called him\\xa0 ca terrific choice for Harvard and for higher education in general. \\u2026 I found him to be a great listener, a thoughtful colleague and smart about higher education. Harvard signifies excellence in academia, she said, so his decisions will have resonance.  cIt 9s a bully pulpit, and\\xa0 a very important bully pulpit, Coleman said. ] ",

      "article": "[ A jolt of a movie, cBlack Panther creates wonder with great flair and feeling partly through something Hollywood rarely dreams of anymore: myth. Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one. Its axis point is the fantastical nation of Wakanda, an African Eden where verdant-green landscapes meet blue-sky science fiction. There, spaceships with undercarriages resembling tribal masks soar over majestic waterfalls, touching down in a story that has far more going for it than branding. , Wakanda is home to Black Panther, a.k.a. [T 9Challa](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/T%27Challa_\\(Earth-616\\)) (Chadwick Boseman), the latest Marvel hero to leap off the comic-book page and into his own movie. Created in 1966 by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art), the original Black Panther 4 a hepcat in a slinky suit with claws and ears 4 debuted alongside the Fantastic Four in an adventure in Wakanda, which is powered by a mystery metal, vibranium. It was a splashy, timely entrance (the revolutionary group that shares his name officially formed that same year), and by the end of his first escapade, the Four had assured T 9Challa cthere 9s no reason for the Black Panther 9s career to come to an end! , In the decades since, Black Panther has undergone a variety of costume alterations and adventures in the comics, some under the direction of the filmmaker Reginald Hudlin and, [more recently, the author Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/movies/ta-nehisi-coates-helps-a -new-panther-leave-its-print.html). To direct the first Panther movie, Marvel tapped Ryan Coogler, who with his last outing, c[Creed](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/movies/review-in-creed- rockys-back-as-a-mentor-not-a-fighter.html), shook the dust off the Rocky series by giving it an African-American champion played by Michael B. Jordan. For cBlack Panther, Mr. Coogler brought back both Mr. Jordan and some former crew members 4 including [Rachel Morrison](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/movies/oscars-cinematographer- first-woman-rachel-morrison.html), the director of photography on his first feature cFruitvale Station 4 continuity that may help account for this movie 9s intimacy and fluidity. , As with all Marvel screen ventures, the story has a lot of moving parts, but in general the results don 9t register as the same-old superhero busywork, the kind that makes for forgettable stories and strenuously overinflated running times. Written by Mr. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, cBlack Panther brings T 9Challa 9s story up to the present, sketches in his past and looks to his future, all while clearing room for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its other unitard-wearing warriors. (Black Panther was first wedged into the forgettable cCaptain America: Civil War. d) The movie also rather too breezily establishes Wakanda as a militaristic monarchy that is nevertheless fair and democratic. , The story initially involves a satisfying if obvious cartoonish villain, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis, having a conspicuously very good time), an underworld arms dealer with a weaponized arm, an Afrikaans sneer and a rampaging cohort that includes Erik Killmonger (Mr. Jordan). As his name announces, Killmonger has, well, issues to go with his striking body ornamentation. The band 9s evildoing ways attract the attention of the Black Panther and an international lawman in the person of a friendly C.I.A. agent (the customarily cuddly Martin Freeman), whose good-guy status is just one reminder that cBlack Panther adheres to at least some dubious Hollywood conventions. , For a while, as the story and the Black Panther veer here and there, jumping from Wakanda to Busan, South Korea, the filmmakers seem as if they 9re simply going to deliver a remix of James Bond with a touch of Spidey shenanigans. The Black Panther even slinks into a swank casino with some backup and before long the place has erupted with the kind of choreographed mayhem that 4 as legs and gowns twirl 4 achieves liftoff. There 9s also the inevitable chaotic car chase that turns Busan into a video game and, dispiritingly, a car commercial, an egregious tie-in that is somewhat alleviated by the amusing image of a woman warrior 9s bare foot putting pedal to the metal. , Flourishes like this (along with an amusingly airborne wig and, later, rampaging rhinos) and the Wakandan backdrop give the action scenes kick and actual personality, but Mr. Coogler 9s directing strengths are more intimate. There are sequences in cBlack Panther that may make you cry because of where they go and what they say, but also because of the sensitivity he brings to them. He makes some savvy story choices too. And so, before Mr. Serkis can steal too many scenes, Mr. Coogler turns his attention to Killmonger and pushes the movie in another direction, away from a white villain wronging black people to black people living their lives. , Part of the movie 9s pleasure and its ethos 4 which wends through its visuals 4 is how it dispenses with familiar either/or divides, including the binary opposition that tends to shape our discourse on race. Life in Wakanda is at once urban and rural, futuristic and traditional, technological and mystical. Spaceships zoom over soaring buildings with thatched tops; a hover train zips over a market with hanging woven baskets. In one of the most striking locales, an open-air throne room is horizontally lined with suspended tree limbs, creating a loose pattern that pointedly blurs the divide between the interior and exterior worlds and is echoed by the fretwork in costumes and other sets. , The rejection of the either/or divide extends to Killmonger, whose emotional, fraught back story gives the movie more heft and real-world friction than any of Marvel 9s other superhero blowouts. Like a lot of adventures, cBlack Panther turns on a familiar father-and-son drama 4 there 9s an assassination, a power vacuum and a somewhat reluctant heir 4 a patrilineal intrigue that is filled in here with intense face-offs involving questions of ancestry, identity, the African diaspora, the new world and the old. One particularly moving narrative thread features Sterling K. Brown, a tremulous, vibrantly sensitive actor who conveys entire chapters of grief. (He could out-weep Juliette Binoche.) , Mr. Jordan is a terrifically charismatic presence and there are times when you wonder if he might have made a better Black Panther. Mr. Boseman 9s magnetism is more slow-burning and his performance is more physically restrained than Mr. Jordan, even deliberate, though he has his splashier, freewheeling moments, including some hand-to-hand grappling. (Wrestling is big in Wakanda, hence a few sexy smackdowns featuring acres of bare skin and jumping muscle.) Like many other Wakandans, he speaks in English with a South African lilt, an accent that vividly summons up Nelson Mandela and suggests that T 9Challa will soon be assuming the role of international diplomat. , It 9s important to the movie 9s politics and myth-building that he is surrounded by a phalanx of women, among them a battalion of women warriors called the Dora Milaje. These aren 9t moviedom 9s irritatingly token strong chicks, the tough babes with sizable biceps and skills but no real roles. For all his father issues, T 9Challa is enveloped by women who cushion him in maternal, military, sisterly and scientific support. A female general (Danai Gurira) stands by his side; his baby sister (a vivacious Letitia Wright) provides gadgets and withering asides \\xe0 la Bond 9s gadget guy. Angela Bassett swans in as the royal mother, while Lupita Nyong 9o, as a spy, makes the case for her own spinoff. , Buoyed by its groovy women and Afrofuturist flourishes, Wakanda itself is finally the movie 9s strength, its rallying cry and state of mind. Early on, a white character carelessly describes it as ca third world country 4 textiles, shepherds, cool outfits. Part of the joke, which the movie wittily engages, is that Wakanda certainly fits that profile except that its shepherds patrol the border with techno-wizardry, and its textiles and costumes dazzle because of the country 9s secret vibranium sauce. More critically, having never been conquered, Wakanda has evaded the historical traumas endured by much of the rest of Africa, freeing it from the ravages of both colonialism and postcolonialism. , Race matters in cBlack Panther and it matters deeply, not in terms of Manichaean good guys and bad but as a means to explore larger human concerns about the past, the present and the uses and abuses of power. That alone makes it more thoughtful about how the world works than a lot of mainstream movies, even if those ideas are interspersed with plenty of comic- book posturing. It wouldn 9t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination, creation and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully. ] ",

      "article": "[ PARIS 4 The French comic book artist Yvan Alagb\\xe9 consistently gets the same question about his work: cWhy do you always draw black people? His interrogative reply is twofold: cHave you ever once asked a white person why he only draws white people? and cIs it not possible for me to draw a black person who is representative of humanity in general? , With his twisted goatee and shaved head, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 cut a shamanistic figure as he calmly surveyed the teeming hordes at the annual Children 9s Books Fair in Montreuil, a suburb just east of Paris. As a co-founder of the comic book publisher Fremok he has been attending the event, where we met at the end of November, every year for the last 17 years. , Though not a children 9s book, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s cYellow Negroes and Other Imaginary Creatures is popular among the world of French comics. It was published in 2012 in France, and has now been translated into English and is being released by New York Review Comics on April 3. The 47 -year-old author began cYellow Negroes more than 20 years ago and has been adding narrative layers to it on and off ever since. It has been [compared to Art Spiegelman 9s cMaus d](http://www.tcj.com/the- cage-stands-as-before-the-comics-of-yvan-alagbe/) by the art historian and comic book critic Matthias Wivel. , Similarities include its long gestation, exclusively black-and-white palette and Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s willingness to tackle social and historical issues in comic book form. cA lot of comic book authors are still stuck in the past and are using the same conventional forms as Herg\\xe9 did in the 1930s, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 said in a recent interview. cThat 9s not a problem per se but it shouldn 9t be at the expense of comic book authors who want to do something that is not conventional. , In cYellow Negroes Mr. Alagb\\xe9 did not use black ink naturalistically but as something more expressionistic. An unclothed black man lying asleep on a bed, for instance, might be left with just an outline as opposed to being shaded so as to emphasize his nakedness. cThat 9s something that even now is quite rare in comic books, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 said. cIn American comic books blacks have tended to be uniformly black. , Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s goal with cYellow Negroes was cto tell stories about people who have been marginalized by society. These range from the travails of undocumented African migrants eking out a living in Paris to the frowned upon relationship of a mixed race couple. The title of Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s book came instinctively to him, but with hindsight he said it speaks of cracial labeling which is actually an absurdity. , Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s own upbringing taught him as much. The son of a white French mother and a black Beninese father, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 was born in France but spent his childhood from 6 to 9-years-old living in Benin. cA yellow negro is someone who has my skin color, he said. cWhen I lived in Benin in a neighborhood where there was a mix of ethnicities I was considered white. When I tell this story in France people are amused because for them I 9m black. , Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s surrogate in the book is Sam, a light-skinned struggling illustrator living in Paris, who narrates his encounters with an assortment of damaged souls. One of those is Mario, a former police officer who hails from Algeria. The character was inspired by a man Mr. Alagb\\xe9 met when he was living with his father in Paris during the 1990s. In the book Mario pathetically tries to buy the affections of a Beninese brother and sister by offering to provide them with working papers. , It gradually emerges that Mario was once part of a brutally repressive auxiliary police force in Paris made up of Algerian Harkis sympathetic to the French occupation of Algeria. He is a haunted, hopeless man. cBut instead of helping him people give him a wide berth as if his problems are contagious, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 said. Any simple-minded sentimentality about immigrants all being in the same boat is entirely absent from cYellow Negroes where everybody is potentially somebody else to exploit. , Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s book reminded its English translator Donald Nicholson- Smith of the American underground comics of the 1970s such as cInner City Romance. cNot in the style but the subject matter which were all about people living on the edge in the middle of the ghetto, Mr. Nicholson-Smith said. The English-language version of cYellow Negroes is part of New York Review Comics 9s drive to unearth foreign gems that have built up a cult following. , The translation feels timely because cYellow Negroes 9 twin themes of undocumented migrant workers and the damaging legacy of European colonialism have not gone away. cRelatively speaking, in France we don 9t let any immigrants in anymore, said Mr. Alagb\\xe9, who provided an illustrated coda to the American version of cYellow Negroes updating its themes. ,  cEurope has become a kind of fortress where misfortunates do not have a place. For me that in itself is a kind of hell, he said. , What has added insult to injury for Mr. Alagb\\xe9 is that in the meantime France has continued to shape its former African colonies in its own image by erasing the past as it sees fit. In cYellow Negroes he reported on a collective of undocumented workers striking in Montreuil who put up a photograph of Thomas Sankara, Burkina Faso 9s revolutionary president from 1983 to 1987, in the window of their headquarters. , Inserting himself into the narrative, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 remarked that when he once looked up Sankara 9s name in France 9s famous Larousse dictionary there was no entry for him. However there was an entry for Blaise Compaor\\xe9 who led the 1987 coup 9\\xe9tat during which Sankara was assassinated. cI thought that was incredibly violent, Mr. Alagb\\xe9 said. cNot only was Sankara assassinated but he was also erased from French history. , Mr. Alagb\\xe9 9s other comic books include 2004 9s cWho Has Known the Fire which stages a hypothetical conversation between Sebastian I, who was king of Portugal during the 16th century, and B\\xe9hanzin, who became king of Dahomey (now Benin) during the 19th century. His interest in history extends to making light of his own fraught upbringing: He based a husband who abandons his wife in cYellow Negroes on his father giving him the name Augustus after the Roman emperor. , Mr. Alagb\\xe9 cited the films of Pier Paolo Passolini and Rainer Werner Fassbinder as key influences on his work. cBoth directors showed the harshness of human relationships where mistrustfulness is ever-present, he said. Their open-mindedness also touches him in a way that some comic book artists struggle to do. cI 9ve chatted with illustrators who have told me that they are so used to drawing white people all the time that when they draw a black person it 9s a problem for them, he said. , Making art for art 9s sake has never interested Mr. Alagb\\xe9 and the sheer quantity of comic books on offer nowadays does not necessarily constitute a golden age for him. cWhat I 9m interested in is work that renders visible what has previously been invisible, he said. cBut you need to look long and hard before that can happen. ] ",

The organizers of Time's Up say the movement to eradicate discrimination in the workplace will have a presence at the Oscars, but there are no plans for a red-carpet dress code. Shonda Rhimes, Ava DuVernay, actresses Laura Dern and Tessa Thompson, producer Katie McGrath and attorney Nina Shaw talked about the movement's progress and next steps with news reporters Thursday.  * [Jennifer Lawrence not sure if she will talk to Ryan Seacrest on Oscars red carpet](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jennifer-lawrence-not-sure-if-she-will-talk-to-ryan-seacrest-on-oscars-red-carpet/)  They stressed that while Time's Up made a [splashy appearance at the Golden Globes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golden-globes-2018-black-gowns-red- carpet/) earlier this year, with most women wearing black and several actresses walking the red carpet with activists, the movement is bigger and broader than awards shows. \"We're trying to build something that's sustainable, lasting and serious,\" DuVernay said Thursday at the meeting at the Sunshine Sachs publicity firm's offices in West Hollywood, California. Time's Up was \"launched on the red carpet, but was never intended to live there,\" Rhimes said. Besides the black dresses at the Globes, Time's Up supporters wore white roses at the Grammy Awards. No such uniformity is planned for the Oscars. Formed after the Harvey Weinstein scandal revealed widespread sexual harassment in Hollywood, Time's Up has grown into an international, multifaceted and multipronged approach to fighting workplace discrimination, organizers said. They outlined the various avenues of the effort at Thursday's news conference. A key element is the legal defense fund, which has amassed $21 million and scores of attorneys to date. In partnership with the National Women's Law Center, the fund connects victims of harassment or discrimination with attorneys, who are either volunteering their services or having their fees underwritten by donations. Since Time's Up was founded about two months ago, it has received some 1,700 requests for legal assistance, said attorney Tina Tchen, a lawyer and former director of the White House Council on Women and Girls. More than 1,200 of those cases have already been referred to attorneys, she said. The movement may have started in Hollywood, but it's become global, Rhimes said, with participation in Kenya, South Korea, Pakistan and Kuwait. From the tech sector to farm workers, women are coming together to demand fair treatment, she said. \"The intention really is that a large portion of our leadership will come from other industries,\" Rhimes said. Representatives for farm, domestic and restaurant workers have been actively involved in the expanding movement, she said. On Friday, Time's Up is announcing its new StoryCorps initiative. StoryCorps is a storytelling collective that invites ordinary people to share tales from their lives, which are eventually uploaded into a Library of Congress collection aimed at fostering greater human understanding. The Time's Up partnership invites women and men to share stories about their lives at work. It's not just about sexual harassment, organizers said, but about illuminating what it takes to create fair and equitable workplaces where people of all races, genders and ethnicities are recognized and valued. It's about seizing on the momentum generated by the outrage over Weinstein and those like him and channeling it toward change. Branches of the Time's Up movement have been meeting regularly since the beginning of the year. Various sectors of the initiative are dealing with men, people of color and people overseas, organizers said. Hollywood men have held their own Time's Up meetings, organizers said, and international outreach continues to grow. No invitation is needed to participate, either, they said. Like all grass- roots movements, it grows with personal interest. \"There's actual work being done,\" DuVernay said. \"It's not just a press opportunity ...

It shows that countries which do not get the most from their best and brightest face big economic costs. The research also suggests that the nature-or-nurture debate is a false dichotomy. Intelligence is highly heritable and perhaps the best predictor of success. But it is far from the only characteristic that matters for future eminence. The study of gifted children goes back at least a century. In 1916 Leta Hollingworth 4a psychologist whose doctorate refuted the idea that women struggled at science because of destabilising menstrual cycles 4began some of the earliest research on children with high IQs. Two decades later she started work at the Speyer School in New York City, one of the first schools with a challenging curriculum for these pupils. Like, really smart IQ tests have attracted furious criticism. Speaking for the sceptics, Christopher Hitchens, a journalist, argued that: cThere is...an unusually high and consistent correlation between the stupidity of a given person and [his] propensity to be impressed by the measurement of IQ. Like any assessment, IQ tests are not perfect. But as Stuart Ritchie of the University of Edinburgh points out in cIntelligence d, researchers in cognitive science agree that general intelligence 4not book-learning but the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly and so on 4is an identifiable and important attribute which can be measured by IQ tests. Just how important is suggested by the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), founded in 1971. Julian Stanley, then a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University, over 25 years recruited 5,000 precocious children, each of whom had intelligence-test scores in early adolescence high enough to gain entry to university. Research into how these children did in adulthood has emerged over the past two decades. Of the SMPY participants who scored among the top 0.5% for their age-group in maths and verbal tests, 30% went on to earn a doctorate, versus 1% of Americans as a whole. These children were also much more likely to have high incomes and to file patents. ![](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print- edition/20180324_IRC147.png) There is variation even among the top scorers (see chart). This runs contrary to the idea, proposed by some psychologists, that there is a ceiling to IQ, after which its influence wanes. Of the top 0.01% of children, 50% went on to earn a PhD, medical or law degree. Findings from studies led by Ian Deary of the University of Edinburgh, meanwhile, undermine the idea that gifted children go on to become disproportionately troubled. There are of course exceptions. But on average having a high IQ as a child is associated with better physical and mental health as an adult. Being moved up a school-year, as many are, tends to do them little harm. SMPY pupils who skipped at least one grade were 60% more likely to file patents than those who did not. Officials often cite the SMPY as the inspiration for the creation in 2014 of two specialist maths schools in England. Based on the Kolmogorov School in Moscow, these schools accept only those pupils who excel in maths at exams at age 16. In January the government said it wanted to open more as part of its cindustrial strategy d, a plan to boost Britain 9s woeful productivity growth. Linking gifted education to economic growth may horrify some people. But it has long seemed like common sense in countries without many natural resources, such as Singapore. Sadly, however, the potential of poor bright children is often wasted. In December Raj Chetty of Stanford University and colleagues published a paper lamenting clost Einsteins d. They found that children who score in the top 5% of standardised tests in the third year of primary school are many times more likely than the other 95% to file patents in later life. But the likelihood is still much greater among smart kids from rich families. Philippe Aghion of the London School of Economics and colleagues found similar results in Finland. Those with high IQs but from poor backgrounds were especially at risk of not fulfilling their potential. That is not only unfair. It also implies that a lot of talent, which could have been harnessed to cure diseases or design better toasters, is being squandered. There are many reasons why poor-but-smart children struggle. Yet gifted schemes have often not helped. When applications are voluntary, they come mostly from rich or pushy parents. In New York City, for example, tutoring companies often charge $200 per hour to help four-year-olds prepare for admissions tests for gifted-education programmes starting in kindergarten. Tutoring may temporarily bump up scores by only a few points, but that can make all the difference. In 2015 70% of pupils admitted to such programmes were white or Asian, though they represent just 30% of the school-age population. It helps when schools test every child, rather than rely on parents to put children forward. In a paper from 2015, economists David Card and Laura Giuliano found that when a school district in Florida introduced universal screening for its gifted-education scheme, admissions increased by 180% among poor children, 130% among Hispanics and 80% for black pupils. (Admissions among white children fell.) Some programmes go further. Miami-Dade, America 9s fourth-largest school district, uses universal screening. It has a lower IQ threshold for poor children or those for whom English is a second language, so long as they show other signs of promise, such as learning English quickly or high scores in other tests. In Miami-Dade 6.9% of black pupils are in the gifted programme, versus 2.4% and 3.6% in Florida as a whole and nationwide respectively. In America 48 out of 50 states have programmes for brainy children, but in the decade before 2013, 24 redefined them, typically ditching the cgifted label in favour of chigh-ability d. Today no state relies on a single IQ score to select students. In his book cUngifted Scott Barry Kaufman of the University of Pennsylvania calls this a chuge change from just 20 years ago d. European countries have seen similar shifts. School districts are also testing for other attributes, including spatial ability (ie, the capacity to generate, manipulate and store visual images). Jonathan Wai, a psychologist, notes that spatial ability as a child is strongly linked to achievement in science and technology in later life. The Finnish study also found this. But it is less correlated with income during childhood than are verbal and mathematical scores. So testing for it gives talented poor children a better chance to shine, says Mr Wai. The power of persistence Other researchers worry, though, that no matter how good the selection process, relying only on measures of intelligence will fail to find children with the potential to excel in adult life. Psychologists such as Mr Kaufman argue that there are many more possible paths to success in adulthood than often assumed, and that education must do more to foster attributes such as passion, determination and creativity. Whether termed cgrit d, ctask-motivation or cconscientiousness d, more psychologists are emphasising the role of persistence. cAs much as talent counts, effort counts twice, writes Angela Duckworth of the University of Pennsylvania, in cGrit d, published in 2016. For Anders Ericsson of Florida State University, deliberate practice over a long period (popularly understood as 10,000 hours) is critical. Such statements are simplistic. But few researchers disagree with the idea that talent requires development, and that should involve promoting hard work as well as intelligence. Gifted programmes from Singapore 9s to England 9s specialist maths schools make it a priority to help children pursue their passion. Robotics prodigies, for example, may be given the opportunity to shadow university students. There is evidence that aspects of gifted education should influence education more broadly. Project Bright Idea, developed at Duke University, saw 10,000 typical nursery and primary-school pupils taught using methods often reserved for brainier kids 4fostering high expectations, complex problem-solving and cultivating meta-cognition (or cthinking about thinking d). Nearly every one of them went on to do much better on tests than similar peers. Some researchers go further. Carol Dweck of Stanford University emphasises children 9s cmindset (the beliefs they have about learning). Children who think they can change their intelligence have a cgrowth mindset d, she says. Those who believe they cannot do much to change their cD grades have a cfixed one. According to Ms Dweck, children who adopt the first mindset quickly start to do better in tests. Teaching methods that draw on Ms Dweck 9s work are now found in schools across Britain and America. The World Bank is running trials of the approach in countries such as Peru. One technique, for example, might see a pupil told to add the word cyet to their statements, as in cI can 9t do long-division 4yet. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that interventions based on growth- mindset are less effective than their hype implies. The study suggests that the effects of interventions drawing on the idea have no effect on the typical student 9s outcomes and at best a small effect on those of poorer students. Other psychologists have struggled to replicate Ms Dweck 9s results. ![](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print- edition/20180324_IRD002_0.jpg) The idea that intelligence is highly malleable also jars with research on its heritability. Studies led by Robert Plomin of King 9s College London suggest that roughly 50% of the variance in IQ scores is due to genetic differences. These findings do not dismiss the role of nurture; hard work and social background matter. But they undermine the idea that supreme intelligence can simply be willed into being. A broader approach to gifted education ensures that more children reach their potential. But the evidence suggests that, so long as they are open to everyone, IQ tests still have a vital role to play. To find lost Einsteins, you have to look for them.

(Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) There is a sharp partisan divide in the United States on, well, everything. It 9s a fill-in-the-blank, really: _There is a sharp partisan divide in the United States on _____________. Put whatever you want in that space and the odds are extremely good that the sentence will be accurate. It 9s not surprising, then, that slotting in chow to prevent the massacre of high school students is no exception. In the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last week, two new polls reveal the extent of that gap. A new [Washington Post-ABC poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/most- americans-say-trump-congress-not-doing-enough-to-stop-mass-shootings-post-abc- poll-finds/2018/02/19/3d0005dc-15af- 11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html?utm_term=.297a5f0b21c2) asked Americans what could and couldn 9t have prevented the attack. One from [Quinnipiac University](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2521) explored a broader universe of questions related to gun issues in general. For example: _There is a sharp partisan divide in the United States on whether more guns makes us safer._ ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qhdRrSlaEKQAN_kGxTLh3uR3Hxc=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DWSIK3KFK42MRIEE5SCEC2CR5U.png)  Most Americans think that an increase in the number of guns in the United States would make America less safe. That includes a majority of independents and 9 in 10 Democrats. This is a central argument for gun rights proponents, echoing the line that it takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun. But over time, Quinnipiac polling has found that the argument for more armed citizens has grown less effective. Two years ago, about as many people said more guns would make the United States less safe as said it would make the\\xa0country more safe. Now, there 9s a 26-percentage-point gulf on the question. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UajhDjf0OOA1KEWy4Su0p3NsAdM=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TD6F5V2NVU4JRL2B4OR46CQJXE.png)  So The Post and ABC asked whether perhaps there should be more armed individuals on campus: specifically, teachers. A majority of Americans said that having armed teachers on campus wouldn 9t have prevented the massacre in Parkland, perhaps because those teachers would probably have only encountered alleged shooter Nikolas Cruz after the incident began. (It wouldn 9t have been a deterrent, clearly. There was an armed guard at the Parkland high school, incidentally, who [never encountered](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/armed-guard-florida-school- encountered-rampaging-gunman-article-1.3822777)\\xa0the shooter during the rampage.) ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x9acrQT6P2O8g89ubEaR_cqTROQ=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/43MZJ4M5A42BTK6EXN6ZYRDINY.png)  Republicans thought it could have helped. Two-thirds of Republicans, though, disagreed with the idea that stricter gun-control laws could have prevented the Parkland shooting, though most Americans thought tougher laws could have. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NzG6cnk4_nRYr75idF081wO4VL0=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EAJQ2ADBGI3O3J3LRG2KJRR5RQ.png)  The argument generally used by gun-control opponents in situations like this is that those looking to murder aren 9t going to adhere to legal mandates about who can and can 9t own a firearm. Republicans do think, though, that having metal detectors at schools to find weapons on students would reduce gun violence, allowing prospective shooters to be screened upon entering the building. It was the most popular solution of three offered by Quinnipiac, edging out arming teachers. A plurality of independents and most Democrats see stricter gun laws as a better solution. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ukAmIHcRk3mZ-Mjrc0i_ncPNh7k=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7X6JJ2JV242LNDAAHXQ54PHGVI.png)  Quinnipiac asked another interesting question, too, which sheds some light on views of mass shootings in the United States. Asked which was a bigger problem, mass killings by Americans or mass killings by foreigners, well over two-thirds of respondents said Americans 4 but nearly half of Republicans said that foreigners posed a bigger threat. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OJDsaa8afOIdzQ5GtC6WVv1E_5c=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FKRVH5REJM3W7PGEHISSQVWABE.png)  _There is a sharp partisan divide in the United States on who poses more of a risk to Americans, citizens or foreigners._ But again, that 9s not really a surprise either. ] ",

It was only a matter of attracting Jann Wenner 9s attention. So I worked very hard on my r\\xe9sum\\xe9. Then I put it in a pink plastic folder, filled the folder with glitter, attached the folder to some balloons and hired a messenger to deliver it. Because there 9s nothing that says cserious investigative journalist like glitter and balloons. , It may surprise you to learn that I didn 9t get that job, nor several others with similarly festive deliveries, one involving feathers. Maybe if I 9d been applying to Jazz Hands magazine, I 9d have had a shot. I realize, in retrospect, that I could have used one or more of the books here: books about getting new jobs, accepting and improving yourself in old ones and learning how to work the system when you don 9t come from a place of privilege. Little of the advice involves feathers. , In his 20s, Mike Lewis had the kind of career his parents could boast about: Our Son, the Venture Capitalist. And he didn 9t hate that life, not at all. It 9s just that all he could think about was becoming a professional squash player, devoting his life to a sport with no real prize money and few big sponsors, where you travel the world, crashing on people 9s couches. Uh. O.K. then! , This dream is one step away from that famous cS.N.L. skit in which [Martin Short and Harry Shearer](http://www.holdoutsports.com/2016/08/snl- synchronized-swimming-olympics.html) decide to ditch everything and become Olympic synchronized swimmers, despite the fact that they don 9t know how to swim. But it _is_ a dream, and it 9s _his,_ and despite the fact that Lewis wasn 9t even a great squash player in college, he decides to go for it. And in **WHEN TO JUMP: If the Job You Have Isn 9t the Life You Want (Holt, $26),** he tells us exactly how he made his move. The unintentional hilarity here is that Lewis 9s bold leap is more of a whir forward on a Segway. I mean, the guy had an inspirational quote and a map of the world taped to his office wall. But maybe that 9s the point: Most of us shouldn 9t jump without a certain amount of body armor in the form of saved money, support from friends and family, and endless self-affirmation. What makes this book fun are the collections of stories from fellow jumpers: P.R. executive to bishop in the Episcopal Church, video-game marketer to inventor of the Lyft Carstache, and so forth. The jumps don 9t have to be unusual to be moving. I got a little choked up over Teresa Marie Williams, who was told by can important adult at her high school that she should rethink her plans to pursue her education because she didn 9t come from ca family that goes to college. She did just that, became a nurse, had a son 4 and then started medical school in her 40s. Take that, Bozo Guidance Counselor. , Incidentally, Mike Lewis made it up to the rank of 112th best squash player in the world, traveled to nearly 50 countries, rode in untold numbers of buses and slept on untold numbers of couches. And was very very happy in what many of us would consider the ninth circle of hell. Cue the [Eurythmics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMFqkcPYcg): Sweet dreams are made of this, and who am I to disagree? , Leah Weiss, Ph.D., teaches a course in compassionate leadership at Stanford 9s business school, and if that sounds a little like [George Carlin 9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6deudS3t7E) list of oxymorons ( cjumbo shrimp, cmilitary intelligence d), never fear: She 9s got the goods. In **HOW WE WORK: Live Your Purpose, Reclaim Your Sanity, and Embrace the Daily Grind (HarperWave, $27.99),** Weiss shows how viewing our careers cas an opportunity to practice mindfulness, purposefulness and compassion will make us better workers and better people. She applies the goals of meditation to the office, not in a csit on a cushion with your mantra and a vanilla candle kind of way but by knowing your own mind and heart. She talks about the three aspirational principles of the Tibetan system called _dampa sum 4_ making your actions good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end. You begin by writing your own mission statement and setting out your core values, continue with cmeta-cognition (understanding how your daily work connects with your personal goals and those of your employer) and end with reflection and a process of ccheck ins to collect feedback from your colleagues and see if you 9re meeting your own expectations. , Weiss 9s approach to greater satisfaction and success at work is steeped in evidence-based science. And it 9s not just philosophical; there 9s plenty of practical advice. Consider, for example, her mental exercise intended to cultivate compassion for an officemate who drives you crazy. This multistep process includes: imagining her outside work, perhaps interacting with her children or taking a walk in the woods; imagining her insecurities, her disappointments; thinking about the people who care for her or a family member who needs her. cCan you imagine meeting her for the first time and enjoying her company? Weiss asks gently. To which I could only answer: cShe wears a MAGA cap and chews with her mouth open, so I still hate her. But thanks for asking! At least Weiss has given readers an approach that might be more help than the tiny voodoo dolls I used to keep for those special someones. , Gary Burnison 9s **LOSE THE R\\xc9SUM\\xc9, LAND THE JOB (Wiley, paper, $30)** is less about compassion in the workplace and more about scaring us straight. Burnison, the chief executive of Korn Ferry International, the world 9s largest executive recruiting firm, dedicates the book to ceveryone who hates his or her job. He doesn 9t mean for readers to actually ditch the r\\xe9sum\\xe9; he wants us to understand what a minor part of the job hunt it actually is, particularly now that so much job hunting is done electronically. Hit a button and you 9ve applied 4 and so have thousands of others, often without giving much thought to their qualifications or where they want to live or, essentially, who they are as workers. (Just because you like foosball doesn 9t mean you 9re temperamentally suited for a start-up.) The point is not cWhat can you do for me? but cWhat can I do for your company? cLose the R\\xe9sum\\xe9 breaks down every aspect of job hunting, explaining what matters and what doesn 9t. Did you know that as many as 25 percent of all applicants are deep-sixed by their dopey social media pages? cIf you 9re not careful, Burnison advises, ominously and accurately, cyou can tweet yourself out of a job. , Much of what 9s here we know instinctively, but it 9s very good to be reminded. cNetworking poorly is worse than not networking at all, Burnison writes, as I flashed back to the gynecologist who, in the midst of examining me, asked if I could take a look at his collection of poems about menopause. We 9ve all been there 4 sometimes in stirrups. , And finally there 9s Stacey Abrams 9s **MINORITY LEADER: How to Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change (Holt, $28, available later this month)** **.** If we don 9t have a slavery apologist and accused child molester in the Senate, we can thank black women voters and those who spearheaded registration drives for people of color in the South. Abrams has been a successful tax attorney, entrepreneur and, not least of all, award- winning romance novelist. But she arrived on the national stage when she became House minority leader of the Georgia General Assembly. This year, if she wins the Democratic primary, she could become the first black female governor in American history. , Abrams calls cMinority Leader a chandbook for outsiders, which means it includes a primer on our country 9s power structure for people more likely to have worked on the manor than to be of the manner born. She also tackles the internal barriers, the cfear and otherness that hold so many back, that keep marginalized people toe-dipping in the system while the privileged cannonball straight in. The second of six children of a cgenteel poor Mississippi family, she abided by her parents 9 ctrinity of education, faith and service. Abrams had one early success after another, yet one question haunted her: cI was really good at being a black woman, compared to other black women. But could I be more than that? , For someone who sneaked into the computer lab at Spelman College to plan the next 40 years of her life on a spreadsheet, the answer was obviously cYes.

She went on to get a teaching qualification and now she's running education courses trying to help adults without qualifications, without jobs and often drained of self-confidence. Maxine is speaking at Mowbray Gardens Library in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where a group is gathering for lessons taught by the Workers Educational Association (WEA), the largest voluntary sector provider of adult education. There are ex-miners here who haven't worked since the pits closed in the 1980s.     Image caption \"We all need respect. Everyone should have a chance,\" says Shane  When Maxine left school in the 1970s, she says working class youngsters were expected to go straight into factories, mines or the steelworks. They didn't need to take exams. \"Maths may as well have been taught in Martian language,\" she says.  'A kind of malaise' But those industries have declined and communities have been left behind. \"There's a kind of malaise that falls over like a blanket. It's really hard to break through,\" says Maxine, who found her own way back into learning through the WEA, where she became a tutor.   There have been endless policy announcements and glossy strategies about improving vocational skills and helping people to retrain. But how does that really translate at the sharp end? It's tough enough for people with qualifications - imagine what it's like without any exams and your only work experience is in jobs that no longer exist. \"We all need respect. Everyone should have a chance,\" says Shane, who is part of the student group.  Image caption \"I felt like a proper lost cause,\" says Laura  He doesn't want anyone looking down their noses at people trying to find work or training for a fresh start. Students talk of feeling \"belittled\" by an often faceless online application process. These are the disenfranchised white, working class. Not working, but at least back in class.  'Communities aren't there any more' At the weekly lesson, they're being taught IT skills that could help them write an application letter, put together a CV or find ways to access information online. It's also about working as a group.  Image caption The classes are run each week in the library in Rotherham  There are repeated comments about the threat of social isolation in areas where there are shrinking numbers of shared places to be together. \"People lived, drank, worked together. But those communities aren't there any more,\" says Maxine. Richard, in his 40s, says he'd been living more or less like a \"recluse\", sometimes struggling with depression and finding it difficult to get out of the house. This WEA class had given him a sense of purpose and friendship, as well as learning. The need for retraining is profound.  North-south divide In Rotherham, 12% of the working-age population have no qualifications - in Surrey it's 4%, in parts of London it's too low to be measured. It's a problem that is markedly worse across the north of England compared with the south.   London represents the other end of the spectrum, with the [highest concentration of graduates anywhere in Europe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37158445). For those who find work in Rotherham, the typical full-time annual salary in the town is about \\xa325,600. The news agenda has been focused on value for money for university students, but it's those without qualifications who are almost twice as likely not to be working.   * [Could you cope with eight different jobs a week?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/43145319)   * [Schools 'must do more to promote construction jobs'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42976991)   * [What do children draw when asked about their future jobs?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-42735095/what-do-children-draw-when-asked-about-their-future-jobs)  The WEA runs 8,000 adult courses per year - with a very different social profile from the debate about university access. Among their students, almost half have no or almost no qualifications, almost 40% live in the most deprived areas, a quarter have health problems and 12% have mental health difficulties. But it's also where education can make the biggest difference.  Image copyrightPAImage caption Miners' strike in south Yorkshire: The industries and communities have disappeared  Research into the impact of WEA courses has shown big improvements in employability and positive benefits for those with mental health conditions. Parents reported being more confident with helping their own children to learn. However, it's an uphill struggle. Inside the library there are three separate adult education courses taking place, but the back windows seem to be pitted with what look like air-rifle impacts. Whether or not that's the cause, it seems an appropriate metaphor for people trying to improve but being assailed from every side.  Parents learning together In York, another WEA group is gathering. This might be an historic, picturesque city, but it's a tourist economy with lots of insecure, low-paid work. Its schools have the lowest level of per pupil funding in England.  Image caption Parents in York are returning to learning themselves through projects in schools  The group here are taking part in a project where parents learn about helping in school and are encouraged to improve their own skills. \"When you've got a child, but you don't have the financial backing, it's very difficult to get training,\" says Annemarie. \"I struggled at school with the academic stuff, my self-esteem was very low. I felt stupid. That's what I told myself. I stopped trying because it felt so hard to try.\" But she says her confidence has been reinvigorated by her return to lessons.

I was shy, this awkward person. I felt like a proper lost cause,\" says Laura, also on the Helping In Schools course. \"I left school when I was 14, I didn't gain any GCSEs. I thought this is me, this is all I have to offer. \"But with this course, I've proved I can still do something. \"Now I feel like I can go on to other things.\"  Image caption Richard says there are many people who have little chance of work and are living like \"recluses\"  Applying for jobs left her filled with a sense of \"not being good enough\". \"You think you're going to be turned down straight away.\" She spent a long time in her flat, not going out. There are many people like her, she says, \"going under the radar\". Now she wants to work with children and is going to study how to help with special educational needs.  Image caption Catherine says it was once much easier to get jobs without qualifications  The students and their tutors say the barriers to learning are often practical. Courses can cost too much or the lack of transport can make them out of reach. Affordable childcare can be the key to returning to learning. Again and again these students mention the need for confidence and to make learning seem less daunting. Another student, Catherine, says it used to be much easier to get jobs without qualifications, but now they need to have exams. \"People can do it if they get help,\" says Laura. \"They throw the tablets at you, but this has helped me more than any medication. \"I feel like my life's been turned around. I want to keep on learning now.\"  ] ",

      "article": "[ ASUNCI\\xd3N, Paraguay 4 When she was a student in Paraguay, teachers forced her to kneel on jagged granules of salt and maize for entire mornings as punishment for speaking her mother tongue, Guaran\\xed, in the classroom. ,  cI had to do it in front of my friends so that they saw in black and white what happens to people who speak the language, said Porfiria Orrego Invernizzi, now 67, and a language activist. , Other students were deprived of food and water for the day, forced to wear diapers to class as a form of humiliation or simply beaten for speaking the indigenous language. Treatment of this sort existed in Paraguayan schools throughout much of the country 9s history, up until the fall of the dictator Alfredo Stroessner, whose 35-year rule ended in 1989. ,  cIt was a question of open persecution, said David Galeano Olivera, the head of the Lyceum of Guaran\\xed Language and Culture, which trains teachers in the language. , Despite its widespread use 4 Paraguay is the only country in the Americas where the majority of the population [speaks a single indigenous language](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay- indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html) 4 Guaran\\xed has long been considered palatable for use on the streets and at home, but unsuitable in the spheres of power. , Yet today, officials and intellectuals in Paraguay are working to promote a positive image of the language, in an effort to make good on the 1992 Constitution 9s aim to put it on equal footing with Spanish. , It has been a slog. Centuries of subjugation made Guaran\\xed a second-class language in the minds of many Paraguayans. , Spanish is the dominant language in government ministries, the courts, the news media, literature, schools and professions. ,  cThere is a stigma, a prejudice, associated with Guaran\\xed, said Ladislaa Alcaraz, the government 9s Minister for Language Policy. cIt is associated with poverty, rurality, ignorance, with people who are illiterate. , An effort to make public education bilingual, however, has met resistance from a surprising group: Parents who were raised speaking Guaran\\xed. , Many still hold negative stereotypes of their language, and have pushed back against their children being taught in Guaran\\xed, with its high-pitched, nasal and guttural sounds. They say that an emphasis on Spanish, or a foreign language, would make their children more competitive in the job market. ,  cParents say: 8At home we speak Guaran\\xed, so in the school they attend, I want them to learn Spanish, 9 said Nancy Ben\\xedtez, a curriculum official at the Ministry of Education. cThey say: 8Let other people 9s kids learn it. But not mine. 9  , The government is hoping to change people 9s perspective on the language by encouraging its use in official circles. , The Ministry of Language Policy, established in 2011, has been tasked with normalizing and promoting the use of Guaran\\xed across the government, including in the Legislature and the courts. Judicial officials are being taught Guaran\\xed, and Paraguayans now have the right to a trial in either Spanish or Guaran\\xed. , The ministry in 2017 set up units in every government department 4 where less than 1 percent of written communication with the public is carried out in the language 4 to train civil servants in Guaran\\xed. ,  cIt 9s a human rights issue, Ms. Alcaraz said. cPeople who use Guaran\\xed deserve to be tended to in Guaran\\xed. , The effort to elevate the standing of Guaran\\xed got a lift in 2014, when the Parliament of Mercosur, the regional trading bloc, adopted it as an official working language. , All this is the slowly unfurling result of a decision to make Paraguay officially bilingual in its post-dictatorship Constitution, which gave Guaran\\xed and Spanish legal parity. The intent was to give a historically marginalized segment of the population access to basic government services, the justice system and medical care. , Speaking only Guaran\\xed cis a significant factor driving inequality, said R. Andrew Nickson, an expert in Paraguayan development policy at the University of Birmingham in Britain. When it comes to having a voice on various issues, monolingual Guaran\\xed speakers, or those who speak only a little Spanish, cfear they will be made fun of, so prefer to keep their heads down and mouths shut, he added. , The majority of those who speak little or no Spanish live in the countryside. One-third of Paraguayans tend to use only Guaran\\xed at home. But this figure doubles to nearly two-thirds if urban areas are excluded. , The push to improve the language 9s image and expand its presence is having a noticeable effect. , Today, a growing number of babies and businesses are being given Guaran\\xed names. Guaran\\xed text can be seen on billboards and signs in Asunci\\xf3n, the capital. Its music is no longer just confined to the folk genre; artists are increasingly recording metal, rock and rap songs in Guaran\\xed. , Online content in Guaran\\xed is also steadily expanding. Vikipet\\xe2, the Guaran\\xed version of Wikipedia, gets 220,000 monthly visitors. ,  cWe are breaking out of the enclosure, said Susy Delgado, who won the 2017 national literature prize for her work in the language. cNot as rapidly as we would like, but we are breaking out. , But efforts to bring Guaran\\xed on an equal footing with Spanish are cswimming against the tide, said Shaw N. Gynan, a linguist at Western Washington University, who has done extensive research on Guaran\\xed. ,  cIt is in danger, he said. cAnd it 9s nothing to do with state policy. , Increasing urbanization, caused by large-scale farming that has pushed people from the countryside, is shrinking the monolingual Guaran\\xed base. , On top of this, the bilingual education program is underfunded and has failed to reach many areas of rural Paraguay, where Guaran\\xed speakers are still schooled in Spanish, leading many to drop out. , Part of the problem is that the Guaran\\xed taught in schools is a formal, and somewhat anachronistic, version compared to the colloquial version spoken on the street. ,  cThere is something artificial in the Guaran\\xed kids learn in school; it isn 9t the Guaran\\xed used on the street, Ms. Benitez said. cIt isn 9t the language a referee uses in a football match. It isn 9t the Guaran\\xed that you 9re going to speak with a salesman. , There is no standardized written form of Guaran\\xed, and there is a fierce debate about what the official version should look like. , The Guaran\\xed Language Academy, established in 2012, is split between those who favor a purer version of the language, replacing words adopted from Spanish with old Guaran\\xed words, and those who believe it should be the heavily Spanish-influenced version, known as Yopar\\xe1, that is spoken on the street. , For at least one group of Paraguayans, knowledge of the language has become a key factor in their performance: politicians. , In the recent past, not speaking Paraguay 9s native language was no barrier to those seeking to gain or stay in power. When he was dictator, Stroessner never made a single address in Guaran\\xed (although his wife spoke the language and he rewarded rural Guaran\\xed-speakers with land for their loyalty to his regime). , But now, voters are encouraged to check if candidates speak the language, and those who do not face mockery on social media. The most recent politician to feel the repercussions was Santiago Pe\\xf1a, a close ally of President Horacio Cartes. , In a result that surprised many, Mr. Pe\\xf1a failed to secure his party 9s nomination to contest the presidential elections in 2018, losing last month in the primary of [the ruling Colorado party](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/world/americas/14paraguay.html) to Mario Abdo. One of the reasons for Mr. Pe\\xf1a 9s downfall was an elitist image painted by his opponents, aided in no small part by his inability to speak Guaran\\xed 4 something Mr. Abdo did not hesitate to point out during the campaign. , Under pressure from the electorate, Mr. Pe\\xf1a took a crash course in the language, but it appeared to have done little to sway voters. ,  cIt wasn 9t like this before, said Maria Gloria Pereira, a policy maker and former head of curriculum at the Ministry of Education. cPoliticians feel this pressure, because they know now that those that don 9t speak the language of the people are far from the people. ] ",

The school system 9s foundation should be knowledge, learning, equality and democratic values where each pupil \"is free to form their own ideas and future,\" the party, which leads a minority government with the Greens, said in a statement. It should give all pupils, regardless of background, gender or religion, a good education and be free from confessional elements, it said. \"In our schools, teachers and principals should make the decisions, not priests or imams,\" Minister for Upper Secondary School and Adult Education and Training Anna Ekstrom said at a press conference in Stockholm.     While Sweden has a long tradition of private schools complementing the public education system, the number of such institutions exploded after the country in the early 1990s required municipalities to provide them with funding. While most of those schools have a general focus, some are specialized in a special pedagogy or language while others focus on a religion such as Christianity or Islam. According to the Social Democrats, that has created more segregation. At the press conference, Sweden 9s Minister for Public Administration Ardalan Shekarabi said the Swedish education system needs to be based on the values and principals in the Swedish constitution. Shekarabi, who grew up with gender-segregated schools with religious influence in Iran, said in the statement that he will \"never accept that the oppression that I and many with me have fled from will find its way into the Swedish education system.\"  ] ",

Jobs in Dundee are most at risk from the rise of robot labour, with Edinburgh and Aberdeen better placed to adapt to the changes ahead, it said. [The Cities Outlook report](http://www.centreforcities.org/event/cities- outlook-2018/) is an annual health-check of city economies and this year highlighted the potential impact of automation and globalisation. It said 1 in 5 posts in Scottish cities could be displaced by 2030. The rise of the robots could even compound Britain's north-south divide, the report warned.    Centre for Cities produces the annual report, which predicts that 3.6 million jobs in total might be made obsolete by 2030 - with retail occupations, customer service roles and warehouse jobs among those most at threat. Of the total 230,000 Scottish jobs at risk, this includes 112,700 jobs in Glasgow, 60,800 in Edinburgh, 35,900 in Aberdeen, and 20,000 in Dundee. Dundee is among the top ten British cities most exposed with Edinburgh and Aberdeen also at risk of job losses.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Retail is an area where automation could take over  Cities Outlook 2018 also examines potential jobs growth in British cities which could result from automation and globalisation over the coming decades: In all Scottish cities, around 9% of existing jobs are in occupations predicted to grow in future. The emergence of new industries will create new jobs which do not currently exist - just as the rise of sectors such as the IT industry did over the past century, it said. In Edinburgh and Aberdeen job losses in some sectors could be offset by an upswing in high-skilled jobs as a result of automation and globalisation. In both cities, more than a third of the jobs predicted to grow are in high skilled private sector occupations, while 29% and 22% are in low skilled private sector roles in Edinburgh and Aberdeen respectively.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Automation is set to be extended in many industries  In contrast, more than a third of the jobs set to grow in Dundee (35%) are in low skilled private sector occupations. In Glasgow, the number of low skilled jobs set to grow (27%) is also higher than the number of high skilled jobs (25%). Commenting on these findings, Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: \"Automation and globalisation will bring huge opportunities to increase prosperity and jobs, but there is also a real risk that many people in Scottish cities will lose out. \"The time to act is now - national and local leaders need to ensure that people in cities across Scotland can share in the benefits these changes could offer. \"That means reforming the education system to give young people the cognitive and interpersonal skills they need to thrive in the future, and improving school standards, especially in places where jobs are most at risk. \"We also need greater investment in lifelong learning and technical education to help adults adapt to the changing labour market, and better retraining for people who lose their jobs because of these changes. \"It's also increasingly clear that a one-size-fits-all approach from central government is inadequate to address the myriad issues that different places face.\"  ] ",

The US says it is cutting the agency's funding because it wants to see reforms and for other countries to contribute more. In her statement announcing the administration's decision, Nauert said the US was looking to see \"revisions in how they operate.\" But UNWRA spokesman Christopher Gunness says \"The US government has consistently commended UNRWA's high impact, transparency and accountability.\" In the meantime, Belgium has stepped in with a $23 million dollar contribution to UNRWA to cover a portion of the funding withheld by the United States.

Amanda Spielman said some community leaders see schools as vehicles to \"indoctrinate impressionable minds\" - with extremist ideology in some cases. Ofsted inspectors are increasingly coming into contact with such extremists, she said. She is asking head teachers to confront those who foster extremist behaviour. It comes after an east London head teacher who tried to stop girls under the age of eight from wearing a hijab in the classroom was subjected to a campaign of abuse.    \"Rather than adopting a passive liberalism that says anything goes, for fear of causing offence, schools leaders should be promoting a muscular liberalism,\" Ms Spielman has said at a conference held by the Church of England in London.   * [Should there be more Muslim state schools?](/news/education-37484358)   * [How the Islamic veil has divided opinion across Europe](/news/world-europe-13038095)  \"That sort of liberalism holds no truck for ideologies that seek to close minds or narrow opportunity. \"Occasionally that will mean taking uncomfortable decisions or having tough conversations. \"It means not assuming that the most conservative voices in a particular faith speak for everyone.\" She added: \"Ofsted inspectors are increasingly brought into contact with those who want to actively pervert the purpose of education. \"Under the pretext of religious belief, they use education institutions, legal and illegal, to narrow young people's horizons, to isolate and segregate, and in the worst cases to indoctrinate impressionable minds with extremist ideology. \"Freedom of belief in the private sphere is paramount, but in our schools it is our responsibility to tackle those who actively undermine fundamental British values or equalities law.\"  'Tough decisions' Ms Spielman has previously criticised practices in supplementary schools and some private faith schools. She was understood to be making the speech in support of head teacher Neena Lall, of St Stephen's state primary in east London, who tried to prevent children under the age of eight from wearing the hijab in class. Generally speaking, Muslim girls, although not all of them, wear the hijab after the age of 10. Ms Lall also tried to stop younger pupils from taking part in Ramadan fasting during school hours.  'Campaign of abuse' This prompted a backlash from some members of the local community and parents, although many parents voiced support for the move. Ms Spielman said: \"School leaders must have the right to set school uniform policies in a way that they see fit, in order to promote cohesion. \"It is a matter of deep regret that this outstanding school has been subject to a campaign of abuse by some elements within the community. \"I want to be absolutely clear - Ofsted will always back heads who take tough decisions in the interests of their pupils.\" Ofsted said Ms Spielman was not targeting the Islamic faith, but all forms of fundamentalism.  'Little temptresses' Dr Zubaida Haque, of the Runnymede Trust, told BBC News head teachers' attempts to ban the wearing of hijabs or other religious items in schools could contradict British values Ofsted was trying to promote, including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. She said that in most cases young girls wore the hijab because they wanted to be like their mothers. It was not an issue of safeguarding and there had been no consultation with Muslim communities, she added. A Department for Education official said: \"Extremism has no place in our society - that's why we changed the law and the requirements on schools so that they have to actively promote the 'fundamental British values' of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and the mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. \"If there are any allegations of schools promoting ideologies or discrimination in the classroom, we will not hesitate to take action.\" Shaista Gohir, who chairs Muslim Women's Network UK, said: \"The rising phenomenon of primary-school-aged girls wearing the hijab is certainly not an issue to trivialise. \"In continuing to defend this practice, what messages are being sent to these girls about their hair and body? \"Are we telling them they are little temptresses if they don't cover up?\" * * *  Analysis by Hannah Richardson By wading into the thorny area of who should and should not wear a hijab, the Ofsted chief inspector may have inadvertently opened an old wound Secular organisations, and in particular schools across Europe, have long grappled with this item of Muslim dress. The veil is unique in that it is viewed as a symbol of multi-culturalism, sexism, coercion, women's liberation and community division all at once. The focus here may be on young children's approach to this special piece of cloth. And the majority of Muslim girls do not adopt the hijab before the age of 10. But is it the role of a head teacher to dictate who should and who should not be allowed to wear such an item? Even if they are in charge of uniform policies. By calling on head teachers to exercise a \"muscular liberalism\" in the face of ultra-conservative forces, she may yet stir up more opposition than she anticipated. * * *  ] ",

It is, for example, often said that charter schools 4 which are publicly funded by privately operated, sometimes by for-profit companies 4 have higher test scores than traditional public schools. That makes little sense given that charter schools are vastly different from each other and from traditional public schools in the way they are created, operated and governed. In fact, there are broad differences among charter schools, some of which can be traced back to the laws in the states in which they are located. Some states have laws that provide some oversight and consequences for failing charters. Other states, not so much. Arizona is one of those cnot so much states. This is a post about what 9s going on in the charter world in Arizona. It was written by Jim Hall, who was in education for more than 30 years, 23 of them as a principal in Arizona. He retired a few years ago and formed the nonprofit Arizonans for Charter School Accountability. **By Jim Hall** The pro-school-choice Center for Educational Reform [ranks Arizona ](https://www.edreform.com/2017/03/national-charter-school-law-rankings- scorecard/)as the state with the fewest regulations and restrictions for charter schools in the country. Arizona has no cap on charter schools and allows charter owners to opt out of procurement requirements and accounting guidelines required of other state agencies. Statutes even mandate that the state auditor general cannot monitor charter schools 4 but the lack of transparency goes much further than that. Charter schools have been allowed for years to systematically submit false and incomplete spending data to the state, making it impossible to detect waste and fraud. Charter owners are only required to submit one document annually that details the expenditure of state funds, the Annual Financial Report. Arizonans for Charter School Accountability compiled the annual financial reports for all Arizona charter holders for 2016-2017 and, after sampling [just 13 reports](http://www.azcsa.org/) (out of 418), found all had significant errors and omissions. The nonprofit Arizonans for Charter School Accountability has found that charter owners routinely omit data and make up spending numbers, making it impossible for state and federal agencies to accurately track charter expenditures. Its research revealed: * Charter schools are required to submit the number and certification of teachers employed on the annual financial report, but 38 charter owners did not report teacher data in 2017 4 many have not reported teacher employment for years. How many charter teachers are in Arizona? How many are certified? No one knows. * One hundred and eighty charter owners out of 418 underreported administrative expenditures on required summaries to the state and to the National Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS). Great Hearts Academies, one of the largest charter chains in Arizona, failed to report millions of dollars in administrative expenses, making it appear it is spending $300 less per pupil on administration. All data reported by Arizona Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Education regarding Arizona charter school spending on administration is inaccurate. * The Superintendent of Public Instruction Annual Report has had systematic errors since 2009 as a result of inaccurate reporting by charter holders and the failure of the Department of Education to either monitor submissions or demand fixes. Data regarding statewide charter per pupil expenditures, numbers of teachers employed or total teacher salaries has been falsely reported to the Arizona legislature for years. * The Arizona Department of Education has disseminated inaccurate charter spending data to the NPEFS since 2012, making any federal reports on Arizona charter spending meaningless. Arizona 9s laissez faire approach to charter regulation is evident in the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools 9 near apology for requiring charters to meet the [expectations of the Financial Framework](https://asbcs.az.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Financial%20Guidance%20Document%20Approved%2010-2017.pdf), last revised in October 2017, which only evaluates the charter as a viable business: > However, the Board is aware of the delicate balance between appropriate oversight and infringement on autonomy. In developing the financial framework, the Board remained conscious of its limited resources to implement the financial framework. The Board was also mindful of its commitment to maintaining current levels of data collection so as not to unnecessarily burden the charter holders with requirements to submit additional information for financial performance rating determinations. There are no mechanisms in place for detecting charter waste and fraud in Arizona. Google cArizona charter school fraud and you will not find a single instance where a charter owner has been held accountable for the misappropriation of public funds in the 21 years that charter schools have been operating in Arizona. The result is $1.5 billion in state funding given to charter schools with no expectation of accountability. The American Leadership Academy (ALA) is an example of what happens in the Wild West when there is no sheriff in town: The ALA is one of the largest charter chains in Arizona, growing from 300 students in 2008 to over 6,000 enrolled in 2017.\\xa0 Year after year, ALA has failed to list any supply expenditures outside of instructional supplies, and for three years ALA did not report any spending at all for plant operations. The space asking for numbers of teachers is often left blank, and administrative expenditures in 2016 were underreported by more than $4 million. And ALA does not submit expenditures for a number of operating programs:  1. ALA posted no revenue from food service programs from 2008 to 2017, yet claims on its application for bonds in 2015 to historically earn $10.10 per pupil in food service profits each year (approximately $55,000 a year). In 2017, ALA did not report income or expenses for food service at all, even though all seven schools offer a lunch program.  2. ALA charges all parents for bus transportation yet has not posted this revenue on its Annual Financial Reports from 2008 to 2017. A 2015 ALA bond application states that ALA earns an average of $44.45 per pupil in transportation fees (approximately $180,000 a year) that is not reported as revenue.  3. ALA charges fees for student participation in activities and athletics, reporting $431,736 in fees for 2017 plus an additional $1 million in other cdonations. The $1.4 million in fees and donations listed as revenue are not accounted for. ALA has extensive sports programs and was 3A State Football Champion in 2016, yet there are no extracurricular or athletic program expenditures reported. There is also the omission of more than $4 million in lease payments in 2015 made to companies owned by ALA founder Glenn Way. (Way has not disclosed any related party transactions to the state charter board.) ALA added the $4 million instead as assets to the company, allowing it to purchase an additional $6 million in land and equipment. Is the ALA committing fraud with these acts? The Department of Education and the state charter board haven 9t publicly said they are aware of any wrongdoing, and the Auditor General is not allowed to look 4 by law. _[Editor 9s note: Answer Sheet is seeking comment from ALA and will post any response.]_ Arizonans for Charter School Accountability has complained to: * The Arizona attorney general, requesting an investigation into the failure of the Arizona Department of Education and the state charter board to provide mechanisms to prevent the misappropriation of public funds, as all state agencies are required to do. * The U.S. Department of Education, for the systematic and continuing failure of the Arizona Department of Education to submit accurate and complete financial data on charter school expenditures for the National Public Education Financial Report, as required by law. * The Federal Bureau of Investigation, requesting an investigation into the fraudulent use of public funds by charter schools as the result of inadequate supervision by Arizona government agencies. * The Internal Revenue Service, alleging that ALA has not submitted accurate and complete 990 forms and has failed to disclose related party transactions of over $6 million annually. * The Arizona Interscholastic Association, requesting a probe into the highly visible sports programs at ALA that apparently are not being funded by school money as required. To many charter supporters, the ideology of free-market school choice trumps accountability, including in Arizona. That means the public has no idea how many charter schools spend their money 4 and in Arizona, there is no move among legislators and policymakers to change that. ] ",

The language on Page 998 of the omnibus spending bill 4 agreed to by congressional negotiators on Wednesday to avoid a government shutdown Friday night 4 says this: > _Provided_ , That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds provided by this Act or provided by previous Appropriations Acts to the Department of Education available for obligation or expenditure in the current fiscal year may be used for any activity relating to implementing a reorganization that decentralizes, reduces the staffing level, or alters the responsibilities, structure, authority, or functionality of the Budget Service of the Department of Education, relative to the organization and operation of the Budget Service as in effect on January 1, 2018. With this language, legislators are essentially accusing DeVos of making structural changes to her budget office 4 part of a major reorganization of the entire department 4 without telling them the details. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro of Connecticut 4 the top Democrat on the\\xa0Appropriations subcommittee\\xa0overseeing the department\\xa0 4 said in a statement: > Through the language in this bill to keep our government funded, Democrats and Republicans are preventing Secretary DeVos from circumventing Congress 9s oversight authority. As elected officials in charge of appropriating taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively, it is essential that Secretary DeVos be transparent about any plans to reorganize the Department of Education. This is especially true for the Budget Service office, which provides invaluable expertise to Congress regarding the formulation and implementation of programs. The Education Department did not respond to queries about the reorganization in the budget office. A department official told staffers last week that he had personally had conversations on Capitol Hill about it. A career staff member of the Education Department recently sent an email to four staffers on the House and Senate appropriations committees warning them that DeVos was reorganizing without providing details to Congress. The email, obtained by The Washington Post, said in part: > I 9m concerned that a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy, and a fear of retaliatory action has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the Department 9s plans for fiscal year 2019. > > Specifically, the Congressional Budget Justifications for Fiscal Year 2019 fail to disclose details of the Department 9s Agency Reform Plan. The attached ED Reform Plan slides were presented to employees in an all-staff meeting on February 14. As you can see in the slide deck, the plan was finalized in late November. This means there was ample time to incorporate relevant details into the Department 9s request to Congress. Education officials say the reorganization is to make the department more efficient, but some people on Capitol Hill and in the Education Department itself say they are concerned that DeVos is seeking to give more control to political appointees and less to career staffers who are experts in their fields. That includes the plan to split the now-centralized Budget Service and send staff members to different sections of the department. One Education Department source, who asked not to be named, said the move would make it harder for career budget staffers to see how money is being spent overall and that it was ill-advised because the budget process works best when it is interconnected in a single office. It would lead to a loss of centralized institutional knowledge that can catch mistakes early in the budgeting process. During a meeting at Education Department headquarters on March 13, officials updated staffers on the overall reorganization. Kent D. Talbert, senior policy adviser to the deputy secretary, was asked by a staff member why details about the organization were not included in the proposed 2019 budget. (Talbert has been delegated the duties of the deputy secretary pending the confirmation of Gen. Mick Zais by the Senate.) Talbert said that he had cpersonally gone to Capitol Hill for discussions about it. The staffer responded: cThat 9s not true. Talbert said: cIt is true. I did. The staffer responded, saying that the staffer was the one who had notified the House and Senate appropriations committees several days earlier, and that cthis was the first they heard about it. Talbert repeated that he had had conversations about this with Congress, and that DeVos herself had done so, as well. Conversations were continuing, he said. The staffer said, cThat 9s not consistent with what I was told. During that same meeting, another staffer asked Talbert what the Office of Management and Budget thought about the plan to break up the department 9s budget office, and his answer suggested that OMB was not exactly on board. Talbert said: cThe short answer is that we had some very good discussions, opinionated discussion all around, and those conversations are continuing to take place. ] ",

      "article": "[  Lansing, Mich. (AP) -- Victims of imprisoned former sports doctor Larry Nassar helped unveil what they described Monday as a sweeping rewrite of Michigan laws related to childhood sexual abuse, saying the changes would ease the ability to stop abuse and bring justice to survivors.  Included in the bipartisan 10-bill package is a proposal to drastically lengthen the time limit for victims of sexual assault to sue. Survivors who were minors at the time of abuse and for whom the two- or three-year statute of limitations has expired generally must file a civil lawsuit by their 19th birthday. Under the legislation, minor victims could sue up until their 48th birthday while those assaulted in adulthood would have 30 years to file a claim.  The measures were unveiled the same day the U.S. Education Department announced a new investigation of Michigan State University, where Nassar was employed for decades and which has been accused of mishandling complaints that enabled him to continue molesting patients under the guise of treatment. He also worked at USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians and is the sport&apos;s governing body.     \"We find ourselves at the top of a list we don&apos;t want to be on, as we rank among the states leading the nation in providing protective environments for predators to thrive and the worst environment for survivors to find justice,\" said Sterling Riethman, 25, a former collegiate diver and Nassar patient who was among more than 250 women and girls who spoke at his recent sentencing hearings.  She was joined Monday at the state Capitol by legislators along with \"sister survivors,\" including 2012 Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Jordyn Wieber; Rachael Denhollander, who alerted The Indianapolis Star to Nassar in 2016; Larissa Boyce, who reported Nassar to Michigan State&apos;s gymnastics coach in 1997; and Amanda Thomashow, whose 2014 complaint against Nassar resulted in the school clearing him.  \"Do everything you can to support and protect these victims and others just like them. Make the necessary decision to ensure that this never happens again,\" said Thomashow, 28, who added that Nassar&apos;s survivors 4 who have sued the university, USA Gymnastics and others 4 \"all deserve the same justice without a timeline for our grief or a deadline for our recovery.\"  Other bills would:      4 add college employees and youth sports coaches, trainers and volunteers to the state&apos;s list of people who must report suspected abuse or neglect to child protective services; and stiffen criminal penalties for those mandatory reporters who fail to act.      4 eliminate or lengthen the statute of limitations for prosecutors to file charges in cases of second- and third-degree sexual misconduct.   4 remove the governmental immunity defense for people and institutions that allow sexual assaults to occur.   4 impose no time limit on victims who sue the state for sexual misconduct that occurred when they were under 18, create harsher penalties for child porn possession and let prosecutors introduce evidence of prior sexual assaults in cases where the victim is an adult.     Michigan State and Twistars, an elite Lansing-area youth gymnastics club where Nassar treated athletes, have argued in court filings that most of Nassar&apos;s accusers waited too long to sue. The university also has asserted immunity from claims made under state law, though interim President John Engler said recently he hopes mediation will result in \"a just resolution\" for the survivors.  The legislation is expected to win quick approval Tuesday from a Senate committee. The full Senate could vote as early as next week before the bills go to the House. Denhollandar called on lawmakers to pass the measures before their summer break.  A lawmaker who helped spearhead the bills, Republican Sen. Margaret O&apos;Brien of Portage, said she is \"very confident\" they will be enacted, crediting Riethman and Denhollander particularly for pushing the policy changes.  Also Monday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced a new Title IX probe of Michigan State, saying investigators will look at \"systemic issues\" with how the school handled reports of sexual violence against Nassar.  \"Every student across every campus should know that I am committed to ensuring all students have access to a learning environment free from sexual misconduct and discrimination and that all institutions that fall short will be held accountable for violations of federal law,\" DeVos said in a statement.  The Education Department already had open inquiries into the school&apos;s compliance with Title IX, the law that requires schools to prevent and respond to reports of sexual violence, and its compliance with requirements about providing campus crime and security information.  The Michigan attorney general&apos;s office, Congress and the NCAA also are investigating.  \"MSU will cooperate fully with this and all investigations,\" said university spokeswoman Heather Swain.  ___  Follow David Eggert on Twitter at <https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00> .

For the first time private and public bodies have been instructed to publish the difference between what their male and female employees earn. But with the final 4 April deadline looming, many of them appear to be holding back until the last minute. Fewer than 4,000 out of 9,000 have so far published the required data. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said firms were now in the \"last chance saloon\" over the issue.    All companies with more than 250 staff must publish the difference between the median hourly pay of men and that of women at their firm by 4 April. Public sector bodies face an earlier deadline of 30 March. The EHRC said it would instigate enforcement action on 9 April, which could lead to legal action and an \"unlimited fine\" set by the courts.   * [Find out the pay gap where you work](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43470827)   * [Why do schools have a massive pay gap?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43460998)   * [What is the gender pay gap?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42918951)  \"The clock is ticking and with just 10 days to go, those who haven't reported really are entering the last chance saloon,\" said Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC. She warned that companies that did not comply should \"be prepared for serious reputational damage\" and \"a very unhappy workforce\". The data published so far indicate divergent picture. A higher pay gap indicates a workplace where men dominate the senior or better paid roles. The gap between men's and women's median hourly pay at a national level is 18.4%. But several companies, including Lloyds, Virgin Money, RBS, and Clydesdale Bank have reported pay gaps in excess of 30%.   In the aviation sector Thomson Airways, TUI, Easyjet and Jet2 published median pay gaps over 45%. Across the industry men dominate well-remunerated pilot roles. The public sector has also thrown up some wide disparities. At least 10 schools and several academy trusts have a median pay gap of more than 50%. MPs have questioned whether the scheme to highlight disparities is working effectively. Next month the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee is launching an inquiry which will examine the issue as well as executive pay as well as the gender pay gap in the private sector. Some law and accountancy firms were criticised for leaving out highly paid partners when calculating their gender pay gaps. Rachel Reeves who chairs the committee said: \"Transparency on gender pay is only the beginning. We need to examine why these pay gaps persist, why within the same sector there may be companies with wildly differing pay-gaps, and what remedies are needed to tackle them.\" The Fawcett Society said that in addition to fairness for staff, employers themselves were losing out by not addressing the issue of gender imbalance in the workplace. \"The gender pay gap represents a productivity gap. It's bad for women who lose out on potential earnings and career opportunities but also bad for businesses who are failing to properly recruit, promote and reward women,\" said Jemima Olchawski, head of policy and insight at the Fawcett Society. She said pay gap reporting should provide firms with an opportunity to understand and address why it was happening at their organisation.

      "article": "[  ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. 4 Democracy in the U.S. is threatened as the country remains segregated along racial lines and child poverty worsens, among other barriers of inequality described in a study released 50 years after the landmark 1968 Kerner Report. The new report blames U.S. policymakers and elected officials, saying they're not doing enough to heed the warning on deepening poverty and inequality that was highlighted by the Kerner Commission five decades ago and it lists areas where the country has seen \"a lack of or reversal of progress.\" \"Racial and ethnic inequality is growing worse. We're resegregating our housing and schools again,\" said former Democratic U.S. Sen. Fred Harris of Oklahoma, a co-editor of the new report and the last surviving member of the original Kerner Commission created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967. \"There are far more people who are poor now than was true 50 years ago. Inequality of income is worse.\" The new [study](http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2495_reg.html), titled \"Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report,\" says the percentage of people living in deep poverty 4 at less than half of the federal poverty level 4 has increased since 1975. About 46 percent of people living in poverty in 2016 were classified as living in deep poverty 4 16 percentage points higher than in 1975. And although there has been progress for Hispanic homeownership since the Kerner Commission issued its report, the homeownership gap has widened for African-Americans, the new study found. Three decades after the Fair Housing Act of 1968 passed, black homeownership rose by almost 6 percentage points. But those gains were wiped out from 2000 to 2015 when black homeownership fell 6 percentage points, the report said. The report blames the black homeownership declines on the disproportionate effect that the subprime mortgage lending crisis had on African-American families.    In addition, gains to end school segregation were reversed because of a lack of court oversight and housing discrimination, the new report said. The court oversight allowed school districts to move away from desegregation plans and housing discrimination forced black and Latino families to move into largely minority neighborhoods. In 1988, for example, about 44 percent of black students went to majority- white schools nationally. Only 20 percent of black students do so today, the report said.\\xa0 The result of these gaps means that people of color and those struggling with poverty are confined to poor areas with inadequate housing, underfunded schools and law enforcement that views those residents with suspicion, the report said. Those facts are bad for the whole country, and communities have a moral responsibility to address them now, said Harris, who now lives in the village of Corrales near Albuquerque. The new report calls on the federal government and states to push for more spending on early childhood education and a $15 national minimum wage by 2024. It also demands more regulatory oversight over lenders to prevent predatory lending, community policing that works with nonprofits in minority neighborhoods and more job training programs in an era of automation and emerging technologies.    \"We have to have a massive outcry against the state of our public policies,\" said the Rev. William J. Barber II, a Goldsboro, North Carolina pastor who is leading a multi-ethnic \"Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival\" next month in multiple states. \"Systemic racism is something we don't talk about. Systemic poverty is something we don't talk about. We need to now.\" The late President Johnson formed the original 11-member Kerner Commission as Detroit was engulfed in a raging race riot in 1967. Five days of violence over racial tensions and police violence left 33 blacks and 10 whites dead, and more than 1,400 buildings burned. More than 7,000 people were arrested. That summer, more than 150 cases of civil unrest erupted across the United States. Harris and other commission members toured riot-torn cities and interviewed black and Latino residents and white police officers. The commission recommended that the federal government spend billions to attack structural racism in housing, education and employment. But Johnson, angry that the commission members did not praise his anti-poverty programs, shelved the report and refused to meet with members. Alan Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation and co-editor of the new report, said this study's attention to systemic racism should be less startling to the nation given the extensive research that now calls the country's discriminatory housing and criminal justice systems into question. Unlike the 1968 findings, the new report includes input from African- Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and women who are scholars and offer their own recommendations. \"The average American thinks we progressed a lot,\" said Kevin Washburn, University of New Mexico law professor and citizen of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma who shared his observations for the report. \"But there are still some places where Native people live primitive lives. They don't have access to things such as good water, electricity and plumbing.\" Like the 1968 report, the new study also criticizes media organizations for their coverage of communities of color, saying they need to diversify and hire more black and Latino journalists. News companies could become desensitized to inequality if they lack diverse newsrooms, and they might not view the issue as urgent or newsworthy, said journalist [Gary Younge](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-be-president-in-a -fact-free-america/), who contributed to the report. \"It turns out that sometimes 'dog bites man' really is the story,\" Younge said. \"And we keep missing it.\"  ] ",

He will replace Justine Greening, who is leaving the government. Ms Greening, the first comprehensive-educated Tory education secretary, refused a switch to the Department for Work and Pensions, the BBC understands. Mr Hinds, a former DWP minister, went to a Catholic grammar school in Altrincham and then studied at the University of Oxford.  School funding The MP for East Hampshire is a former chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility.    Mr Hinds wrote on Twitter that he was \"looking forward to working with the great teachers and lecturers in our schools, colleges and universities giving people the opportunities to make the most of their lives\".  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Justine Greening had turned down a move to the Department for Work and Pensions  The incoming education secretary will face pressures over school funding and decisions about university tuition fees. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said he was disappointed to see Ms Greening's departure. \"She has tried hard to tackle the school funding crisis, without any help from the chancellor or prime minister,\" said Mr Barton. Jules White, a [West Sussex head teacher who co-ordinated letters sent to 2.5 million parents over school funding concerns](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41417313), says too often schools policy has been sidetracked by \"dubious ideological pursuits\" or \"tinkering around the edges\". Mr White said Mr Hinds would have to \"urgently address\" core problems over school funding and teacher shortages.  University challenges The National Association of Head Teachers called for more stability and investment. \"Where budgets are at breaking point and recruitment is still a massive challenge, education does not need more upheaval,\" said NAHT leader Paul Whiteman. School funding proved to be an important doorstep issue in the election - and Ms Greening announced that an [extra \\xa31.3bn of the education department's budget would be moved to schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40634472). The new education secretary also faces big decisions over higher education, including the future of tuition fees and university funding. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised there will be a [major review of how students pay for university](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42143632) \\- after pledges from Labour to young voters that they would scrap tuition fees. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said Mr Hinds had \"assiduously\" raised social mobility since becoming an MP in 2010.  Grammar schools Ms Greening had made [social mobility](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42343540) the focus of her 18 months in office and had built bridges with the teaching profession. But there had been questions about whether her approach aligned with the priorities of 10, Downing Street and whether her schools policy was connecting with the public. The Conservatives' flagship policy of bringing back grammar schools was abandoned in the wake of the election. There was said to be backbench disquiet that the push for more selection had been sidelined - and there will be scrutiny of whether Mr Hinds, a former grammar school boy, will be more sympathetic. Mr Hinds will also have to tackle the delayed decision on whether to change the rules to make it easier for faith groups to open free schools, pledged in the Conservatives' election manifesto. With the focus on Brexit, there was no education legislation in the last Queen's Speech. And the incoming education secretary will be expected to re-energise the Conservatives' plans for schools. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Ms Greening had been \"pushed out\", adding: \"The only rational explanation would be that this is an acknowledgement that the Conservatives have a failed schools policy.\"  ] ",

Walmart's human resources told Tomlinson that she was not permitted to return to work until after she gave birth and that she would need to apply for a formal unpaid leave of absence to avoid losing her job in the long run. That news put her in a precarious financial and emotional state during her pregnancy, an already vulnerable time for most women. \"I had to get help and make do with what I could,\" Tomlinson said of life during her pregnancy. A \"very stressful, very emotional\" time. It was also an angry time. Through a conversation with her doctor and a few follow-up searches on the internet, Tomlinson learned that Walmart's treatment of her wasn't just unkind, it was a form of discrimination. She read stories about women like her, whose employers had failed to make what she and her lawyers consider to be simple accommodations for them during their pregnancies. Some of them had filed or taken part in lawsuits. Some of them had won. She contacted the family rights advocacy group A Better Balance and asked, \"Is this fair? Is this right?\" Tomlinson recalled. A Better Balance has since joined up with two other legal rights groups to file a discrimination [charge against Walmart](https://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/redacted-eeoc- charge-tomlinson-v-walmart/) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tomlinson's behalf. Walmart, which the website [247wallst.com](http://247wallst.com/) found to be the [largest non-government employer](http://247wallst.com/special- report/2017/03/17/largest-employer-in-every-state/) in 22 states, has a history of pregnancy discrimination claims. In 2002, the EEOC found that the company rejected an applicant [because she was pregnant](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-23-02.cfm); Walmart did not respond to a question about the case. In recent years, A Better Balance, working with other legal rights groups, has filed five pregnancy discrimination charges with the EEOC [against Walmart](https://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/pregnant-and-working-at- walmart/), two of which have turned into class-action lawsuits and have been filed in federal court.

Now, I want to push for a change for women in the future,\" said Tomlinson, who is now back working at the distribution center. In a statement provided by Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, the company said \"our pregnancy policy goes well beyond federal and most state laws. ... We take each individual situation seriously and we'll work with our pregnant associates to make sure we provide reasonable accommodations when they are requested.\" In the case of Tomlinson, Hargrove added, there was not \"a job available that met Ms. Tomlinson's requested accommodations\" and concluded that \"We remain open to resolving the matter with her.\" \"It's ridiculous that they could not find a job for Ms. Tomlinson,\" said Elizabeth Gedmark, senior staff attorney and director of the southern office for A Better Balance. \"She was very flexible and willing to move stores. They were able to find work for her colleagues in similar situations, so they, as a huge company, certainly could have for her.\" Gedmark said the EEOC is currently investigating the claims.  Despite legal protections, pregnancy discrimination claims still widespread In 1978, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. This made discrimination based on pregnancy- and childbirth-related medical conditions illegal. In 2008, amendments were made to the Americans with Disabilities Act, requiring employers to provide necessary accommodations to pregnant women with certain pregnancy-related conditions that could qualify as disabilities. In recent years, activists have worked to expand the definition of disability in this context. Now, many pregnancy-related conditions [might qualify](https://hbr.org/2015/03/what-young-vs-ups-means-for-pregnant-workers- and-their-bosses), including things like [nausea, fatigue and even carpal tunnel syndrome](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/pregnancy_factsheet.cfm), but only when it meets the legal definition of an impairment that \"substantially limits a major life activity,\" according to the ADA. Gedmark said Walmart's treatment of Tomlinson was a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act but not of the American with Disabilities Act. \"She needed restrictions to prevent problems before they started,\" she explained. \"She shouldn't have to wait for complications to arise in order to get legal protections. It's an unreasonable requirement of any pregnant woman woman and her health.\" [![Women who marched, one year later: &39;We are exhausted but we&39;re here and we&39;re still marching&39;](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)![Women who marched, one year later: &39;We are exhausted but we&39;re here and we&39;re still marching&39;](//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170123100348 -womens-march-washington-large-169.jpg)](/2018/01/19/health/women-march-one- year-later/index.html) [Women who marched, one year later: 'We are exhausted but we're here and we're still marching'](/2018/01/19/health/women-march-one-year-later/index.html) There's also been a movement among states to pass laws granting pregnant employees the [right to reasonable accommodations](https://nwlc.org/resources /pregnancy-accommodations-states/) while on the job. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have such laws, 17 of which were passed in the past five years, according to the National Women's Law Center. Despite these advances, pregnancy discrimination remains widespread. Between 2010 and 2015, nearly [31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges were filed](http://www.afscmeinfocenter.org/blog/2016/10/by-the-numbers-women- continue-to-face-pregnancy-discrimination-in-the-workplace-an-analysis-of-u-s -equal-employment-opportunity-commission-charges-fiscal- years-2011-2015.htm.WnIvpkvasvo) with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. In 2017, [$15 million in settlements were paid out](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/pregnancy_new.cfm) for pregnancy discrimination charges filed with the EEOC, a similar figure to the amount paid in previous years. Research from 2014 shows that beyond the 31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges, a far larger number of [women were denied requests for simple accommodations](http://www.nationalpartnership.org/news- room/press-releases/expecting-and-new-mothers-face-avoidable-challenges-in- the-workplace-survey.html) such as more frequent breaks, time off for prenatal visits or less physically demanding duties. Women from all economic classes are subject to such pregnancy discrimination, but low-income women tend to pay a higher price. This is particularly the case for the many working class women who perform physically demanding jobs, which can often require more accommodations during pregnancy. When these accommodations aren't met, these women can face a difficult choice. On one hand, they have to consider their livelihood. Only [6% of low-wage workers have access to paid maternity leave](http://paidleave.us/issue), and they need the money they make while pregnant to help them take a few unpaid weeks or months off to take care of their babies. On the other hand, they need to consider their, and their fetuses', well- being. Working in physically and emotionally stressful conditions can i[ncrease the likelihood of pregnancy complications](https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/stress-and- pregnancy.aspx), according to the March of Dimes. For black and Latina women, both of whom [make up a large percentage of workers](https://nwlc.org/resources/accommodating-pregnancy-job-stakes-women- color-and-immigrant-women/) in a number of physically demanding and low-wage jobs, the consequences can be severe. Black women are three to four times [more likely to die from pregnancy complications](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth /pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm) than white women, and Latina women experience [higher rates of preterm birth](https://www.marchofdimes.org/Peristats/pdflib/991/MOD_2014HispanicReport.pdf) than white women, which can lead to a number of health complications for their babies.  Laws and culture still make women unwelcome in the workplace Even as they've expanded in recent years, the [laws protecting pregnant women](https://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/pregnant-worker-fairness- legislative-successes/) at work are patchwork and continue to leave out a lot of women, Gedmark said. Discriminating against pregnant women is clearly illegal. But whether a business has to accommodate pregnant women, by giving them a stool to sit on or allowing them more water breaks, remains unclear. Different states have different standards for what kinds of accommodations pregnant workers are legally entitled to receive. Furthermore, the definition of what can be considered a pregnancy-related disability, and therefore requires accommodations, remains elusive among lawmakers on the federal level, as well as in states that lack clear protections. The passing of the [Pregnant Workers Fairness Act](https://www.abetterbalance.org/our-campaigns/pregnant-workers-fairness/), proposed federal legislation first introduced in 2012, would help eliminate some of this confusion, Gedmark said. \"It would add a lot of clarity. Instead of this web of laws, there would be a very clear standard,\" Gedmark explained. \"If a pregnant woman needs an accommodation and the company can accommodate her, absent any undue hardship, they have to. Ultimately, this would be best for workers and best for companies, who would avoid turnover costs.\" [![Sen.

Tammy Duckworth is pregnant; would be first senator to give birth in office](/2018/01/23/politics/tammy-duckworth-pregnant-first-senator- congress/index.html) But unfortunately, passing the law isn't enough. Routine, and illegal, discrimination and failure to accommodate pregnant women has persisted even with existing protections and will continue until the culture surrounding women at work changes. \"It's amazing what people are still doing, despite the fact that pregnancy discrimination has been illegal for decades,\" said Joan Williams, founding director of the Center for Work-Life Law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. \"One of the things that has become clear to me in reading all these pregnancy discrimination cases over the years is employers, in these blue-collar jobs ... didn't really want these gals working for them in the first place. So they wait until they get pregnant and force them to leave.\" Although, according to Williams, no research has been done on the link between sexual harassment and pregnancy and maternal discrimination, she says both stem from the same chronic, and epidemic, hostility to women's bodies in the workplace. By simply having a job, a woman's biology can easily become a liability, to her supervisors and colleagues and, ultimately, herself. \"When a man has to leave work due, say, to severe nausea incident to chemotherapy, it is something the employer has to live with: It's seen as the cost of hiring human beings. If a woman has to leave work, say, due to severe nausea incident to pregnancy, she is seen as demanding special treatment,\" Williams said. \"Men are still the measure of what is seen as the inevitable cost of hiring human beings. Anything related to women alone is seen as somehow extra.\" Join the conversation on CNN Parenting's Facebook page See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Parenting on[ Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cnnparents/). Much of the debate surrounding sexual harassment focuses on the gray areas, pointing out how hard it is to prove the difference between harmless flirting and an abuse of power. While an important point, this critique has the potential to distract us from the larger problem at hand. This is the failure, by many, to see a woman at work and viscerally and intellectually understand that she is there to do her job. It's why women are sexually harassed at work, it's why women are discriminated against for being pregnant at work, and it's what needs to change. ] ",

Today there are more than 10,000. As universities continue to displace apprenticeships and the armed forces as the main path to adulthood in the rich world, scrutiny of higher education has increased. In England critics see universities as hotbeds of anti-Brexit provocation and places where censorious students stifle debate. Complaints about hefty fees and lacklustre teaching are common. David Willetts, Britain 9s higher education minister in the Conservative- Liberal Democrat coalition and now a Tory peer, argues against those who say the answer is to turn the clock back by cutting student numbers. cA University Education is not the mix of gossip and _post hoc_ justification normally churned out by former ministers. Instead, Lord Willetts provides something more valuable: an examination of the state of English universities, a defence of the value of a university education and an argument that the provision of higher education should be expanded further. This may seem curiously egalitarian stuff for a former Conservative minister. Yet Lord Willetts views a university education as akin to home ownership 4both are good for society and something that every parent hopes their child will grow up to possess. He cites evidence that graduates are healthier, happier and less inclined to a life of crime. He notes that the graduate wage premium has held up even as the number of students has grown. Attempts by graduates to restrict access to university, he writes, are little more than ceducational Nimbyism d. As a minister Lord Willetts was best known for nearly trebling tuition fees to \\xa39,000 ($14,000) a year in 2012. Some worried that this would dissuade poor pupils from applying. However, thanks to generous government loans, their numbers continued to grow. In policy circles, the debate has moved on to whether the new arrivals benefit from university study, which is often in less research-orientated institutions, or whether the money would be better spent on other forms of education. Here Lord Willetts is no less trenchant. He argues that these institutions, which tend to languish near the bottom of research-focused league tables, simply perform a different role. They may produce few bankers, judges or Nobel prizewinners, but that reflects their intake, rather than poor tuition. They often add as much value as more prestigious institutions. A recent analysis of graduate salaries by _The Economist_ reached a similar conclusion. Yet Lord Willetts is far from Panglossian. He traces many flaws in England 9s system to the gates of its grandest universities, Oxford and Cambridge. In a brisk history, he tells how, even as the university flourished in Europe, its spread was halted in England by protective measures put in place at the behest of Oxbridge. It was not until the creation of University College London in 1829 that England gained its third university, six centuries after the second. Oxbridge still provides the metric by which other English universities are judged. This leads to excellent research and strong protection of institutional autonomy. It also means universities draw their students from across the country, control their own admissions procedures and compete for the best students. Partly as a result, getting into a prestigious university just about guarantees the student a good job, since mere entry is proof of academic ability. Students thus may have less incentive to work hard, writes Lord Willetts, which allows universities to focus on research. And since universities have so much sway over admissions, the school-leaving curriculum has been narrowed to meet their specialised needs. A reader may wish for a more thorough investigation of potential solutions to these problems. But cA University Education is nevertheless an admirably clear analysis of English higher education. To its credit, it is an inversion of most writing about English universities, which tends to be laudatory of the Oxbridge model and unduly sceptical of others. Lord Willetts 9s book is all the more interesting for it. This article appeared in the Books and arts section of the print edition under the headline \"Three years and score\" ] ",

      "article": "[  cNo means no began to give way to cyes means yes as the credo of sexual consent decades ago, but the shift has been swiftly propelled in recent years by [legislation](http://endrapeoncampus.org/yes-means-yes/) and, most recently, by the [MeToo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/the- metoo-moment-whats-next.html) and [TimesUp](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/movies/times-up-hollywood-women- sexual-harassment.html) movements. , The concept of affirmative consent 4 the act of giving verbal permission clearly and often during intimate encounters 4 was [pioneered at Antioch College](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/style/antioch-college-sexual- offense-prevention-policy.html), where an affirmative sexual consent policy was instituted in 1990. It was [widely mocked](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/11/opinion/ask-first-at-antioch.html) then, but similar policies have since spread to campuses nationwide, and today, the concept is acknowledged well beyond university grounds. , Now, apps aiming to help partners mitigate confusion in the bedroom have emerged, the newest of which approaches consent like a legal contract. [LegalFling](https://legalfling.io/iq-home), which was introduced to users in beta on Monday, lets users give explicit sexual consent via an agreement, or a clive contract, a dynamic document that users can continuously interact with and update. , And yes, these agreements could hold up in court, said [Andrew D. Cherkasky](http://www.bestmilitarydefense.com/biographies/andrew-cherkasky- biography/), a former special victims prosecutor who now handles dozens of felony-level sexual assault cases each year as a criminal defense attorney. He emphasized, however, that what LegalFling offers are not technically contracts, but documentations of intent, which are legally viable. , LegalFling aims to make the sexual dos and don 9ts explicit in a cfun and clear way, according to its website. , Condom use, bondage, dirty talk, sexting: the app lets users set their boundaries before an encounter 4 boundaries that can be adjusted at any time with a tap and shared with a potential partner. (Sound familiar? Netflix 9s twisted-tech series cBlack Mirror incorporated a similar transaction in its episode c[Hang the DJ](http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/black-mirror-season-4-episode-4-ending- explained.html). d) ,  cA profile update is an event we store on the blockchain and will subsequently update the live contract, Rick Schmitz, a co-creator of LegalFling, recently said. The transaction is encrypted, timestamped and stored. (A blockchain is a collection of digital transactions that are registered in a [sequence of cblocks of data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin- bubble.html).) , Will these apps revolutionize sex? Not likely. As complex human beings with ever-changing desires, we may not fit so neatly into click-and-consent existence portrayed in that cBlack Mirror episode, or envisioned by the app developers. But they are making steps toward addressing a problem that needs solving. , [Dr. Michelle Drouin](http://drmichelledrouin.com/), a leading expert on technology and relationships, said the apps are good at documenting consent, but don 9t account much for fluctuating human emotions. They don 9t necessarily allow for any immediacy of one 9s feelings, she said. , Use of the app chas to be planned, she said, cand it 9s really difficult for us to even know how we feel in the present moment, much less trying to anticipate how we might feel an hour from now. , Mr. Schmitz said that a LegalFling agreement does not override someone changing his or her mind in the moment or being too intoxicated, for example, to consent. The company suggests you withdraw consent via the app at that moment, but, of course, that 9s not always possible. , If encounters leave users feeling violated, Mr. Schmitz said, they should notify the aggressor afterward in a message, and it will be added to the record. , Also possible with a tap: triggering cease-and-desist letters, according to the website. , The creators of LegalFling, part of the blockchain company LegalThings, which digitized regulation for the Dutch government, said they decided to apply their technology to sexual consent when, in December, [Sweden proposed a law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/sweden-to-move-burden-of- proof-in-rape-cases-from-claimant-to-the-accused-explicit-consent) that would require people to get explicit verbal consent before sexual contact. , But [Dr. Drouin](http://drmichelledrouin.com/) is not sold on apps as a solution to a very human problem. The requirement to interact with an app during a sexual encounter is ccompletely unrealistic, she said. ,  cIt would be very awkward within the context of an intimate encounter to be like, 8Wait a second, I 9m changing my mind on the app and also with you, 9 she said. , More important, she said, the app could persuade someone to fulfill acts simply because they agreed to them in advance, or to overcommit in an effort to appear more sexually adventurous. , These digital agreements could certainly be used as evidence of, at the time the button was pushed, what an individual 9s intent or desires were, according to Mr. Cherkasky. cWe already see it all the time in social media or text messages, he said, adding that they would most likely be legally viable in cases globally, as well. , But these agreements do have the potential to be used as a means of protection to an aggressor, he said, especially by a violent and premeditating criminal. It 9s very common in domestic violence cases for an attacker to have a cgreat deal of power over the person and force them to do a number of things, he said. , Even implying that someone doesn 9t have the right to change their mind is a real risk, he said. Though the risk also exists for an accused person, who may have fully gotten consent in the moment even if cthe box wasn 9t checked. ,  cIt turns consent into a joke, a technicality that people think is black and white or can be recorded in a moment of time, he said. , But technology is reflecting a cultural shift in respecting and understanding the idea of consent, he said. , Dr. Drouin agreed: People are now communicating about these incidents in ways that are recordable and admissible in court, she said. cIt 9s no longer 8he said, she said. 9 , While LegalFling is the newest app hoping to address the rising tide of consent awareness, it 9s not the first. [We-Consent](http://we- consent.org/index.php), introduced in 2015 by the nonprofit Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence, was created for students on college campuses to help them adhere to the [implementation of affirmative consent rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/hooking-up-at-an- affirmative-consent-campus-its-complicated.html). , In 2014, [California became the first state](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/us/california-high-schools-sexual- consent-classes.html) to require colleges to use affirmative consent as the standard in disciplinary decisions, which inspired the creation of We-Consent, said Michael Lissack, director of the institute. , We-Consent records a short video of two people stating their affirmative consent, according to the company, and uses facial recognition technology. That recording is encrypted and inaccessible without a legal petition. , There are over 100,000 encrypted files, Mr. Lissack said, but the institute has had only two requests ever to retrieve the videos. In both instances 4 before We-Consent turned in the videos 4 the fact that they were available spurred the cases to settle, Mr. Lissack said. ,  cFrom Day 1, the purpose of the app was to get people who are about do something to discuss what they 9re going to do with one another, he said. , Consent can happen only from discussion, he said, cnot from sending emoji back and forth, nodding your head or signing some weird legal agreement. ] ",

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News) _(Update, clarifying the Federal Register notice)_ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is seeking public comment on a plan to delay the implementation of an Obama-era rule that is intended to prevent schools from unnecessarily pushing minority students into special education. The Education Department published a note in the Federal Register on Tuesday that says it wants to delay for two years the rule that was intended to be implemented starting in the 2018-2019 school year. The department did not respond to a query about why it was doing this, but the notice says that it is doing it to make sure that the rule 9s ceffectiveness can be ensured. The Hill newspaper had reported recently that states, districts, superintendents and others had raised concerns about the rule. Administrators have expressed concern about the cost of implementation, while advocates for students with disabilities have said it is an important step to protect minority children. This is one of a number of Obama-era regulations and rules that DeVos has rolled back or delayed, and it is possible that DeVos could decide to eliminate it altogether. For example, her first major policy act was to support a decision by President Trump to rescind the previous administration 9s guidance protecting the right of transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. She also changed Obama 9s guidance on how schools should investigate sexual assault allegations, a move that survivors\\xa0said undermined them. And the department rescinded 72 policy documents detailing the rights of students with disabilities that it said were outdated or repetitive. The Obama administration set what is called the csignificant disproportionality rule after a 2013 report by the U.S. General Accountability Office found that only 2 percent of states had reported that students of color were overrepresented in special-education programs. Such an accounting was required in the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the federal K-12 law addressing special education. President Barack Obama 9s Education Department finalized the rule in late 2016, noting that African American and American Indian youth are identified by schools as having disabilities at rates higher than their peers and that minority students with disabilities were disciplined and removed from regular- education classes at higher rates than their peers. Congress required districts to collect and report data on the demographics and treatment of special-education students, but they were allowed to use their own collection methods. The rule attempts to standardize the way districts identify and then serve minority students with disabilities. Here 9s what the department is doing now: ] ",

Unlike several other finalists, the region offered no tax or other incentives. But Mr. Tory said he believed that the area had two important virtues. , One is Canada 9s immigration policy. Mr. Tory said that when he was recently in New York, he found a great deal of interest among American executives in Canada 9s relatively new immigration program that [gives](https://www.canadavisa.com/global-talent-stream.html)[ visas to certain skilled workers within two weeks](https://www.canadavisa.com/global- talent-stream.html). That 9s light speed compared with the complicated American system. And unlike the United States, Canada does not limit how many of those visas can be issued each year. , In sharp contrast to President Trump 9s efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately Muslim countries into the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that Canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds. ,  cWe 9re able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world, Mr. Tory said. , Toronto 9s second asset, he said, is its publicly funded university and college system. The University of Waterloo has long been recognized as one of North America 9s top technology schools, and the University of Toronto is a major center for research in artificial intelligence. As part of the area 9s Amazon pitch, the province of Ontario has [increased funding](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/amazon-google-ontario-toronto- technology-stem-1.4360106) for artificial intelligence programs at its universities by 30 million Canadian dollars, or about $24 million. ,  cWe have a talent pool, and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full, Mr. Tory said. , But the Toronto area also has a potentially unattractive feature: ever- escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate. Its bid proposes several potential sites for Amazon 9s second headquarters, among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the Google-related redevelopment plan. , Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, Ontario, which is already home to operations of IBM and the chip maker AMD, dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be a deal breaker. He noted that several other finalists, including New York, had similar or higher costs. , Soon after the announcement, Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, appointed Ed Clark, the former president and chief executive of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, to coordinate the province 9s reply. , Mr. Tory said the cities would probably have to wait for Amazon 9s next move before taking any action of their own. ,  cWe don 9t know what they 9re expecting from us, he said. cThere has been no playbook or playoff schedule supplied to the 20 finalists. ] ",

      "article": "[  Last April, Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the College for All Act, which would eliminate tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities for students from families that earn up to $125,000 per year. It would also make community college tuition-free for everyone. Good idea or bad? Advocates of lowering the barriers to college say doing so helps both the students and the U.S. economy. Sanders, one of 21 co-sponsors of the bill in the Senate and House, noted that Germany, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden already have tuition-free public colleges and universities. The U.S. must do the same, he said in a statement, cif we are to succeed in a highly competitive global economy and have the best-educated workforce in the world. The evidence of the benefits of a higher education seems indisputable: People with a bachelor 9s degree earn 73 percent more than those with a high school diploma on average, up from a 50 percent advantage in the late 1970s. It stands to reason that, as computers and robots get more powerful, humans will have to be more educated to master them.     On the other hand, anyone who 9s been to college has to have [some qualms](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-30/free-college-would- help-the-rich-more-than-the-poor) about its value. Anatomy is essential if you 9re going to be a doctor, and history if you plan to teach Western civ. But most of us don 9t need to understand the Krebs cycle or the Peloponnesian War. Honestly, how much do you remember, let alone use, from Spanish or chem or calculus? For many students, college is mostly about jumping through hoops on command to show potential employers you 9re ready, willing, and able to jump through hoops on command. High school isn 9t much different. As somebody named @bdylan234 tweeted on Jan. 11, cI feel like my entire high school education but especially math was like 8ok, pretend that Google doesn 9t exist: how would you do x? 9\\u200a    > I feel like my entire high school education but especially in math was like \"ok, pretend that Google doesn&apos;t exist: how would you do x?\" > > 4 Gabe (@bdylan234) [January 11, 2018](https://twitter.com/bdylan234/status/951284046168055808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)   A forthcoming book by economist Bryan Caplan takes whatever misgivings you had about education and cranks the amplifier up to 11. You probably won 9t agree with everything he says in _The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_ , but his broadside is worth considering carefully given that the U.S. spends $1 trillion or so a year on education at all levels, more than the budget for defense. Caplan is a big deal in libertarian circles. In 2007 he wrote a book called _The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies_. The writer Michael Lind, in a 2014 piece for _Salon_ , said, cEven though I disagree with him, Caplan may turn out to be one of the most significant thinkers of our time. Caplan 9s new book is tenaciously argued and thoroughly documented, with 42 pages of notes and 44 pages of references. Kindergarten is when Caplan began to sense that something was wrong with education. By junior high, he writes, he learned to game the system, cworking as little as possible to get A 9s in all the classes I deemed boring and useless. Whatever tricks he picked up seem to have worked. He earned a bachelor 9s degree from the University of California at Berkeley, a Ph.D. from Princeton, and a tenured job as a professor at George Mason University.     The standard economics case for education is that it builds chuman capital 4skills, knowledge, and habits that are valuable in the workplace. More human capital benefits both the student and the economy. But Caplan argues that human capital isn 9t the main story. He concedes that everybody needs to learn to read, write, and do basic math, but says most of what people learn in high school and college is unnecessary and quickly forgotten. On the international level, he cites studies finding no correlation between a country 9s education level and its national income, holding other factors equal.     What, then, explains such a fat premium for people with college degrees? One possibility is that people who get degrees tend to be more capable and would earn more even without going to college. Another reason 4the one Caplan focuses on 4is that the diploma conveys useful information to employers who can 9t afford to probe each job applicant in depth. It tells them that the prospect, in addition to being reasonably intelligent, is willing to slog through four years of arduous and often boring classes and knows how to fit in. Notice that this signal has nothing to do with what he or she may have learned. The signal to employers 4of diligence, persistence, and conformity 4is just as strong whether the applicant studies Sanskrit or cement mixing. Notice, too, that signaling is a zero-sum game. Earning a college degree sends a message to employers only if other people don 9t have college degrees. If everyone gets a bachelor 9s, you need to earn a master 9s or a doctorate to stand out, even if the job doesn 9t require one. This rat race leads to overeducation and the devaluation of credentials. (High school really was considered high in the past.) Lots of economists and even educators are willing to admit that signaling is part of why degree holders earn more. Caplan estimates it accounts for fully four-fifths of a degree 9s value, leaving just one-fifth for human capital. He doesn 9t stop there: Likening education to a useless toenail fungus cream, he favors cutting way back on public funding for it. In a December interview about the book with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, Caplan said that only about 5 percent of Americans should go to a four-year college. The rest would do better learning a useful trade in vocational education. cBy temperament, he writes in the book, cI am an extremist.     Michael Spence, Kenneth Arrow, Joseph Stiglitz, Thomas Schelling, and Edmund Phelps, all Nobel laureates in economics, have contributed to the theory of signaling over the past half-century. But most scholars haven 9t been willing to follow the theory to its logical conclusion, Caplan says. People who criticize today 9s system get stomped, he writes. cEducation 9s like John Gotti, the legendary 8Teflon Don 9: guilty as sin, but everyone 9s petrified to testify against it. Even strong believers in public education find some points of agreement with Caplan. Linda Galipeau, chief executive officer of staffing provider [Randstad North America](/quote/0003157D:US), says credentialism is a problem for lots of job prospects. cTheir first interview today is with an algorithm. They 9re getting shut out by a robot. A study in October by Harvard Business School and others found that in 2015, 67 percent of production- supervisor job postings asked for a college degree, even though only 16 percent of employed production supervisors had one. cWe 9ve trundled into an over-academicized form of higher education, says economist Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the deputy prime minister of Singapore. I talked to Andrew Cohn, director of a poignant 2016 documentary, _Night School_ , about the struggles of low-income adults in Indianapolis to complete their high school degrees. Many stumbled on algebra, which they would never need in their career. cYou 9re having large swaths of people dropping out because they 9re not able to get through these barriers, Cohn says. Some colleges of the City University of New York are experimenting with alternatives to conventional math because it 9s a ckilling field for many students, Chancellor James Milliken says. Caplan 9s solution 4slashing public support for public education 4is what 9s problematic. He argues that if subsidies were taken away, poor youths who couldn 9t afford college would be unharmed, because employers would begin to view a diploma as a signal of family money, not brains. Maybe. But those strivers would also be deprived of the human capital that college builds 4which even Caplan estimates at a fifth of the value of a degree and some other economists say is substantially higher. In a 2015 column for the Hechinger Report, an education website, Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, writes that the clich\\xe9 ccollege isn 9t for everyone is code for cthose people aren 9t smart enough for college. Caplan is right that higher education consumes too much time and money for too little benefit. But the system needs to change in a way that would narrow society 9s gaps, not widen them.

      "article": "[  President [Donald Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1252249 \"Billionaire Profile\") 9s wall is no longer the biggest divide between Democrats and Republicans on immigration. The potential deal-breaker may be the status of mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters of immigrants. Trump and Republican hard-liners in Congress are demanding that any agreement resolving the legal status of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children must end the ability of citizens to sponsor siblings, parents or adult children for a green card, which confers permanent residency and all but assures citizenship over time.\\xa0 In his first State of the Union address, Trump on Tuesday gave only scant mention to the wall but warned of the danger posed by criminals among undocumented immigrants and those who entered the U.S. through a visa lottery system and family sponsorships.      cUnder the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives, he said, drawing some boos from Democrats in the chamber. cUnder our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary 4 not just for our economy, but for our security, and for the future of America. He called it ca down-the-middle compromise.  Democrats React Democrats didn 9t see it that way.  cThe White House agenda is to gut legal immigration in exchange for allowing some of the Dreamers to live here, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois said after Trump 9s speech. cFor those of us who support legal immigration, and that 9s most Democrats and many Republicans, it won 9t fly. The negotiations on immigration between Congress and the White House have overwhelmed debate on most other issues and hindered action on the federal budget and spending. After Democrats used their leverage to hold up votes in the Senate on a temporary government funding bill -- triggering a three-day federal shutdown -- concessions were put on the table.     [Why U.S. Immigration Overhaul Debate Is So Heated: QuickTake](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/quicktake/immigration-path-to- citizenship \"Click for full story\") While Democrats have derided Trump 9s demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, they 9ve largely accepted the idea of more funding for border security -- though the amount is still in question -- including construction of barriers along some portion of the southern frontier. A resolution on that is likely to\\xa0end in border security funding that Trump can sell to his core supporters as a down payment on a wall while Democrats tell their voters it 9s not a real wall. The White House offered legal status for those eligible for coverage under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, as well as giving them a path to citizenship over a 10- to 12-year period. But Trump, as reiterated in his address on Tuesday, wants to close off sponsorship of immigrant parents and siblings by all U.S. citizens, which Republicans call chain migration. Such a policy change would upend a bedrock of U.S. immigration policy since 1965 and drastically cut the number of legal immigrants let into the country.  Green Cards Family-based immigration has accounted for 60 to 70 percent of all green cards in the last decade, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington- based research group. In 2013, for instance, two-thirds of the nearly 1 million green cards granted were on the basis of a family relationship. Trump 9s proposal would cut legal immigration by 44 percent annually, or about half a million, and prevent some 22 million people from being able to immigrate to the U.S. over the next five decades, according to a study released Monday by the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington. Since the White House first announced the framework, the stalemate has resumed. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Trump ally and a sponsor of legislation that would curtail legal immigration, said\\xa0cutting extended- family sponsorships is ca core part of any legalization deal. He and like-minded conservatives say immigration should be based an individual 9s ability to contribute to the economy. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the lead negotiator on immigration for Democrats, said earlier this week that the limit on family migration would represent ca dramatic change and is cone of the most serious problems in the Republican proposal.  Dividing Families  cThe strength of American families has been a pillar of our country for as long as I can remember, said Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. cAnd to limit family reunification and to literally divide families from their children is inconsistent with the values that I thought both parties embraced. Frank Sharry, who runs the pro-immigration group America 9s Voice, said the policy change would represent cradical nativism and cdestroy the cornerstone of our nation 9s immigration history. It 9s not clear how -- or if -- that political divide can be bridged. There are a flurry of competing proposals on the table. Family green cards are limited to spouses and minor children in the Trump administration framework and in legislation led by Republican House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia.  Competing Plans Competing bipartisan plans -- one in the Senate from Durbin and Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and the other the House by a group of representatives who call themselves the Problem Solvers Caucus -- would preserve family-based immigration for American citizens while barring newly legalized cdreamers, as the DACA recipients are called, from sponsoring extended family. House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and cosponsor of the Goodlatte proposal, said limiting extended-family immigration is cvery important to reaching a deal to protect young beneficiaries of the DACA program that Trump has ordered to an end after March 5. The policy change would accomplish much of what Cotton and Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia set out to do in the RAISE Act, which they advertised as a plan to cut legal immigration in half, largely by limiting family sponsorships. Trump backed that bill at the time, and is now seeking to include its core provisions in a DACA fix.  Demographic Shifts The 1965 law has contributed to demographic shifts that have led to a fast- growing Hispanic population, which has inflamed the U.S. immigration debate and heightened racial tensions that Trump capitalized on in his 2016 campaign. It 9s a sea change from past immigration debates in 2013 and 2007, when Democrats and Republicans were largely united in favor of legal immigration. A 2013 overhaul that passed the Senate with 68 votes and stalled in the House would have narrowly limited family-based immigration -- it banned U.S. citizens from sponsoring siblings and restricted sponsorship of married children to those under 31. The bill also gave a path to citizenship for some 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and substantially expanded merit-based visas. Graham is skeptical whether Democrats will agree to major legal immigration cuts as part of a DACA deal.  cYou can make some changes to chain migration. You can get some of that. The more you give, the more you get, Graham said. Democrats won 9t give the GOP call we want on border, merit-based immigration, and the end of family immigration based on DACA, he said. But that 9s a tough sell for the White House -- and in the Republican-led House, which leans conservative on immigration and refused to allow a vote on Senate-passed bills in 2006 and 2013. Many fear such a scenario could repeat itself, with the Senate expected to bring up an immigration bill by Feb. 8. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, voiced frustration this week with the state of negotiations, tweeting: cOn DACA, both parties seem to want the quid without the quo.  ] ",

But why are poor black Americans so much more optimistic than their white counterparts? America has seen a dramatic increase in the number of so-called \"deaths of despair\". Caused by opioid addiction, alcohol or drug overdose and suicide, these deaths have hit middle-aged white people without a college education particularly hard. The trend is extensive enough to have driven up the overall mortality rate, with the US in the unusual position of being a rich country where [life expectancy is falling rather than going up](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- us-canada-42452733). Amid all this is a perhaps unexpected reality - [the people who are most optimistic about their future are the most disadvantaged: poor black Americans](https://www.brookings.edu/books/happiness-for-all/), who are even slightly more optimistic than rich black people.    And by poor, we mean a household of four earning less than $24,000 (\\xa316,800) per year, which is effectively the official US poverty line. Very different outlooks are revealed when black and white people are asked about their wellbeing. To measure the differences, we use an 11-point scale, where 0 is desperate and 10 is very optimistic.   On this scale, black people are, on average, 1.1 points higher on the optimism scale than white people are. Black people on average score above 8, while the average for white people is 7. The gap across poor black people and poor white people is even larger, at 1.4 points. That is a significant gulf - greater than the difference between rich and poor people, which is 0.6 points. The average score for rich people is 7.5, while for poor people it is 6.9. The starkest disparity is found in the detail that poor black people are almost three times as likely to be a point higher on the optimism scale than poor white people. And poor black people are half as likely to report experiencing stress the previous day than poor white people.   Desperation, stress and worry are closely [linked to a greater risk of premature death](https://www.brookings.edu/research/unequal-hopes-and-lives- in-the-u-s/), regardless of income or race.   * [Who are the poor Americans?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41930107)   * [The time when America stopped being great](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41826022)   * [Five ways to tackle the opioid epidemic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40479686)   * [Smack in the suburbs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37224075)  People with low levels of optimism and high levels of stress and worry are more likely to die from deaths of despair, or to live in areas with high levels of such deaths. The link is strongest for poor white people without a college education, especially those who live in rural areas.  Image copyrightGetty Images Of course, this relationship can run both ways. Desperation can lead to premature death, but living in an area where many such deaths occur can itself be a potential cause of lack of hope, stress, and worry. The link between optimism and longevity is strong. Among Americans born between 1935 and 1945, those who reported higher levels of optimism as young adults were much more likely to be alive in 2015 than less optimistic people. We found that 86% of pessimists died by 2015, while only 77% of the optimists did. The explanations for these trends are complex, but economics and ambition play a part. For many years, blue-collar white people had some advantages over minorities, but they are now among the most disaffected parts of society and the most vulnerable to deaths of despair.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined considerably in recent decades  Crucially, they are much more likely to report that their lives are worse than those of their parents and, in terms of stable employment and status, that is often the case. In contrast, [black and Hispanic people are more likely to report that their lives are better than their parents' lives](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/opinion/why-are-white-death-rates- rising.html). While disadvantage and discrimination still exist, minorities have been making gradual progress in narrowing gaps with white people in terms of their education, wages, and life expectancy. Some of this is because of concrete gains made by those communities. But much of the improvement is due to the relative decline in the incomes and status of poor white people - [a trend associated with the hollowing-out of blue-collar jobs, which are decreasing in both number and stability](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42581933) at the same time as the market for high-skilled labour continues to prosper and grow. The [health implications](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-17 /extraordinary-stress-and-pessimism-take-a-grim-toll) of this have been particularly serious.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Millions of Americans without medical insurance rely on mobile health clinics  White people without a college education are much more likely to die prematurely of preventable deaths than any other group. They also report more pain, stress, and anger than other parts of society. Another factor appears to be higher levels of resilience among poor minorities. For example, black and Hispanic people [are much less likely than white people to report depression or commit suicide](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00040/full). Some of this may be due to resilience built up over generations of hardship - as seen in many poor countries. Informal safety nets may also play a role - such as the community surrounding black churches and extended Hispanic families. However, this does not mean that poor black people are entirely happy with their situation.  Image copyrightGetty Images Despite reporting high levels of optimism, this group was [much less likely to report feeling safe in their neighbourhoods, or to be satisfied with their financial situations](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20171492&&from=f), than their white counterparts. There are also gaps in what we know about resilience - in particular how optimism varies between different places. For example, after adjusting for differences such as education and employment, the minority groups with the [highest levels of optimism and the lowest levels of stress in the US are in the southern states](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-geography-of-desperation-in- america).    This may seem surprising, as these same places have a historical association with racism and still have extensive poverty and poor health. Yet they also have a strong sense of black culture and community: factors that are difficult to measure but undoubtedly important. It is a picture similar to the strong sense of community and culture that helps explain why Latin Americans report higher levels of happiness than those in regions with comparable or higher incomes. A better understanding of resilience may be as important as a greater insight into the causes of desperation. It might also be that we could learn a great deal from better monitoring of wellbeing and the health of society. Other countries, including the UK, regularly track wellbeing, with life satisfaction, smiling, stress, and a sense of purpose in life all included among annual statistics. Routinely collecting such figures in the US could be a simple first step towards better understanding where things have gone wrong for some parts of society. And why some people are so much more optimistic than others.  _Correction 29 January 2018: An earlier version of this story stated that poor black people were 1.1 points higher on the optimism scale than poor white people.

The Centre for Cities estimates that by 2030 nine areas could lose more than a quarter of jobs to automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Roles in shops, administration and warehouses are the most at risk. The government has said it is committed to helping people secure \"the jobs of tomorrow\" with a national retraining scheme. And it said developing AI could [create a net increase of 80,000 jobs a year ](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664563 /industrial-strategy-white-paper-web-ready-version.pdf)in countries with a population the size of the UK.    The Centre for Cities claims that by 2030 more than three million jobs across Great Britain could be lost as robots and AI technology are used more widely in the workplace. [What is an AI?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-34224406/what-is- artificial-intelligence) [Robot automation will \"take 800 million jobs by 2030\"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42170100) The report predicts towns and cities with a \"lower share of high-skilled jobs\", such as Mansfield, Sunderland and Wakefield, face losing nearly 30% of their current roles. The think tank said sales assistants and cashiers accounted for about one in every six of the jobs at risk in Mansfield, while one in 10 posts at risk were in \"elementary storage\" roles such as warehouses, both of which are predicted to see big changes from robotics and AI. In Sunderland, almost one in five jobs at risk are in retail and one in eight are in customer services.   Areas with more higher-skilled jobs such as Oxford, Cambridge and Reading may also lose up to 15% of their current positions.

He was reassigned to the FBI's human resources office after the discovery of the messages, which, according to copies viewed by CNN, included insults lobbed at politicians on both sides of the aisle. Page was also briefly on Mueller's team before returning to the FBI, but she completed her detail before the special counsel's office was made aware of the texts. In the cover letter, Boyd writes that \"misconfiguration issues related to rollouts, provisioning, and software upgrades that conflicted with the FBI's collection capabilities\" prevented the bureau-issued Samsung 5 cellphones from capturing or storing text messages, and lays out a timeline of the dates when the two officials' phones stopped storing the messages, and when they received new devices without the technical problems.

In addition to the missing texts, Republicans are also seizing on the content of the messages that were turned over Friday. In their statement, Goodlatte, Gowdy and Nunes said that they had met over the weekend to discuss the latest batch of messages and called them \"extremely troubling in terms of when certain key decisions were made by the Department of Justice and the FBI, by whom these decisions were made, and the evident bias exhibited by those in charge of the investigation.\" In one February 2016 exchange between the two disclosed in the recent batch and outlined in Johnson's letter, Page says it is \"unbelievable\" that the 2016 presidential race would come down to Clinton versus Trump. Strzok responds, \"Now the pressure really starts to finish MYE . . . ,\" an apparent reference to \"Midyear Exam\" -- the FBI's internal case name for the Clinton investigation. In another exchange highlighted by Johnson, Strzok bemoans the timing of news that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch had decided to accept the recommendations of career supervisors in the DOJ and FBI on the Clinton email investigation, just days after Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton aboard her plane in Phoenix, Arizona, texting, \"(t)iming looks like hell. Will appear to be choreographed.\" Page eventually texts back, \"And yeah, it's a real profile in couragw (sic), since she knows no charges will be brought.\" A first tranche of messages between the two officials that was released last month ignited a political firestorm and fueled a Republican-led effort to discredit the FBI and Mueller's probe. At FBI and DOJ oversight hearings held shortly after the release of the first messages, Republican congressmen took turns criticizing the agencies for having an alleged bias. Some went as far as to call for the firing of the special counsel. ] ",

Germany is ready to discuss with the European Union in every respect measures to counter the U.S. threat to impose tariffs, according to a government official in Berlin. That flexible approach to protecting Germany 9s export-led industry risks alienating other EU countries including France, which according to a French government official doesn 9t want the bloc to make any concessions. With little more than four weeks until a temporary U.S. moratorium on steel and aluminum tariffs runs out, the EU is still trying to identify a common approach to Trump. At stake is potential disruption to a relationship involving total EU-U.S. trade worth some $640 billion in 2016.     Germany is in favor of any EU deal covering new rules on tariffs for a series of products including cars, machinery, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals, the first official said. That stance is not shared by France, which wants to focus on pressuring China over issues such as subsidies and overcapacity in the steel industry, the second official said.

Trump spoke on Tuesday with both Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, according to separate statements from the White House. He and Merkel cdiscussed joining forces to counter China 9s unfair economic practices and of intellectual property, as well as\\xa0 cleveling the playing field on tariffs, the White House said. Macron reminded Trump that European steel and aluminum exports are not a security threat to the U.S., and that the rules of international trade need to be creinforced to ensure such a level playing field, according to the French president 9s office. While Trump favors bilateral agreements with certain states, Merkel insists on a common EU approach on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, which do not allow for tariffs for individual products and countries to be lowered. Under those rules, members can offer market access to one another that is more preferential than the WTO standard as long as such agreements cover csubstantially all commerce between the parties to the deal. The average European Union tariff on goods imported from around the world is 3 percent, while the average U.S. duty on foreign products is 2.4 percent, according to the WTO.  _ 4 With assistance by Gregory Viscusi, Rainer Buergin, and Jonathan Stearns_  ] ",

The [international media](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018 -northkorea-diplomacy-an/north-korea-heads-for-diplomacy-gold-medal-at- olympics-analysts-idUSKBN1FV0JV) have largely dubbed this diplomatic maneuver a cgold medal success. An official delegation led by [Kim Yo Jong](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/08/who-is-kim- yo-jong-heres-what-we-know-about-the-north-korean- princess/?utm_term=.a69fad333050), Kim Jong Un 9s sister, helped North Korea get what it undoubtedly aimed for: At minimum, the regime has a friendly human face; at best, Pyongyang has driven a wedge between South Korea and the United States, even as the regime finds itself increasingly isolated in a nuclear standoff. Far beyond the network cameras, what would this cone Korea look like, though? A number of [analysts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-impossible- state-north-korea-past-and-future-by-victor- cha/2012/05/18/gIQA2K1MZU_story.html?utm_term=.06930a1f4143) and North Korean [defectors](http://www.newsweek.com/kim-jong-uns-economy-could-totally- collapse-within-year-high-level-north-687104) alike see the collapse of Kim 9s regime as a very real possibility. This Olympics twist in North Korea 9s relations with the outside world highlights a deeper, ongoing conflict over national identity on the divided peninsula 4 one that is sure to shape its future politics. _[[ President Trump talked tough on North Korea in the State of the Union. Here 9s where things stand. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey- cage/wp/2018/01/31/president-trump-talked-tough-on-north-korea-in-the-state- of-the-union-heres-where-things-stand/?utm_term=.df85bdc3aea7)]_ South Korea, already home to some 30,000 defectors from the North, has [prepared](https://piie.com/commentary/testimonies/korean-preparation- national-unification) for reunification for years. The government in Seoul is well aware that radical changes in Pyongyang would probably lead to significant spillover of North Koreans into South Korea. After life in one of the world 9s most isolated and authoritarian regimes, how would North Koreans adapt to living in a democracy? Could they become good democrats who fulfill the roles expected of the democratic citizen? **\\xa0**  New data suggests national identity matters In [new research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east- asian-studies/article/research-note-adapting-to-democracy-identity-and-the- political-development-of-north-korean- defectors/3E80FFD0D5E36CB9E1CF09B09D00D744) based on a survey of North Korean defectors, I asked these defectors whether they feel a sense of responsibility to vote 4 the quintessential role of the democratic citizen. I discovered that national identity 4 specifically, conational identification with South Koreans 4 is an important factor in whether North Koreans feel this democratic duty. Many academics still view Korea as an [ethnically homogeneous nation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/16/a -revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse- countries/?utm_term=.cfe49a4268d1). But when you ask North Koreans who have come over to South Korea, there is a great deal of variation in how much they feel that coneness. Feelings of national belonging matter for how defectors approach democratic citizenship for the first time. In fact, I find that they matter far more than factors like satisfaction with resettlement aid or fair treatment by the state. Strongly identifying with one Korean nation, vs. only weakly, turns out to be the difference between a North Korean who feels a duty to vote vs. one who does not, controlling for key background characteristics. And while the duty to vote is a small sliver of what it means to be a democratic citizen, a healthy democracy depends on this type of political spirit.  The unexpected way national unity helps democracy\\xa0 Why do feelings of national unity matter? Probably not in the way most would expect. In follow-up work based on lengthy interviews with defectors, I find a counterintuitive story. Many North Koreans hold a deeply ingrained script or code of conduct that emphasizes citizen sacrifice and duty to the nation. For North Koreans who see South Koreans as part of that nation, this script 4 a product of authoritarian socialization in the North 4 shifts into a sense of democratic duty in the democratic South. _[[ Yes, North Korea could drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/12/yes-north- korea-could-drive-a-wedge-into-the-u-s-south-korea-alliance-heres-the- problem/?utm_term=.eee25360f11c)]_ Researchers often look at the transition into democracy as the [shedding of the authoritarian past](http://www.jstor.org/stable/422173?seq=1page_scan_tab_contents). In that context, the reality of what helps many North Koreans adapt to South Korean democracy is quite ironic. Yet for the North Koreans telling their stories, this extension of political duty seemed to be quite natural. As one defector said to me: cEven when I lived in the North, I always thought that those who care about the country would do things for it. So now that I live here, I just go and vote. It 9s just uptown and downtown. Underneath, we are all Korean. \\u2026 We are one by blood.  PyeongChang, Pyongyang and the peninsula\\xa0 It isn 9t clear South Koreans would agree. In this light, the real news of the 2018 Winter Olympics is not really North Korea 9s move, but South Korea 9s [deeply divided response](http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la- fg-south-korea-olympics-protest-20180122-story.html). Many South Koreans have warmly, if nervously, welcomed the North Koreans. But some say Seoul has been too accommodating 4 especially at a cost to some of its own athletes. _[[ Why nuclear war with North Korea is less likely than you think ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/03/why-nuclear- war-with-north-korea-is-less-likely-than-you-think/?utm_term=.d327f7e6a795)]_ Protesters held signs that asked: cPyeongChang or Pyongyang Olympics?

Behind the images of North Korean cheerleaders and the united flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics, there is a growing identity divide on the Korean Peninsula 4 and a different kind of cNorth Korea problem. How North and South Koreans come to see each other 4 as one of cus or cthem 4 is going to matter a great deal in whether and how democracy ultimately shakes out on the peninsula.

He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl. In an \"ask me anything\" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering. Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology. Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: \"The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.    \"Right now, crypto-currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and crypto- currencies is super risky for those who go long.\"  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption There are now some high-profile names cautioning against crypto-currency investment  Veteran investor Warren Buffet has previously said that the speculative crypto-currency craze \"will come to a bad end\". Mr Gates has not always been so cynical about Bitcoin. In 2014, in an interview [on Bloomberg TV,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-10-02 /bill-gates-bitcoin-is-exciting-because-its-cheap) he said that Bitcoin \"was better than currency\". His less than enthusiastic response on Reddit did not go down well with all those participating in the debate, with some reproaching him for what they felt was an attempt to influence the market. Others suggested that he needed to look again at the Bitcoin white paper.  Charitable donations In the wide-ranging Reddit chat, Mr Gates told the audience that his top three goals were \"reducing both childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio\". Mr Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which spends billions each year on education and health projects. The foundation has also sponsored the development of blockchain - the technology that underpins crypto-currenices - for merchants in Kenya. Microsoft is also looking to integrate blockchain-based technology for verifying digital identity. The rise in value of crypto-currency has prompted governments around the world to look more closely at its impact on economies and citizens. While the technology underlying it is often praised, there are concerns about how it could disrupt the economy as well as its links to cyber-crime and money laundering. The UK's Treasury Committee is [currently investigating](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43148180) the impact of such currencies.  ] ",

People fear the destructive menace of the Taliban and the Islamic State, but their anger is directed at their own leaders, especially President Ashraf Ghani, who many feel have abandoned them.  cPeople did not suddenly become afraid, but this time the violence has added to their frustrations with the government. It showed a total failure of institutions and leadership, said Haroun Mir, an independent analyst and former government security adviser.\\xa0 Like several observers, Mir said Afghans feel increasingly frustrated with the\\xa0National\\xa0Unity\\xa0Government, which they see as preoccupied with combating domestic political opponents and courting international favor, while many ordinary citizens can 9t find jobs or feel safe walking the streets.  cSecurity has become the privilege of the elite, he said. cThe rest of us are in the hands of God. ![](https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/02/01 /National-Security/Graphics/2300-ARMYUNIT.jpg?uuid=FiLOEAeEEeiqYfM5E3OGfg)  The insurgents have continued to gain far-flung territory and launch devastating urban attacks, even as the U.S. government\\xa0[embarks on a new initiative](http://www.standard.net/World/2017/05/23/U-S-troop-increase-would- aim-to-double-the-size-of-Afghanistan-s-special-operations-unit) to strengthen and expand the Afghan defense forces, bringing in thousands of new U.S. military trainers in close cooperation with Ghani and his security advisers.

The other issue challenging Ghani 9s authority is public fights between the president and current and former officials that have dominated headlines for weeks. Such power struggles, instead of being handled through negotiations, have threatened to politicize intelligence agencies, pit regional strongmen against the central government and potentially divide the national defense forces.  cThese political distractions are becoming more dangerous than the Taliban, said Javid Faisal, a senior aide to the government 9s chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah, who ran against Ghani in 2014 but later agreed to share power with him after a fraud-plagued and inconclusive election. cYou expect the Taliban to act like terrorists, but you don 9t expect friends to behave like enemies. ![](https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/02/09/Foreign/Images/GettyImages-672230608.jpg?uuid=2L1BXA27EeiZjJbesYzKGQ)  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is ensnared in public fights with current and former political figures.

After months of negotiations in which Atta demanded more official perks and power, Ghani abruptly fired him in December. Atta refused to resign, and the president threatened to dislodge him by force until he was dissuaded by the White House.\\xa0 Now, a tense stalemate reigns. Atta remains at his post, and his political party\\xa0 4 which dominates the security forces and backed Abdullah for president\\xa0 4 is vacillating between the two camps.\\xa0 Critics blame Ghani for needlessly humiliating a powerful and vengeful rival whom he could have appeased with blandishments, while his supporters blame Atta 4 who threatened to lead violent protests when Ghani claimed victory in 2014 4 for behaving like a warlord while reaping the benefits of a modern democratic order.\\xa0  cThis situation sucked the energy out of the government for a couple of weeks, but it also indicates that the state is slowly hardening, said the senior aide to Ghani. cThe governor was scared he would lose the wealth and power he had acquired illegally. Only several wrong signals from the United States, the aide said, made Atta feel he could tough things out, but the de facto governor has lost crucial popular support and may now be fatally weakened. The second, newer brouhaha is between Ghani and another high-profile opponent, [Rahmatullah Nabil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/10/afghan-spy- chief-resigns-after-rows-with-president), who quit as head of the national intelligence agency two years ago in a policy dispute with Ghani and since then has co-founded an opposition party. Nabil, who recently accused Ghani of fraudulently manipulating the 2014 election, suddenly was barred from returning to Afghanistan while visiting the United States last month. Since then, officials have denied imposing such a bar, but Nabil has extended his trip abroad, and aides said his plans are not decided. These fights, while providing endless talk show fodder, also have added to concern that Afghan leaders are more worried about undermining each other as potential electoral rivals than about restoring public confidence and strengthening a democratic system that still is floundering badly after 17 years. Many Afghans fear presidential elections will not be held at all by next year, defying the constitution and public demand.\\xa0  cThe government is not sincere about reforms. The elite officials live in fortresses and have families and houses abroad. They don 9t feel what real people do, said Mir, the analyst. The Ghani administration, he charged, is more concerned with placating its Western backers and consolidating power than addressing public concerns. cGhani is trying to divide and rule, when what Afghanistan needs is to be united. It might help him for now, but it could destroy the country.

Tuk- tuks, the motorised rickshaws used across south-east Asia, are delivering textbooks and lessons to remote villages in a scheme known as \"Book Book Tuk- Tuk\". It can be difficult and expensive for students to get an education in rural Cambodia and a school in Takhmau, south of Phnom Penh is experimenting with taking lessons directly to them. Kuma Cambodia, a school founded in 2012 by the Norwegian Association for Private Initiative in Cambodia (NAPIC), decided to dispatch libraries on wheels to remote areas, to bring books to rural children. The Book Book Tuk Tuk project, working with village chiefs to encourage participation, sends out tuk-tuks staffed by Cambodian volunteers, many of whom are just out of school themselves.    They educate families about why it's important to send children to school, as well as addressing social issues such as HIV awareness and concerns about gambling.  'Cycle of poverty' Volunteer Pring Mean, a 21-year-old Cambodian, explained: \"Not letting children go to school is common among the poorest. \"Parents do not understand the value of education, family income is too low and so children need to work or look after young siblings, or parents suffer from drugs or alcohol addiction,\" says Mean.  Image caption Children get a chance to see books from the mobile library and to get help from volunteer staff  \"When children aren't sent to school they're more vulnerable to exploitation and getting involved in drugs or crime. Without access to education they remain in the cycle of poverty.\" The tuk-tuk volunteers teach children maths, how to draw, read, sing, and tell them traditional Cambodian stories. Although the libraries provide access to literature and advice, their primary function is to encourage parents to send their children to school. Seavsean, a 10-year-old Cambodian girl, lived under a plastic sheet with her parents and brother in a rural village in Kandal province. Her father gambled away the family's earnings, leaving her mother to sneak out at night to steal rice to feed her children.  Image caption Bringing books to rural villages helps communities which can miss out on schools  But after participating in the parent programme at Book Book Tuk Tuk, Seavsean's father stopped drinking and got a job. Now, they live in a brick house, and Seavsean attends school at Kuma Cambodia. \"We believe giving parents more knowledge, hope and motivation to help them change their destructive behaviour - like gambling, drug abuse or domestic violence - and break the cycle for their children,\" said Pring Mean. But Book Book Tuk Tuk isn't the only classroom taking to the road to reach children.  Teaching English by video  Image caption Teachers from the US deliver live English lessons on video to learners in Indonesia  In Indonesia, a lack of qualified English language teachers means many students' future employment prospects are limited. Children in low-income, rural areas have little or no access to English language teaching, while unreliable, expensive internet access rules out online learning. So three organisations, Oxford University Press (OUP), car group IndoMobil and US teaching network Eleutian, combined forces to kit out trucks with satellite technology, linking Indonesian students with US-based teachers. The trucks are driven to low-income communities across the country, park somewhere open - such as a playground - and set up. The side of the truck folds away to reveal a large TV screen, with shade from the sun and rain, and students learn from OUP's syllabus from a teacher leading the class in real time from the US. \"English proficiency is becoming increasingly important in developing countries, says OUP's Joseph Noble. \"This is particularly true in Indonesia. However, many students are being left behind.\" Since its inception, the TeachCast project has reached more than a thousand students, and has plans to expand its current fleet of 15 trucks to 500, with each truck teaching 150 students per day. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * ['Counting every school shooting so it never seems normal'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43060002)   * ['Guns and survivalists, but no school until I was 17'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43038598)   * [Researchers examine the mysteries of falling asleep](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42945383)   * [Preventing child brides: 'I was 12 when I married a 35-year-old'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42794898)   * [US and England pull out of Pisa tests on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42781376)   * [UK university plans to access EU funds after Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42690438)   * [Putting university in reach of South Africa's townships](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42572139)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)  The editor of Global education is sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * *  Floating schools In Bangladesh, much of the country is prone to flooding, classrooms on wheels aren't always a viable option. Flooding severely impacts children's education, adding to the country's four million children who are already out of school. \"Schools struggle against floods and riverbank erosion,\" says Mohammed Rezwan, executive director of non-profit organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha. \"The river is known as the 'destroyer of establishments'.  Image caption In Bangladesh, thousands of children learn on floating classrooms  \"Schooling opportunities are already very limited for the extremely poor, and when roads become impassable during the monsoon, students can't trek to school. \"School dropouts are common in these rural regions,\" he says. Rezwan's family owned a small boat, meaning he could attend school during monsoon season, and Rezwan was inspired to create \"floating schools\". \"I thought if children couldn't come to school, then the school should come to them.\"  Image caption The floating schools collect children from stops along the river  The organisation now owns 22 school boats, and educates nearly 2,000 children, who are collected from various riverside villages throughout the day. After the boat docks at its final destination, class begins. Each boat is equipped with solar powered electricity, a laptop, and a classroom for 30 students.

      "article": "[ For people in the English speaking parts of [Cameroon](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/cameroon.html), free speech on the internet has become all but impossible.  Authorities in the country's Anglophone region have blocked access to social media and messaging apps for almost four months in an ongoing attempt to quell criticism aimed against the government.  It is the second internet shutdown within a year in the West African nation.  \"Cameroonians have come to expect internet restrictions when they voice their dissent against the government; they have accepted this has become a way of life,\" Judith Nwana, a US-based Cameroonian human rights activist with a background in telecommunications, told Al Jazeera.  \"When it first happened, we were all taken unaware because we never imagined that this could happen in Cameroon. Then there was the gradual acceptance that the crisis was threatening the government and we were living in an oppressive regime,\" she added.  That first shutdown [happened](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01 /cameroon-anglophone-areas-suffer-internet-blackout-170125174215077.html) in January 2017, after Anglophone teachers, lawyers and students went on strike over alleged bias in favour of Francophones.  The Anglophones [claimed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/cameroon- teachers-lawyers-strike-english-161205095929616.html) they face discrimination and that they were excluded from state jobs as a result of their limited French language skills.   {articleGUID}   \"The Anglophone regions feel neglected and left out of the national government's agenda,\" Peter Micek of digital rights organisation Access Now told Al Jazeera.  \"Then, the government took the extreme measure to shut down the internet completely,\" he said.  The first shutdown lasted 93 days, from January to April 2017.  \"It was devastating. People didn 9t know how to work around it,\" Judith Nwana said, adding that the whole society was affected; education, money transfers, healthcare and businesses all relied on internet access, which was now shutdown.  Eventually, internet access was restored in April after international pressure from, among others, the United Nations and Pope Francis.  However, in October a second, more targeted shutdown was enacted after renewed protests in the Anglophone areas.  The new blockade took aim at social media and messaging apps. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp were all shut down.  But by this time, many Cameroonians were prepared, using VPN services to circumvent the blockade.  \"Unfortunately, VPNs are expensive and not everyone can afford one or had budgeted for one. Regardless, businesses, the tech industry, healthcare and education are seriously affected,\" Nwana said.  One of those affected businesses belongs to Mambe Churchill Nanje, a software engineer and CEO and founder of Njorku, a search engine that allows people all over Africa to look for jobs.  Nanje is based in Silicon Mountain, a tech-hub based and around in the city of Buea, which was hit hard by both shutdowns.  \"They not only affected me and my business, but the whole of Silicon Mountain,\" Nanje told Al Jazeera.  \"It has pushed out a lot of the talent [at Silicon Mountain]. They had to leave because they can't work. They either moved to other parts of Cameroon or out of the country,\" he said.   Internet refugee camp  As the shutdowns continued, many Cameroonians were forced to travel back and forth to regions with internet access to conduct business or access vital information.  \"They came together and formed an internet refugee camp along the border with the littoral region, where others could come and get internet access from the neighbouring region,\" Nwana said.  The first shutdown alone cost the country at least $38m, Nwana added. The effects of the second blockade are not as severe economically, but Nwana emphasised there is more than just monetary loss.  \"Shutting down social media sites is akin to shutting down the internet. It's how people communicate today. Cases have been recorded of people missing deadlines or scholarships and opportunities when the information is put on social media,\" she said.  \"Those in Anglophone Cameroon don 9t get to see this, which reinforces the feeling of marginalisation and discrimination,\" Nwana added.   {articleGUID}   Micek echoed Nwana's sentiment, saying the economic effect is big but also not the only thing that is lost because of these shutdowns.  \"The Silicon Mountain region is a hub of innovation and that has suffered enormously. Besides, the economy is integrated, so getting services from the Silicon Mountain area is gonna be hard, wherever people are in the country, either in the Anglophone or Francophone regions,\" Micek said.  \"And this blockade prevents not just Cameroonians but all of us from accessing businesses, personal stories and other rich content from these areas in Cameroon,\" Micek said.  \"The whole world suffers because of these shutdowns.\" ] ",

      "article": "[  Theresa May set out to repair her image with young voters with a warning over the cost and quality of university courses, and an acknowledgment that students were being failed by a funding system that leaves them with crippling debts. Echoing the tone of her [first public address](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-13/new-u-k-prime- minister-may-pledges-to-build-a-better-britain \"New U.K. Prime Minister May Pledges to Build a Better Britain\") as prime minister in 2016, May called for a system that opens up copportunity for everyone and said the outdated snobbery that favors academic over technical qualifications must end.  cWe need an education and training system which is more flexible and more diverse than it is today, May said in a speech in Derby on Monday to announce a one-year review into university and higher education. cWe must act now to deliver that education system that truly works for everyone.     The reboot comes after a disastrous June election in which her Conservative Party lost its majority, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn 9s pledge to offer free adult education a major draw. University students frequently graduate in the U.K. with debts of 50,000 pounds ($70,000) or more. ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iZuXgYsNe7Uc/v1/60x-1.png) But education politics have also become inextricably linked to the vote to leave the European Union. After the 2016 referendum, there were protests among young people carrying banners reading, cYou Stole My Future, while Brexit also puts in jeopardy U.K. participation in exchange programs and EU funding for scientists and research in Britain. Even on the basic level of EU professors being able to continue working at U.K. universities, there is confusion. May acknowledged the link in her speech.  cThe Britain of the 2020s will be a Britain outside of the European Union, pursuing a new course in the world, May said. cWe need education to be the key that unlocks the door to a better future.     But just as with Brexit, there were already signs of division within May 9s party on Sunday after Education Secretary Damian Hinds said there were various options to tackle costs to attend university, including shorter courses or charging more for math and science degrees than arts and humanities.      cWhat we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing -- the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future, Hinds said on the BBC 9s cThe Andrew Marr Show. That drew criticism from Hinds 9s own predecessor, Justine Greening. The government must avoid a system in which poorer students choose a cheaper degree rather than one cthat will really unlock their potential in future, Greening said on ITV 9s cPeston on Sunday. May implied that the push for universities to vary prices will go ahead, though she also hinted that measures to boost social mobility would be considered, including the reintroduction of government grants for poorer students.  ] ",

(Mark Lennihan/AP) Fewer Republicans say they believe that there is a scientific consensus on climate change or that the effects of global warming have already begun, according to [a new Gallup poll,](http://news.gallup.com/poll/231530/global- warming-concern-steady-despite-partisan- shifts.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=NEWSFEED&g_campaign=item_&g_content=Global%2520Warming%2520Concern%2520Steady%2520Despite%2520Some%2520Partisan%2520Shifts) which showed a widening partisan gap near record levels. The moves comes after a year in which President Trump, who has called global warming a choax, withdrew from the 2015 Paris climate accord and removed climate change from a list of top national security threats. As Republicans moved in one direction, Democrats have moved in the other. An increasing number of Democrats believe that the effects of global warming have already begun and that warming will pose a cserious threat in their lifetimes. As in earlier surveys, an overwhelming portion of Democrats are worried about climate change and link it to human activities. Overall, 45 percent of those surveyed said global warming would pose a serious threat in their lifetimes, the highest overall percentage recorded since Gallup first asked the question in 1997.\\xa0Despite partisan divisions, majorities of Americans as a whole continue to believe by wide margins that most scientists think global warming is taking place, that it is caused by human activities and that its effects have begun. But as it did last year, the Gallup poll painted sharp differences between the two parties. Nine out of 10 Democrats worry about global warming and believe it is caused by human activities. Only a third of Republicans do. Seven in 10 Republicans think the seriousness of global warming is cgenerally exaggerated, while only 1 in 25 Democrats do. Those positions inched further apart over the past year. The divide between the parties grew most markedly on the question of whether the effects of global warming have already begun. Only 34 percent of Republicans agreed with that, down from 41 percent in early 2017. Meanwhile, 82 percent of Democrats agreed with that, up from 73 percent a year earlier. Gallup asked whether people agreed that most scientists believe global warming is occurring, and 42 percent of Republicans said yes, down from 53 percent a year earlier and back to a level last seen in 2014. Just 35 percent of Republicans said that they believe global warming is caused by human activities, down from 40 percent. Gallup surveyed 1,041 adults nationwide during the first week of March. The survey has a four-point margin of error overall but higher rates for each individual party. Independents also became less convinced about climate change and its impacts. The portion of independents who believe global warming is caused by human behavior fell to 62 percent from 70 percent. ] ",

(John Sleezer/Kansas City Star/AP) Major League Opening Day, like baseball itself, is part of American identity. This year, the experience for fans sitting closest to the field will be different. For the first time, in each Major League park, [protective netting will extend to the end of the dugouts](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes .com_2018_01_31_sports_baseball_baseball- 2Dnetting.html&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=_9hD3xzK5Tf7yaruLxJ3L9Oz2d8kogGwQBbHCMJGA6Y&m=DxxKzM2jDDTYSGzCyg9PH4gH1bU4PpRnQ5KCu0cT75I&s=tvDSRpChoCPDOLtbCJ7JS6bZII_meUhGGYuQ1hQ5UEU&e=), shielding more fans from foul balls than in the past. The netting offers protection to the ticket holders that the team has deemed most valuable 4 at least, those not perched aloft\\xa0in luxury boxes. **\\xa0** Teams\\xa0have moved the best seats closer to the field and provided unique perks to the fans sitting in them to increase revenue and confer more status on those who sit there. This has resulted in teams attracting people who are not die-hard fans. They come to the game as a corporate perk, or to woo clients, rarely armed\\xa0with a baseball glove to catch a foul ball. These new and\\xa0more casual fans, seeking the status-boost of expensive seats, have been a boon for owners. But they 4 and the nets required to protect them 4 are also part of broader trends in the United States happening outside the ballpark, where a growing wealth disparity belies notions of equality. There was a time when America 9s national pastime seemed to reflect America 9s promise. A journalist summarized this viewpoint in 1911, saying that baseball games provided a cspirit of true democracy broad enough to include the heads of the nation and the nation 9s humblest citizen, a great, leveling, cosmopolitan force where differences of race and station vanish away. Such pronouncements about baseball stadiums as democratic spaces, ones where all fans were equal, were never true. But this perception passed muster because at the time, class divisions in the park were limited. In the smaller parks that teams used at the beginning of the 20th century, fans often sat close to the playing field, fostering an intimate experience. But some of the danger of sitting close to the field was mitigated because Major League teams drew fewer fans 100 years ago than they do today. The fans who did come to games were likely to be die-hards, interested in playing close attention to the game and not surprised by foul balls. Die-hard fans had a chance to grab the best seats at the time because front- row tickets did not cost all that much more than bleacher seats. For example, at Shibe Park in Philadelphia in 1915, [bleacher seats cost a quarter (roughly $6 in today 9s dollars) and lower-level grandstand seats cost $1 (roughly $24 in today 9s dollars)](https://sabr.org/bioproj/parks/connie-mack- stadium). Although there were class divisions within the park, they were less severe than they are today. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, however, a number of Major League teams moved into multipurpose facilities designed to host both baseball and football. In order to fit a baseball diamond and a rectangular football field into the same facility, the seats closest to the playing field had to be pulled farther away than they had been at older parks. There was no need for more netting because the best seats were not that close to the field. These stadiums, however 4 perhaps most notably the Houston Astrodome, which introduced luxury skyboxes and a 474-foot scoreboard to the world 4 led to increasing divergence between the fan experience for someone with means to splurge for a top ticket and someone stuck in the cheap seats. The gap between a skybox and a $1.50 seat was vast and unmistakable. A new wave of more intimate retro-inspired ballparks swept through Major League Baseball after the opening of Camden Yards in Baltimore in 1992. These parks, all designed exclusively as baseball venues, allowed fans to again [sit closer to the action](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https- 3A__www.fangraphs.com_blogs_ballpark-2Dplaying-2Dsurfaces-2Dare-2Dshrinking- 2Din-2Da-2Dsurprising- 2Dway_&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=_9hD3xzK5Tf7yaruLxJ3L9Oz2d8kogGwQBbHCMJGA6Y&m=DxxKzM2jDDTYSGzCyg9PH4gH1bU4PpRnQ5KCu0cT75I&s=9_OOx3SiedGdO2xMxvQB1w2rkuc0X1r6ywWEMZc5WHI&e=). Yet despite being modeled on parks with minimal divisions between the most expensive and cheapest seats, facilities like Camden Yards brought with them the inequality nurtured at the massive stadiums of midcentury. In fact, they fostered even greater divisions than their multisport predecessors. The [cheap seats at these new parks were much farther from the action](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.fangraphs .com_blogs_the-2Dnew-2Dgeneration-2Dof-2Dballparks-2Dis-2Dpushing-2Dus- 2Daway_&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=_9hD3xzK5Tf7yaruLxJ3L9Oz2d8kogGwQBbHCMJGA6Y&m=DxxKzM2jDDTYSGzCyg9PH4gH1bU4PpRnQ5KCu0cT75I&s =J940qRCVYlJu-UWhhHiJj3KuyY2KYqYJK92WGjQQpFM&e=) than they had been in early- 20th-century parks, because architects were determined to avoid seats with views obstructed by support pillars. These parks attracted new fans drawn to the novelty of a fancy facility, often marketed as clean and family-friendly, and the bevy of distractions teams created to entertain fans who did not live and die with every pitch. They include everything from barbecue pits to playgrounds for bored children to the now-defunct butcher shop at the new Yankee Stadium. The stadiums also include giant videoboards, drawing fan attention away from the field. The best seats even have exclusive amenities 4 from better food to waiter service 4 that aim to attract the casual fan or business executive seeking status or wining and dining clients. Close seats and constant distraction put new fans and business tycoons in danger, contributing to injuries caused by foul balls. In the last few years, footage of fans being struck and severely injured by foul balls resulted in calls, including from [players,](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u =http-3A__www.philly.com_philly_blogs_sports_phillies_Freddy-2DGalvis- 2Dadamant-2D-2DPhillies-2Dshould-2Dextend-2Dprotective-2Dnetting-2Dafter- 2Dball-2Dstrikes- 2Dgirl.html&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=_9hD3xzK5Tf7yaruLxJ3L9Oz2d8kogGwQBbHCMJGA6Y&m=DxxKzM2jDDTYSGzCyg9PH4gH1bU4PpRnQ5KCu0cT75I&s=GFBUvWa9f2EED6SOy6JQVp2sRWMs_TtKmHRpQmzuMhI&e=) for increased protection. The outcry prompted teams to erect larger protective nets. But expanded netting doesn 9t just signal a desire to protect fans, but to protect the growing divide at the ballpark 4 which, in turn, reflects the growing divide in American society. Gone from the park are references to a democracy based on equality, replaced instead with a democracy based on wealth 4 something as true outside the ballpark as inside it. Americans at the ballpark, like Americans in broader society, have equal access only to what they can pay for. While everyone in the stadium watches the game, fans are only on equal terms with those who can pay as much as they do. And while that inequality may not have the same consequences as similar inequities in health care, education and criminal justice, it does suggest how deep the wealth divide extends 4 right into the heart of America 9s pastime. ] ",

Board of Education meant to her. Her legacy will be that she shared all of her life with all of us,\" Campbell said. She was also instrumental in one of the church day care programs, Campbell said. \"She would read books to children, she was all about children and education.\"  A 'normal' schoolchild who transformed the country The court [ruled](https://www.archives.gov/files/education/lessons/brown-v-board/images/decision.jpg) in May 1954 that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,\" a violation of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that no citizen can be denied equal protection under the law. Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP's special counsel and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, argued the case before the Supreme Court. \"Linda Brown is one of that special band of heroic young people who, along with her family, courageously fought to end the ultimate symbol of white supremacy -- racial segregation in public schools. She stands as an example of how ordinary schoolchildren took center stage in transforming this country,\" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel at NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \"It was not easy for her or her family, but her sacrifice broke barriers and changed the meaning of equality in this country.\" The ruling overturned Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the separate but equal doctrine that formed the legal basis for Jim Crow laws. The court directed schools to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed,\" but it failed to establish a firm timetable for doing so. The Supreme Court would outline the process of school desegregation in Brown II in 1955, but it would take years for schools across the nation to fully comply. Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer on Monday acknowledged Brown's contribution to American history. \"Sixty-four years ago a young girl from Topeka brought a case that ended segregation in public schools in America. Linda Brown's life reminds us that sometimes the most unlikely people can have an incredible impact and that by serving our community we can truly change the world.\" > 64 years ago a young girl from Topeka brought a case that ended segregation in public schools in America.

When her father joined the lawsuit, neighborhoods in Topeka were partially integrated, Brown [said in a 1985 interview](http://digital.wustl.edu/e/eop/eopweb/smi0015.0647.098lindabrownsmith.html) for the documentary series \"Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years.\" \"I played with children that were Spanish-American. I played with children that were white, children that were Indian, and black children in my neighborhood,\" she said. High schools and junior high schools were integrated, too, she said. The only schools that were not were elementary schools, including hers, Monroe Elementary School, she said. In 1954, there were four African-American schools and 18 white schools in Topeka. To reach the bus that carried her and her sisters 2 miles across town to the all-black school, she said she had to walk through railroad yards and across a busy avenue. \"I remember the walk as being very long at that time,\" she said in 1985. \"And then when wintertime came, it was a very cold walk. I remember that. I remember walking, tears freezing up on my face, because I began to cry because it was so cold, and many times I had to turn around and run back home.\" In 1950 her father, a welder and an associate pastor, joined the Topeka NAACP's legal challenge to a Kansas law that permitted racially segregated elementary schools in certain cities based on population. He attempted to enroll her in Sumner Elementary School in 1951. \"My father was like a lot of other black parents here in Topeka at that time. They were concerned not about the quality of education that their children were receiving, they were concerned about the amount -- or distance, that the child had to go to receive an education,\" Brown said in the 1985 interview. \"He felt that it was wrong for black people to have to accept second-class citizenship, and that meant being segregated in their schools, when in fact, there were schools right in their neighborhoods that they could attend, and they had to go clear across town to attend an all-black school. And this is one of the reasons that he became involved in this suit, because he felt that it was wrong for his child to have to go so far a distance to receive a quality education.\" Monroe and Sumner elementary schools became National Historic Landmarks on May 4, 1987, according to the National Park Service. President George H.W. Bush signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site Act of 1992 on October 26, 1992, which established Monroe as a national park. ] ",

(HBO)  cNotes From the Field is an acclaimed one-woman play by the award- winning writer and actor Anna Deavere Smith that delves into the United States 9 school-to-prison pipeline, its inequitable justice system and its struggle to adequately address issues of class and race. Now it is set to reach a wider audience through an HBO production, premiering Feb. 24. Smith talks in the following Q&A; about her project, which entailed interviewing some 250 people around the country and spotlights 18 people she interviewed, starting in 2013. They include Kevin Moore, a Baltimore deli worker who happened to videotape the 2015 police beating of Freddie Gray as they dragged him into a van; Niya Kenny, a high school student in Columbia, S.C., who videotaped\\xa0a sheriff 9s deputy slamming a 16-year-old girl on the floor; and more well-known figures, such as civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). Here are excerpts of our conversation: **Q) What is cNotes From the Field about and why did you choose this subject to write about 4 the school-to-prison pipeline?** **A)** cNotes is about kids who can 9t get through school, who get pushed out of school for disciplinary reasons. When you 9re not in school, you are in trouble and you end up in juvenile hall, and then in various circles of incarceration. Data collected by the Justice Department in the Obama administration showed that black, brown and Native American kids are disciplined more harshly than their white counterparts and that these strict disciplinary tendencies lead them to be expelled and suspended more often. And I looked at that against the background of what began to look like in 2014 a new civil justice, civil rights movement, based largely on the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and others. But I was also hearing a lot about education as a potential background for the civil rights movements. It seems to me that right now, it is really a moment for many Americans, including the students in Parkland, [Fla., site of a mass shooting at a high school on Feb. 14], who are asking about the investments this country makes. Are we going to invest in schools or prisons? **Q) How did you go about researching the subject, and did anything surprise you?** **A)** I did 250 interviews in four geographic areas of the country. I didn 9t know anything about the school-to-prison pipeline, so it all surprised me. I had to open up my learning curve about that. Everything I began to hear, including the language, was new to me. For example, I didn 9t anticipate that, as I looked at school discipline, I would learn things about trauma, Adverse Childhood Experiences scores, stress, how poverty affects not only emotional development but also cognitive development. I was surprised that people working on this issue range from Abby Abinanti, the chief judge of the Yurok tribe, who is one kind of jurist; to Tani Cantil- Sakauye, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the state of California; to a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University, who is studying in his lab what sort of interventions might work. And I also didn 9t expect to be in a world where you have, on one hand, activists who would say that all these things are about structural racism, and on the other hand, Bruce McEwen at Rockefeller, who is looking at it through the lens of biology. And of course, the kids themselves. I have to say it was an extraordinary tapestry that I saw. Because there are so many diverse voices out there addressing it, whether it is a kid who I talked to in a juvenile facility or whether it is a jurist or a teacher or a principal, or a philanthropist like Agnes Gund, who you probably read about. She sold a [Robert]\\xa0Rauschenberg painting for $165 million to spend that money on a fund to support art and social justice. So I have a very high level of excitement and hope about what can come out of this moment. **Q) What about the Trump administration and its approach? Approaches such as restorative justice aren 9t at the top of its list.** The news changes all the time, but there are people out there working on this all the time. We have a new administration looking at it in very different ways, and a new secretary of education. \\u2026 I 9ll just say that I believe in the Obama administration, we had a sense of an administration that had \\u2026 kindness and compassion running through it. In terms of racial equity, these matters have been with us forever. \\u2026 Jefferson lays out a plan for public education which will find the excellent ones and get rid of, and I quote, cthe rubbish. From the beginning, the idea was to have schools as a sorting mechanism. As we have become more complex in our world and more technological, that sorting mechanism just doesn 9t work for a lot of folks. And it 9s funny, the sorting mechanism has gotten more and more intense at the same time. The sorting mechanism for excellence has gotten more intense and the sorting mechanism for failure has gotten more intense. When my late mother 4 who even in her death has been a big inspiration for me in this project because she was a teacher and all her friends were 4 taught, she didn 9t believe there was such a thing as a non-reader. She taught sixth grade and was committed to making sure that nobody would leave her sixth-grade class without reading. I remember this 13-year-old boy sitting around our table learning to read. \\u2026 It 9s odd that these sorting mechanism have become more sophisticated but they don 9t really help people. They pathologize the people who can 9t make it. They privilege the people who can, those who Michael Sandel wrote a wonderful book that I looked at for my last play, cLet Me Down Easy, called c[The Case Against Perfection](https://www.amazon.com /Case-against-Perfection-Michael-Sandel- ebook/dp/B002KFZF08/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=). So while too many American children are failing, being pushed out dropping out, a whole bunch of others are being pushed toward superhuman excellence. If these parents could figure out a drug to make their kids more beautiful, faster, smart, they would; because the competition to get into these colleges is so great. So I don 9t think this has served anybody, honestly. I think this has corrupted what learning is. I am learning. That 9s the only thing I can do well. I can learn things. I can spend my life learning. **Q) If you had the power to make changes to address the school-to-prison pipeline, what did your research tell you that should be?** A) I wouldn 9t be a good policymaker, and I hope that cNotes From the Field is a mating call to people who do make policy. For example, I recall I invoked the name of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of California. I 9m an actor. She really wanted me to come and speak to a conference of judges from all across the United States. She probably thought that a person like me, who is trained to move hearts and minds, has something to offer her. Well, she would be a fantastic person to be at a roundtable about policy. I understand my limitations. \\u2026 This play is meant to be what it is, a film, a work of art that I hope will excite people who have different resources and different kinds of abilities than I do to make a difference. There is this one thing that is different about the United States of America. I said before I went to four geographic areas and did 250 interviews. Police officers, in and out of jails, probation officers, intellectuals, physicians. Almost nobody ever used a word that I think is really important and that I did see at my mother 9s dining room table: love. But when I went to Finland, which at the time was said to have the best education system in the world, I met the equivalent to our secretary of education, and she was using the word clove a lot. I said, cWow, I never heard anybody use that word in the U.S. when talking about this. \\u2026 They just looked at me like I was crazy. How can you talk about education if you don 9t use the word clove d? _**Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a Rockefeller University neurobiologist.\\xa0His name is Bruce McEwen, not Bruce McKewan.**_ ] ",

      "article": "[  Lloyd Blankfein may not be ready to say when he 9ll give up his crown, but that 9s not because there 9s no one around to take it. The investment bank tapped Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon in late 2016 to work as co-presidents as part of a reshuffling of top managers. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter it didn 9t identify, reported Friday that Blankfein, 63, may retire as soon as the end of this year and be replaced by either Schwartz or Solomon. But the CEO later tweeted that it was the newspaper 9s announcement and not his.  cI feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy,\" wrote Blankfein, who has led the New York-based firm for 12 years.        Part of a CEO 9s responsibility is to develop and retain talent, cwhich means eventually stepping aside, Jeffrey Harte, a Sandler O 9Neill & Partners analyst, said in a phone interview. cThey 9ve got a couple of solid candidates and it might be time for the good of the firm to give the next generation a try. Blankfein hasn 9t set a timetable for his departure or spoken with senior colleagues about any plans to step down by year-end, a person with knowledge of his thinking told Bloomberg on Friday. Still, with markets turning volatile and Goldman Sachs on pace for a strong year, there could be worse times for Blankfein to hand over the reins, Harte said.  cIf Goldman has a good earnings year, it gives Lloyd an opportunity to go out on top, he said. While Schwartz, a former chief financial officer, and Solomon, who ran the investment-banking business for a decade, have taken different career paths at the firm, both are well known to shareholders, cso there 9s a level of comfort with either, Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities, said in an interview. The firm 9s long-term focus on investment banking and asset management cwould tip the scale toward David Solomon, even though the nice thing with Harvey is that he 9s been out in front of investors a lot, Harte said. cHistory would say where the business is stronger, is where the successor comes from.     If Blankfein does choose to stick around a while, there 9s always the chance the firm looks beyond the two co-presidents for his replacement. Here 9s a list of some leading contenders.  Harvey M.

(Philip Scott Andrews for The Washington Post) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, an agency charged with ensuring equal access to housing following generations of government-endorsed racial segregation, is considering removing the words cfree from discrimination from its mission statement. The potential change, which caught the agency 9s career staff by surprise, is part of can effort to align HUD 9s mission with the Secretary 9s priorities and that of the Administration, according to a March 5 [memo](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hud-mission- statement_us_5a9f5db0e4b002df2c5ec617) sent to political staff obtained by HuffPost. The proposed statement chops the current [63-word mission](https://www.hud.gov/about/mission) on HUD 9s website down to 23 words\\xa0 4 and puts an emphasis on cself-sufficiency, a mantra that HUD Secretary Ben Carson has been touting in public appearances.\\xa0The agency has confirmed the memo's authenticity and\\xa0said the new statement has not been finalized. It reads: cHUD 9s mission is to ensure Americans have access to fair, affordable housing and opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency, thereby strengthening our communities and nation. Also gone are references to cinclusive communities, consumer protections and cquality homes for all.  cIt 9s a significant symbolic shift, said one longtime HUD employee who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation. cIt 9s the tip of the iceberg in terms of the kinds of changes they are making. This administration has not included career people in these decisions. Amy Thompson, HUD 9s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in her memo that the working statement had been developed with input from Carson and others. She also asked political staff for feedback. [Lynne Patton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/18/here-is- the-official-resume-of-the-person-trump-put-in-charge-of-federal-housing-in- new-york/?utm_term=.62e39dc00e09), whom Trump has charged with running one of the agency 9s largest regional offices, overseeing New York and New Jersey, said changes to the mission statement have been in the works for a couple of months. Patton said she personally solicited ideas from both career staff and political appointees in her region and submitted draft versions to the agency 9s headquarters, and she considers it a work in progress. \"It's no secret that empowering people with the tools to ascend the economic ladder to self-sufficiency is one of the main missions of both this administration and Secretary Carson,\" Patton said. \"Leadership simply wanted a motto that better reflects that goal, too.\" Carson launched an initiative in December to put so-called EnVision Centers near public housing developments to foster self-sufficiency among the poor. The centers were to focus on\\xa0character and leadership, educational advancement, economic empowerment and health and wellness. The New York Times [reported this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/ben-carson- hud.html) that potential donors were skeptical that Carson, a retired neurosurgeon with no professional experience in housing, could pull it off. Carson in the past has [criticized federal efforts to desegregate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/07/what-ben- carson-gets-wrong-about-segregation-in-america/?utm_term=.039a6ea61af1) America's neighborhoods as csocial engineering.\" He has delayed implementing an Obama-era rule requiring communities seeking HUD funding to study the impediments to fair housing in their areas, and he compared such attempts to integrate neighborhoods to the c[failed social experiment](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/23/ben-carson- obamas-housing-rules-try-to-accomplish-/) of mandated school busing. Carson also tried to delay implementing [an Obama-era rule](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/28/hundreds-of- thousands-of-poor-americans-will-soon-be-able-to-move-to-better-areas-thanks- to-this-judge/?utm_term=.2b4987393509) that would give low-income families in two dozen metro regions greater access to housing in more affluent neighborhoods, where they would benefit from better schools, lower crime rates and more job opportunities. But a federal judge ordered HUD to comply starting January. Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the\\xa0National Low Income Housing Coalition, said removing anti-discrimination language from the agency's mission statement is the latest move by Carson to de-emphasize HUD's role in creating inclusive communities.  cSecretary Carson is sending a message to the country that he does not take discrimination in the housing market seriously. It 9s especially appalling, as we near the 50th\\xa0anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, that Secretary Carson would signal this step away from Dr. King 9s legacy,\" Yentel said in a statement. \"Thankfully, the law trumps a mission statement, so those legal obligations remain. Raffi Williams, an agency spokesman, characterized the proposed changes to HUD's mission statement as cmodest in an effort to articulate the agency 9s work in a cclear and concise way.  cYou can be sure of one thing 4any mission statement for this Department will embody the principle of fairness as a central element of everything that we do, Williams said in a statement. cHUD has been, is now, and will always be committed to ensuring inclusive housing, free from discrimination for all Americans.

While boys in the UK aimed to be footballers or YouTube stars, their counterparts in Uganda and Zambia wanted to be doctors or teachers. The findings are from a[ survey of 20,000 children ](https://www.educationandemployers.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/01/DrawingTheFuture.pdf)by the Education and Employers careers charity. The results are to be presented to business leaders at Davos next week. The study asked primary school children, aged seven to 11, in 20 countries to draw pictures of the jobs they wanted to have when they grew up.     Gender roles The careers charity said the results showed how much gender stereotypes were established from an early age. In the UK, girls were much less likely to want to become engineers or scientists.  Image caption Teaching was one of the most sought after jobs in many countries  But jobs such as nurse, dancer and hairdresser were among their top 10 ambitions. And boys were more likely to want to have jobs such as airline pilot and mechanic. Girls' top choices were more focused on academic success - with jobs such as teacher, vet and doctor among the most popular. By contrast, boys seemed to be much more influenced by popular culture, with jobs such as sportsman, working in social media or the police.  Social mobility In terms of social mobility, the charity said the survey showed young people needed to be introduced to different types of careers at an early age. Girls in more deprived schools were more likely to want to be shop workers and beauty therapists, while better-off boys wanted to be managers and lawyers.  Image caption Boys were more likely to want to be scientists and engineers  Outside of the UK, the drawings often showed high aspirations despite hardship. In Uganda and the Philippines, girls most want to be teachers. In Pakistan, Bangladesh, Colombia and Indonesia they want to be doctors. In China, the most popular career ambition for boys is a scientist.  Image caption In China, being a chef was named as a popular job  But across both the UK and international findings, there was a huge mismatch between the reality of the jobs market and the expectations of young people.  'Break the mould' And the charity said this misalignment remained a problem for older pupils, with a lack of advice available about what skills were really going to be in demand. \"Careers counselling in secondary schools comes far too late,\" said the OECD's education director, Andreas Schleicher. \"It is clear from the drawings that children arrive in school with strong assumptions based on their own day-to-day experiences,\" said Mr Schleicher.  Image caption Vets were a popular choice for a job, particularly for girls  \"The findings have implications for all of us seeking to improve social mobility,\" said David Cruickshank, global chairman of Deloitte and chair of trustees for Education and Employers. \"Children's career aspirations are most influenced by who they know,\" he said. Anne Lyons, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it showed how hard it was for young people to \"break the mould\" of their families' expectations. Nick Chambers, chief executive of Education and Employers, said it showed the need for children in primary school to hear about the \"vast range of career options open to them and are not ruling things out at an early age\".

      "article": "[ President Trump celebrated the milestone on Twitter and in his State of the Union address. The unemployment rate for black Americans had hit its lowest point on record, a sign that the recovery was at last reaching groups that had been left behind. , But the achievement was bittersweet: Black joblessness was still roughly twice the rate for whites. , Even at the low of 6.8 percent recorded in December 4 it climbed back to 7.7 percent in January 4 the unemployment level for black Americans would qualify as a near crisis for whites. And the relative gains have not erased disparities in opportunity and pay. , A tight labor market alone can 9t undo a legacy of unequal school funding, residential segregation or the disproportionate rate of incarceration for black Americans. Nor can it reverse the gradual shift of well-paying jobs from inner cities to mostly white suburbs. Studies have found that discrimination in hiring and pay persists even in good economic times, making parity an elusive goal. ,  cIt 9s not microwaveable, said Louis King, who runs a training program in Minnesota that aims to put minority workers into construction and health care careers. cYou don 9t press a button and it suddenly changes. , On paper, the state 9s economy gave Mr. King a good chance at success. Minnesota 9s jobless rate is far lower than the national average, making employers particularly hungry for workers they may once have shut out. , As in many states, black workers in Minnesota are finding a more hospitable economy. The black unemployment rate there went from 23.5 percent in 2011 to 7.5 percent last month but remained at [more than twice the rate](https://www.twincities.com/2018/01/18/minnesota-job-gains-lead-to- lowest-unemployment-rate-for-blacks-on-record/) for whites. ,  cThis is not time for celebration, said Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution, whose research has examined race and structural inequality. cYes, the strong economy is exciting high-growth areas, but blacks are still filling temporary positions or low-wage jobs that result in a flat level of income. , Nationwide, the typical annual pay for a black person working full time was just under $40,000 in 2016, compared with $52,000 for a white worker. , No amount of education alters the imbalance. Black workers with a high school diploma take home 22 percent less than whites with the same credential. Those with graduate degrees fall nearly as far behind their white peers. , Mr. King has been working to alter that dynamic 4 ever since he arrived in Minneapolis in 1989. He found that the black people who had jobs were mostly flipping burgers or minding cash registers at convenience stores. , There weren 9t creal soul-food restaurants, he said, or many prominent black businesses of any kind. It was hard for him to see how black children would climb economically without knowing whether people who looked like them ever landed on top. , So Mr. King, a former Army commander who trained soldiers, founded Summit Academy, a vocational school. He spent years trying to persuade people to actually hire his graduates. , In 2009, as the nation was trying to climb out of the recession and Minnesota 9s legislature was debating how to spend federal stimulus money, Mr. King sent busloads of his students to legislative hearings. They arrived early, filling out rows of seats normally occupied by lobbyists. , They showed up on construction sites in lab coats, carrying magnifying glasses, looking diligently for the black workers. They submitted a cmissing-persons report to local officials to highlight the lack of black workers on public projects. , The timing couldn 9t have been better for Carmen Richardson. She had just quit her job plating metal for a pittance when she saw an ad for Summit. After she graduated from the program five months later, the biggest names in the construction business were competing for her. ,  cI was getting recruited like I was a basketball player, Ms. Richardson said. cI was in shape, I was a female and I was black, so that was the golden ticket. , She started out earning $24 an hour in 2011, and became a part of the carpenter 9s union. She got a pension and full medical coverage. She bought a Suzuki motorcycle and, last year, a Dodge Charger. ,  cGot my first speeding ticket in that sucker, Ms. Richardson said. , Now she earns $37 at Mortenson, a construction giant that played a critical role in opening doors for people like her. , A changing economic calculus helped. There simply weren 9t enough workers to meet the needs of a city that built [three major](http://www.startribune.com/the-twin-cities-have-too-many-stadiums-but- they-are-in-the-right-places/431373873/)[ sports ](http://www.startribune.com /the-twin-cities-have-too-many-stadiums-but-they-are-in-the-right- places/431373873/)[stadiums](http://www.startribune.com/the-twin-cities-have- too-many-stadiums-but-they-are-in-the-right-places/431373873/) in a decade. ,  cWe knew that demographic shift was happening, said David Mortenson, the company 9s chairman. White Minnesotans, who sent generations of young men into the trades, were suddenly seeking a higher purpose 4 college degrees, office jobs. , Economic theory suggests that a strong labor market like Minnesota 9s 4 and, increasingly, the country 9s as a whole 4 makes outright discrimination expensive. Companies can hardly afford to turn away qualified people when there are so many jobs to fill. , Racial gaps do seem to narrow during better economic times. In mid-2010, just 67 percent of African-Americans ages 25 to 54 were employed. Among whites, the figure was 77 percent 4 a 10-point difference. Today, that chasm has shrunk to about six points, the smallest it has been since 2000. , Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said that when he took the job two years ago, he was surprised that the bank 9s economists couldn 9t conclusively say what caused the divide. ,  cIf we can 9t even answer the 8why, 9 we can 9t hope to design policy solutions to close those gaps, Mr. Kashkari said. , Still, Mr. Kashkari said, companies do behave differently when workers are scarcer. That is certainly true in Minneapolis, where Mr. Mortenson helped force the city 9s builders into action. , The company pushed trade unions to diversify their ranks and told its subcontractors cthey weren 9t going to get our business if they didn 9t pull their weight, Mr. Mortenson said. , It also hired diversity trainers to consult with almost every foreman and supervisor at all of its work sites, and brought in ccultural competency coaches to work with high-level executives on implicit bias. ,  cYou had a white-owned company with white leadership saying to people we are doing the right thing, said Mr. King, the Summit Academy leader. cIt became a condition of business. , But integrating the old boys 9 club is not always particularly fun for the newcomers, as Marvin Parrish Jr. learned on his first day on the job after graduating from Summit. Mr. Parrish, a former convict from Detroit, was the only black person working at the site. , A white carpenter once asked him why, cif we are equal, there was a need for affirmative action. , Mr. Parrish, 33, kept his head down, rushing through his grunt work so that he 9d have time to watch the old hands perform more complex maneuvers, recording their moves to mimic them later. ,  cI was working twice as hard as the next guy by me, and thinking five times faster than him just to stay afloat, Mr. Parrish said. He became a lead carpenter. , Still, he noticed that when it came time to solve a problem or analyze a blueprint, his manager would bring over a white person to handle it. cI was pushed aside, Mr. Parrish said. , He eventually got a job as a foreman at Thor Construction, a black-owned builder, where he needs more than two hands to count the number of black tradespeople on site. cWe aren 9t just a quota or a goal, Mr. Parrish said. cThey are actually just hiring good workers. , Mr. Parrish is working on buying a house with his wife in the suburbs, where he lives with his two children now. He sometimes drives them into the city to see the stadiums he 9s laid hands on, to show them what their father built. ] ",

(Rebecca Blackwell/Associated Press) ORLANDO 4 Soccer is part of the American immigrant story, and although he never amounted to much as a player before he turned to higher education and a successful business career, Carlos Cordeiro appreciates the role the sport plays in the lives of millions of transplants. He was born in India to a Colombian mother and Portuguese father. After his father was killed in an auto accident, Cordeiro and three siblings moved with their mother to south Florida. Their immigrant experience helped shape his views, and as [the first president of the U.S. Soccer Federation with Latino roots](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2018/02/10 /carlos-cordeiro-elected-president-of-the-u-s-soccer- federation/?utm_term=.0e723cc3107e), he said he will lead a stronger effort to make the game more accessible to minority communities.  cI am a proud American, but I am an immigrant, said Cordeiro, 61. cI came to this country when I was 15. I have had a terrific education. I 9m the beneficiary of all of that. I owe all of that to the American system.  cFor us to grow the sport into a preeminent position, we have to be more inclusive. We have to reach out to those underserved or diverse immigrant populations. It can 9t be that we only have 3 or 3 1/2 million kids playing soccer in this country. We know there are more, but they are just not playing under the [USSF 9s] umbrella. For years, critics of U.S. soccer leadership have pointed to a flawed system that prices out lower-income families and overlooks minorities, particularly Latin American families, who have been at the forefront of U.S. immigration for decades. As the USSF 9s vice president for two years and a figure in the federation since 2007, Cordeiro was part of that leadership. He does not escape blame. To the USSF 9s credit, it did make some strides under Cordeiro 9s predecessor, Sunil Gulati, who decided not to seek a fourth term in the wake of the World Cup qualifying disaster last fall. Still, there is enormous work to do on the immigrant front, Cordeiro acknowledged. During an\\xa0[ cAim Higher campaign](https://www.carlos4soccer.com/), he raised the issue of affordability and accessibility. (To be fair, so did the other seven candidates.) One of the biggest criticisms of Gulati is that he operated in the high-end circles of international soccer and didn 9t pay enough attention to the state associations, which are on the front lines of youth development. Those include the immigrant and lower-income communities.  cWe have to reach out and get them and bring them in, Cordeiro said. cTo the extent we are successful, we are going to have a lot better players over time. In a [pre-election interview with the Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/mls/article198019704.html), Cordeiro said:\\xa0 cMy vision is really about reinvigorating our grass roots, which I think over the last 10 to 15 years has suffered as a huge amount of resources have gone into our elite players and national teams. In his efforts, Cordeiro will have to combat perceptions that he, like Gulati, is out of touch with the rank and file. Cordeiro was never a coach or administrator. He came to the USSF in 2007 as an independent director and specialized in budgetary matters, with decades of experience in high finance. From humble beginnings, he did very well for himself. A graduate of both Harvard and Harvard Business School, Cordeiro was a partner at Goldman Sachs and worked for several other international firms. He retired earlier than most Americans and has several homes. The fact that the USSF presidency is an unpaid position will not burden him in the least. With the election results 4 Cordeiro led on the first two ballots and crossed the 50 percent majority on the third 4 the USSF membership clearly valued his business background. The Chicago-based federation has about 160 employees, a $110 million budget and a $150 million surplus. While the federation is in fine financial shape, Cordeiro will have to find ways to reinvigorate the men 9s national team program following its absence from the World Cup for the first time since 1986. The first step is hiring a general manager, then conducting a search for a head coach. (Dave Sarachan has served as the interim boss since Bruce Arena 9s resignation in the fall.) Cordeiro also will have to ensure the women 9s program, amid increasing global competition, remains at an elite level; identify ways to unclutter the youth development system for both genders; and help a North American joint bid win the rights to host the 2026 World Cup. (FIFA will decide in June.) Cordeiro also has suggested the United States should bid to host the 2027 Women 9s World Cup. Cordeiro admits he does not have all the answers.  cI was impressed with his ideas, his vision for the governance within U.S. soccer, said former World Cup midfielder Stuart Holden, a member of the Athletes Council, which voted as a bloc for Cordeiro. cI also loved that he was vulnerable in saying he is not the smartest soccer guy in the room and he wants to find the smartest soccer guys. That resonated strongly. ] ",

      "article": "[ CHICAGO 4 The race for Illinois governor has come down to this: the multimillionaire versus the billionaire. , Gov. Bruce Rauner, a private-equity executive seeking a second term in office, prevailed in a tough battle for the Republican nomination on Tuesday, while J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire philanthropist and venture capitalist from a prominent Chicago family, won the Democratic nomination for governor, according to the Associated Press. , Their victories promise a contest that will be fiercely fought and dominated by big money, with each candidate controlling tremendous sums of personal wealth to spend on his campaign. The two men have already raised more than $150 million, on track to become one of the most expensive governor 9s races in history. , In the state 9s most closely watched congressional primary, the longtime Chicago-area Representative Daniel Lipinski narrowly defeated a challenger from the left, Marie Newman, according to the A.P. The race became something of a proxy between moderate and progressive Democrats. , In the coming general election campaign for governor, Mr. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain, is expected to present [a serious threat to Mr. Rauner](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/illinois-governor- election.html), who has alienated voters on both the left and the right during his rocky term. For more than three years, a frustrated Mr. Rauner has battled Michael J. Madigan, the powerful Democratic speaker of the House; struggled to implement his own agenda; and, in the process, become one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors in the nation. , But Mr. Rauner, 61, survived a challenge from Jeanne Ives, a Republican legislator and Army veteran who took a hard-right stance on social issues and [attacked him](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/illinois-governor- election.html)[ for being insufficiently conservative](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/illinois-governor- election.html). , Mr. Rauner appealed for unity in a speech on Tuesday night, imploring Republicans, independents and Democrats to give him another term in office to institute needed change. ,  cLet 9s work together to bridge the divide, he said. cThe election in November will be a choice, a clear choice, a choice between someone who will stand up to the machine and someone who has long been part of it. Between someone who will fight for hardworking families and someone who will protect the political insiders. , Mr. Pritzker, who has donated close to $70 million to his own campaign, fell short of 50 percent of the Democratic vote, but still outpaced Chris Kennedy, a businessman and a son of Robert F. Kennedy, and Daniel Biss, a suburban state senator. , In an acceptance speech before a crowd of supporters here on Tuesday night, Mr. Pritzker, 53, called for universal health care, fair wages, protections for labor unions and the legalization of marijuana. , He vowed to be a champion for the needy, for children, and for immigrants who have come to Illinois seeking a better life. ,  cThis campaign is about a fight for economic security, about jobs and wages, Mr. Pritzker said. cI choose to fight for the struggling. I choose to fight for the black and brown communities across our state, for the one thing, the one and only thing you 9ve asked for for so long 4 fairness. ,  cAre you ready for a fight? he said, drawing wild applause. , Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Rauner are fighting to lead a state with deeply entrenched problems. Whoever wins will have to contend with Illinois 9s vastly underfunded pension systems; worries about residents fleeing the state; and a sagging economy downstate, where manufacturing jobs have disappeared, leaving many residents unemployed and financially struggling. , Both men have moved in elite Chicago circles of business and philanthropy for decades, yet they did not share a personal relationship. In an interview last month, Mr. Pritzker said he barely knew Mr. Rauner, and was better acquainted with his wife, Diana Rauner, who runs a public-private partnership focused on early childhood. , Mr. Rauner, a native of Chicago 9s wealthy north suburbs who made a fortune as the chairman of a private-equity firm, presented himself to voters in 2013 as an outsider, a Harley-riding political newcomer with a folksy affect who would [fix Illinois 9s financial problems](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/us/politics/in-illinois-bruce- rauners-campaign-promises-are-about-to-meet-budget-realities.html) and make the state more attractive to companies. , Mr. Rauner 9s tenure has been marked by a budget impasse that paralyzed Illinois, especially social-service agencies, arts organizations and public universities that depend on state funding. It was finally resolved last July when Democrats in the State Legislature [overrode Mr. Rauner 9s veto](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/us/illinois-budget-shutdown-states- rauner.html), ending the stalemate and passing a budget. , During [his first run for office](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/us /illinois-governors-primaries-to-set-up-vital-race-in-november.html), he rarely mentioned social issues like abortion and managed to attract sizable support from independents and Democrats. As governor, he angered religious conservatives by signing a bill that expanded abortion coverage for women on Medicaid. , Last week, he vetoed a piece of legislation that would have required gun dealers to obtain state licenses, a move that was widely seen as an appeal to Republicans in rural downstate Illinois. , Ms. Ives, a member of the Illinois House, positioned herself as the true conservative in the race. But she trailed Mr. Rauner in fund-raising, raising $4 million to his $100 million. She criticized Mr. Rauner over abortion rights, immigration and his handling of a Legionnaires 9 disease outbreak at a state-run veterans home that has left 13 people dead since 2015. , In the campaign 9s final days, the Democratic Governors Association sneaked into the fray, running a television ad attacking Ms. Ives as ctoo conservative 4 presumably a veiled attempt to give Ms. Ives a boost in the hopes that she could overtake Mr. Rauner in the primary. , In the closely watched congressional primary, Mr. Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, just barely edged out Ms. Newman, who drew on the Trump-era appetite within the party for more confrontational and liberal officeholders as she gave Mr. Lipinski the biggest scare he has had since he was elected in 2004. , Wielding support from an array of progressive groups, Ms. Newman assailed Mr. Lipinski for his opposition to such liberal priorities as abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act. , After attempting to ignore the challenge, Mr. Lipinski scrambled to put down the insurgency with a late blitz of commercials and mailers highlighting his more orthodox positions and roots in Chicago 9s so-called Bungalow Belt. , He succeeded his father in the seat, which has sent a Lipinski to Washington since 1982. But the same southwest side and suburban Chicago precincts that were mainstays of the city 9s Democratic machine are quickly evolving. A growing Hispanic population and the influx of upscale white voters have transformed what were once working-class Irish and Polish neighborhoods. The remaining, machine-aligned precincts in the city were critical in lifting him over Ms. Newman. ,  cI would like Mr. Lipinski to have a very painful evening, so we 9re going to wait, Ms. Newman told supporters after taking the stage around 10:45 p.m. local time Tuesday, adding that she would say more on Wednesday. , While Ms. Newman fell short, her attempt at harnessing the new wave of activism on the left illustrated the way forward for party insurgents, particularly in overwhelmingly Democratic districts. , Republicans have [nominated a perennial candidate with Nazi sympathies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/arthur-jones- illinois.html) to face Mr. Lipinski, but the seat is not competitive. ] ",

There are more than 1,500 independent private K-12 schools in the United States, including some of the country 9s best known, including Sidwell Friends School in Washington, where several presidents sent their children. It is commonly thought that many of these private schools provide a better education than public schools 4 and\\xa0[data published](https://www.nais.org/magazine/independent-school/winter-2018/life- lessons/) recently by the National Association of Independent Schools and Gallup find that their graduates may have better long-term outcomes.

Blodget was both a student of independent schools and a teacher of English and drama, as well as an administrator in five different schools in several states during his nearly four-decade\\xa0academic career.

People no longer seem to trust intuition, experience or observation, and anecdotal evidence causes the eyes to glaze over. If you have a thought, chances are good that few will take it seriously unless some sort of research supports it. Conclusions and evidence based on research-produced numbers increasingly determine not only the direction of decisions but whether a new idea is even considered. Research and data can certainly be important tools in assessing claims and effectiveness and in guiding people as they explore new initiatives, but the elevation of data to a sort of monotheism is dangerous. Numbers offer only one view of reality. Experience offers another. The worship of numbers, especially when those numbers present a reality sharply at odds with the reality that people actually live, can limit or stifle change and innovation. In his foreword to c[Mis-Measuring Our Lives: Why GDP Doesn 9t Add Up](https://www.amazon.com/Mismeasuring-Our-Lives-Why- Doesnt/dp/1595585192), Nicolas Sarkozy wrote about a cgulf of incomprehension between the expert certain in his knowledge and the citizen whose experience of life is completely out of sync with the story told by the data. . . . We wound up mistaking our representations of wealth for the wealth itself and our representations of reality for the reality itself. Sarkozy 9s observations apply to areas other than the economy. Recently, the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) partnered with Gallup to compare the college experiences of NAIS graduates with those of graduates of other high schools. Not surprisingly, its report ([NAIS-Gallup Report on NAIS Graduates](https://www.nais.org/magazine/independent- school/winter-2018/life-lessons/)) showed that NAIS graduates fared better in college and in life after college. Although the survey claims only to look at factors that contribute to a future sense of well-being (good job, good life) rather than how well educated students are, there is a tacit invitation for people to draw conclusions about the superior quality of an NAIS education. As a result, the report could have unintended consequences, the most dangerous of which is confirming a tendency to believe that education in independent schools must be better than what happens in public schools. Comparing NAIS students to students in non-NAIS schools might produce nice marketing fliers, but it can also solidify comfortable self-satisfaction and complacency, lulling independent schools into thinking that they are some sort of model of excellence in learning outcomes. The data from this study are certainly being used in new marketing tools to claim that NAIS schools are superior to public schools. After all, just look at the numbers used in the NAIS fliers: c77 percent of NAIS grads complete college on time, compared to 64 percent of public school grads, and about the same percentages enjoy academic challenges. So why mess with success? Resistance to change has long dominated independent schools, especially those that send large numbers of graduates to Ivy League colleges, and this report offers support to those who prefer to keep things as they are. Data are good; parents are happy. Why rock the boat? I have no doubt that a higher percentage of independent school graduates feel more positive about the categories that the NAIS-Gallup poll measured 4 though I wonder how these percentages are skewed by other variables such as the population of wealthy, motivated students attracted to independent schools vs. the greater range of abilities and resources in the even larger number who go to college from non-NAIS schools. But what do these categories and percentages have to do with education, with meaningful learning? Nothing, and although the report does not claim that they do, the tendency to conflate one with the other is irresistible. What is the reality of independent school? Does it merit this lavish self- congratulation? Finishing college on time, having higher SAT scores, being active in extracurricular activities and feeling prepared for college or enjoying academic challenge are mis-measures of deep learning. Yet the implication seems strong that these categories offer legitimate insight into the overall quality of an NAIS education, which implicitly includes learning. In fact, schools generally do not use assessment tools that measure deep learning. The SAT and ACT provide no insight into students 9 level of skill (what they can do) or complexity of conceptual understanding (what they really know, as opposed to what they have memorized). As a citizen who lives in the gap between the NAIS-Gallup data and my years of experience in independent schools, I see a different reality ccompletely out of sync with the story told by the data. And I know that many of my colleagues share this perception of reality, which comes from faculty rooms and meetings filled with voices ranting about kids who can 9t think, can 9t write, aren 9t curious, don 9t listen, know nothing, remember nothing, can 9t read and don 9t care. Teachers in NAIS schools, as well as public schools, complain about the steady decline in focus and attention span as students become more addicted to social media and smartphones: cI can 9t give the same assignments or tests to these kids that I could give them 15 years ago. At the same time, everyone worries about a reality that produces an increasing number of depressed and anxious students, the kids who can 9t cope with the pressures to get the grades they need to attend ca highly ranked college, where they arrive already burned out. And this reality is reflected, too, in an earlier Gallup poll that identified the two words students most frequently used to describe their experience of school: cbored and ctired. Their words resonate with my own lifetime of experiences and observations of students in many classrooms in different independent schools. Given this reality, does it really matter whether someone finishes college on time? My reality also comes from years of reading books and articles written by others who think about and work in education. The most recent is education philosopher [Zachary Stein](http://www.zakstein.org/blog/), who writes: > The recent economic crisis has involved the best graduates from our most prestigious schools. The key players were our greatest test-takers, our academic overachievers, and those who leveraged Ivy League success to land (unconscionably) high paying jobs in the financial sector. Their greed, incompetence, and narcissistic irreverence speak eloquently to the failure of our educational systems. ( _Education in a Time Between Worlds_ ) Stein is not alone in a belief that the complexity of the problems we face today, from the degradation of our planet to the failure of our economic system, far exceed the capacity of our schools, as currently designed, to help students develop the skills or understanding to solve them. This is the reality that the data produced by the NAIS-Gallup report not only fail to capture but actually hide by implying that learning in NAIS schools must be superior to learning in public schools. One problem with comparing graduates from NAIS schools with those from other schools is that schools are still schools. With a few exceptions, they all, public and private, rest on the same flawed assumptions about how people learn: teaching, telling and learning are synonyms; single skills can be learned in a linear fashion; natural and necessary regression of a skill is failure; emotion interferes with rational thinking and learning; brains come in two forms 4 normal or disabled; performance can be judged independent of context; recall is evidence of learning. We have a system badly in need of\\xa0 rethinking and redesign. One of the reasons so many educators, even in NAIS schools, might perceive that students are not learning in deep, meaningful ways is that students are not learning in deep, meaningful ways. The last thing we need is a poll that assures those of us who work in independent schools that all is well. Unlike most public schools, independent schools have the freedom and resources to rethink education, yet reports like the NAIS-Gallup study are likely to prevent deeper self-examination. After all, the data percentages that the study produced are in our favor. We must be doing something right. Sarkozy warns that ctreating these [statistics] as objective data, as if they are external to us, beyond question or dispute, is undoubtedly reassuring and comfortable, but it 9s dangerous. It 9s dangerous because we get to the point where we stop asking ourselves about the purpose of what we are doing, what we are actually measuring, and what lessons we need to draw. That is how the mind begins to close . \\u2026 We need to focus on more profound questions about the purpose of education and make sure that what we are measuring will allow us to learn the lessons required to improve our schools. Formulating these questions depends on understanding a complex reality. The point is not that data should be ignored. The point is that intuition based on experience and deep knowledge should not be relegated to its current inferior status. Anecdotal evidence can be useful. Data and intuition can be equally valid (or invalid) tools for gaining insight into reality. Intuition can serve as a meaningful check on data; data can serve as a meaningful check on intuition. People need an accurate and complete sense of reality from as many perspectives as possible to improve the actual lives of people 4 those of our students. ] ",

      "article": "[ Raucous cheers echoed off the high marble ceilings of the West Virginia Capitol on Tuesday as [state leaders announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/west-virginia-teachers- strike-deal.html) they had met striking teachers 9 demands for a 5 percent pay raise. ,  cWho made history? chanted the throng of red-clad teachers, who had defied state officials and, at times, even their own union leaders, by staging a nearly two-week walkout. cWe made history! , The strike indeed takes a place in history, and not just for the result. , Since the earliest days of teacher organizing more than a century ago, almost every moment of teacher activism has come during times of social upheaval. In 1897, the modern teachers 9 union movement was born in Chicago, where teachers presided over classrooms of up to 60 children, many of whom could not speak English, in a city surging with immigrants and struggling to control rampant child labor and typhoid in the water. All for the equivalent of $13,000 a year in today 9s dollars. , Later strikes came during struggles over racial inequality and the future of public school teaching itself. And as classrooms light up again across West Virginia this week, teachers will be resuming their daily struggles against two modern ills: an intractable drug crisis on top of a [growing nationwide fear](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/us/threat-school-shooting.html) of bloodshed in the classroom. ,  cThe work is all-encompassing, said Karla Hilliard, a high school English teacher in Martinsburg, W.Va., and one of roughly 20,000 teachers who participated in the statewide strike. ,  cIn West Virginia we deal with high levels of poverty and the opioid epidemic, she said, cbut then there are the smaller things, like kids who come in and they don 9t have support at home and they just need someone to care about them and love them. , The strike began in protest of a plan to give teachers a 2 percent raise this July and 1 percent in each of the next two years, after years of stagnating pay and rising health insurance costs. Last week, after Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, announced a plan to increase pay by 5 percent, union leaders said classes would resume. But teachers refused, demanding that the Legislature vote to make the raise official. That finally happened on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear where the money would come from, but the governor promised there would not be cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor. , Teachers in the state last year earned an average of [about $46,000, $13,000 less](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_211.60.asp?current=yes) than the national average. In only three states did teachers earn less: Mississippi, South Dakota and Oklahoma. In the last week, 40,000 people have joined [a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/257970398074287/) calling for a walkout of Oklahoma teachers. , But some West Virginia lawmakers expressed concern about the cost of the raises. While its [cost of living](https://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living/) is in the middle of the pack, the state is poor: Its median household income of [$43,385](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/acs/acsbr16-02.pdf), according to Census Bureau estimates from 2016, placed it 49th in the nation, ahead of only Mississippi. , West Virginia has the nation 9s [fourth-highest unemployment rate](https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm) and an [opioid overdose death rate](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-death- rates/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) that is more than three times the national average. All of this plays out in the classroom. ,  cI can 9t tell you how many students we have being raised by grandparents because of parents 9 drug addictions, said Jay O 9Neal, a seventh-grade English teacher and a leader of the strike. cIt 9s just part of a broader problem teaching here, dealing with the effects of poverty. , At Mr. O 9Neal 9s school, Stonewall Jackson Middle School in Charleston, teachers use their own money to stock a closet for students whose clothes are dirty or do not fit, or who come in wearing shorts when it is freezing outside. At faculty meetings each year, they draw some children 9s names off an cangel tree and provide them with Christmas gifts, because otherwise they would not get any. , Recently, Mr. O 9Neal said, teachers have noticed that some students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., have been coming to school unmedicated and disrupting an entire class; the teachers suspect parents are selling their children 9s medications. , Since the mid-19th century, it has generally been the women who have been expected to do this kind of difficult, nurturing work. That gender divide played a big role in early teacher activism. , Today, about 75 percent of teachers in West Virginia and across the United States are female. When teachers first unionized in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, 97 percent were women, and they were paid little more than maids. , Policymakers did not see that as a problem. Instead, they wanted to devote their extra funds to recruiting male teachers, who they thought would be tougher, and thus better able to control those huge, 60-student classes. , The female teachers got angry, launched their federation, and within several years had secured a raise. They shocked the nation 9s elite by marching, in petticoats, alongside Teamsters and other male unionists. , Margaret Haley, a founder of the Chicago Teachers Federation, was inspired by Susan B. Anthony and other suffragists, just as today, some West Virginia teachers have come to activism through the [2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/women-march-protest-president- trump.html?action=click&contentCollection=U.S.&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article)[ Women 9s March](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/women-march-protest- president- trump.html?action=click&contentCollection=U.S.&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article), the [MeToo](https://www.nytimes.com/series/metoo-moment) movement or [Black Lives Matter](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/us/how-blacklivesmatter-came- to-define-a-movement.html). , The politics of teacher strikes shift over time, but in every generation, their leaders have forged ties to broader social movements. Many of the union leaders who led the nation 9s most famous 4 or infamous 4 teacher strike, in [New York City in 1968](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/weekinreview/echoes-of-a-new-york- waterloo.html), were first active in the civil rights movement, including the 1963 March on Washington and Freedom Summer in 1964. Nevertheless, when black and Latino activists pushed for community and parent control of struggling schools, including the right to remove teachers, the union went on strike to protect teachers 9 tenure rights. , The seven-day [teacher strike in Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/education/teacher-strike-begins- in-chicago-amid-signs-that-deal-isnt-close.html) in 2012 came a year after Occupy Wall Street, and rode a wave of dissatisfaction with elite influence in public education. Teachers won a raise and successfully pushed back against Mayor Rahm Emanuel 9s desire to evaluate teachers based on their students 9 test scores. , Today in West Virginia, policymakers have their own ideas about how to improve schools. The State Department of Education has [revamped vocational education](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/us/west-virginia-vocational- education.html), while the Republican-controlled Legislature has [debated](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/education/wv-legislature-likely- to-address-teacher-seniority-issue/article_266e0899-b73b-50ef-84af- 5531c961c56d.html) weakening teachers 9 seniority protections and providing parents with tax incentives to pay for private school tuition. , But the striking teachers asked that the State Legislature first consider the basics: the salaries and benefits that they say would keep them from fleeing the state. Terry Moe, a Stanford political scientist and often a critic of teachers 9 unions, said on Monday that West Virginia teachers were not asking for anything radical. ,  cA 5 percent raise is not much, he said. cThere 9s a good case to be made that West Virginia ought to put more priority on education, and they 9re not. , President Trump has suggested one way teachers could earn more 4 [by agreeing to become armed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/politics /trump-guns-school-shootings.html), in order to protect students from school shootings, like the one that killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., last month. , Ms. Hilliard 9s school, Spring Mills High School, has had drills and lockdowns to prepare faculty and students for threats such as a potential school gunman. Recently the school ran a ccode red drill that she thought was real, because teachers were not warned in advance. cIt was nothing short of terrifying, she said. ,  cOur job descriptions are expanding, said Ms. Hilliard, who opposes the idea of arming teachers, which West Virginia currently does not allow. ,  cIt becomes 8Lay down your life if you have to. 9 ] ",

These debates [for and against free speech](https://pen.org/and-campus-for- all-diversity-inclusion-and-free-speech-at-u-s-universities/) focus largely on what citizens and policymakers ought to do. They take a normative stance on the question of freedom of speech. In [recently published research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-018-9444-x), however, we tried to see whether there is an empirical link between a climate of support for freedom of speech and indicators of the frequency of debate and dissent. In doing so, our goal is to test whether freedom of speech does in fact help to bolster\\xa0democratic vitality. **Here 9s how we did our research** We begin by measuring support for the principle of freedom of speech in American communities. We used public opinion data from the Freedom and Tolerance surveys, which are nationally representative surveys of the U.S. public, conducted every year between 2007 and 2011. The relevant survey questions focus on the broader concept of cpolitical tolerance 4 the degree to which citizens will support the extension of civil liberties to all, including those who advocate viewpoints that are highly disagreeable to respondents. The first set of questions focuses on people 9s support for civil liberties in general: whether citizens should have to carry around a national identity card at all times, whether high school teachers should be required to defend U.S. policies, whether the government should be allowed to monitor telephone calls and emails to prevent terrorist or criminal acts, and whether law enforcement officials should be allowed to use racial profiling and investigate non-violent protesters. The second set of questions asks if a group that the respondent strongly dislikes should be allowed to make a speech in the community, run for office, or hold a public rally. We combine responses to these eight questions into a single index of political tolerance. _[[ Is democracy in a worldwide decline? Nope. Here 9s our data. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/15/is-democracy- in-a-worldwide-decline-we-measured-it-heres-what-we-found/)]_ Although our pooled survey data set is fairly large, with around 4,000 respondents, it is not large enough to allow us to split the data by respondents 9 communities of residence. Instead, we apply a method known as [multilevel regression with poststratification](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey- cage/wp/2017/06/13/this-new-polling-method-predicted-trumps-win-while-we-were- testing-it) to the pooled survey data. This enables us to reliably measure support for freedom of speech and other civil liberties in 365 U.S. metropolitan areas. As you can see below, the map shows some surprising findings. Major metropolitan areas, such as New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Chicago/Naperville/Elgin, are not particularly supportive of free speech and civil liberties. The most tolerant metro areas are instead college towns such as Boulder, Colo.; Ithaca, N.Y.; and Corvallis, Ore. As [previous research on tolerance](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3088421) in the states has found, regional patterns are also evident, with tolerance predominating in the upper Midwest and Mountain West, and intolerance in the South. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jPPiGqseDmka1d95qo_jp05DZV8=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QA2X7UVRQQ2F7KXQ5Z3WZSSG64.png)  Next, to measure dissent in these metropolitan areas, we used data on protest incidence from the [GDELT project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), which uses software to scan news media for stories on political events. We counted the number of protests recorded by GDELT in each metropolitan area between 2007 and 2011. We divided this by the population of each metro area, and used it as a measure of publicly expressed dissent in that area. **More support for freedom of speech is associated with more public protests. But which comes first?** As you can see in the figure below, the rate of protest increases in step with the level of a metropolitan areas 9 political tolerance. ![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pKst9bPSoP3u4--k08eqLKi6C2k=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PHFVR5XPU4OFLTX3V3IMLRS4M.png)  But this doesn 9t tell us why they are associated with one another. Which comes first? Does support for freedom of speech and other civil liberties lead to more protest, or does protesting [\\xa0increase political tolerance](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106591290305600301)? Do they reinforce one another, or is there some other relationship between the two that makes the same area more likely to host both? To help us find out, we use a regression model to adjust for other factors that might affect the rate of protest, such as the ideological leaning and proportion of students in the area. Even accounting for those factors, we found that tolerance and protest are closely related. We then examined whether this association between tolerance and protest holds when we take the rate of protest in the preceding years into account. It does. Ultimately, although our data do not allow us to firmly conclude that tolerant metropolitan areas cause increased rates of protest, higher political tolerance and higher rates of protest are closely linked. _[[ Republicans and Democrats both say they support democratic freedoms 4 but that the other side doesn 9t ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/03/both-republicans-and-democrats-say-they-support- democratic-freedoms-but-that-the-other-side-doesnt)]_ These findings are consistent with earlier [research](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1964224) showing that Americans living in politically tolerant neighborhoods feel freer to engage in public expression of politics. What 9s especially interesting is that African Americans living in neighborhoods more tolerant of racist speech also [feel greater freedom to express themselves politically](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096262989500055F). _[[ One year after the Women 9s March on Washington, people are still protesting en masse.

If this is true, it would support a classic argument for freedom of speech and political tolerance more generally: that it encourages all views to be expressed.

      "article": "[  Marijuana derailed running back Ricky Williams 9s NFL career, but now the same drug may help launch the next phase of his business career. Williams, 40, is launching a cannabis brand called Real Wellness by Ricky Williams. The line will cater to health-conscious consumers, particularly women, who are interested in using alternative medicine to boost wellness, he said. Williams is serving as brand ambassador and using his studies of herbs and ancient medicine to create formulations for products. ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGobUPKRysPs/v0/60x-1.jpg) Ricky Williams playing for the Miami Dolphins Photographer: Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images  cWe 9re taking the idea of medicinal marijuana to the next step, he said. cCannabis is real and it 9s here, and a lot of people have no idea what they 9re doing. I have a lot of experience and a lot of knowledge from my experiences and my studies to share.     A former Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Texas, Williams played 12 seasons in the National Football League, mostly for the Miami Dolphins and New Orleans Saints. He retired in 2004 after testing positive for marijuana and returned the following year, only to fail another drug test and get suspended for the entire 2006 season. He played on and off before retiring for good after the 2011 season.  Willie, Snoop Williams isn 9t the first celebrity with a stoner reputation to join the newly legal cannabis industry. Country music legend Willie Nelson, comic duo Cheech & Chong and rapper Snoop Dogg have all launched brands. The legal industry is slated to reach $50 billion by 2026, up from $6 billion in 2016, according to investment bank Cowen & Co. After retiring, Williams said he distanced himself from marijuana, finding that people didn 9t want to work with him because of his reputation. Then in late 2015, he was persuaded to speak on a panel with other former football players at a cannabis conference in Phoenix.  cThe reception I got there opened my eyes to, 8I don 9t have to keep my marijuana life so private, 9 he said in an interview.     Williams says his decision was reinforced by the evolving public perception of marijuana. Sixty-four percent of the U.S. population now wants to make pot legal, according to a Gallup poll released in October.     Still, it took time to find a partner he was comfortable with. Williams wanted to use his training as an herbalist and healer to develop better medicinal products, and he didn 9t just want to put his name on a product he didn 9t care about. He wanted to leave those types of endorsements behind with his football career.  cFor the most part, it 9s Pepsi or Nike or a big company courts you and then says, 8We want you to support our brand, 9 he said. cThat never felt very good to me.  Ancient Medicine When he met Lincoln Fish, the chief executive officer of OutCo, a cannabis company in the San Diego area, Fish offered to pair Williams with scientists at OutCo to develop targeted herbal formulations, Williams said. Together they created six products in three categories: Solutions, Everyday and Sport. The vape cartridges, salves and tonics will go on shelves in five dispensaries in San Diego at 1:50 p.m. on Tuesday, an exact time chosen by Williams based on his study of astrology, according to a statement. Williams is hoping to use cannabis to bridge the gap between his former life as an athlete and the career he now wants as a healer, he said. He has studied ancient Indian medicine, yoga, massage, pranic healing and craniosacral therapy. He is currently learning Chinese medicine in Santa Monica, California.  cThe whole purpose of this for me is to help facilitate my public persona transitioning from being a former football player to being a healer, he said. cIt 9s been difficult for people to appreciate who I am as a healer because of the success I had as a football player.  ] ",

The accessibility of \"high quality education\" was an important factor, she noted. \"When I can look at your zip code and I can tell you are going to get a good education, can I really say, 'It doesn't matter where you came from, it matters where you're going?'\" she said. ] ",

(Screen grab from Fox News video) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos took to social media Monday to defend herself after she was hit with a tsunami of criticism for her performance during an interview on CBS 9s c60 Minutes. DeVos published a few tweets saying c60 Minutes had failed to include information about schools in Michigan, the secretary 9s home state, that she had provided. CBS did not immediately respond to a query about her tweets. On Sunday night, DeVos was interviewed by veteran correspondent Lesley Stahl, who repeatedly challenged the education secretary on her views.\\xa0DeVos said, for example, she had not cintentionally visited an underperforming school and Stahl suggested that perhaps the secretary\\xa0should. (DeVos responded, cMaybe I should. d) DeVos said billions upon billions of federal dollars had gone to waste in the public education system, another point Stahl said was not true. _[[ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stumbles during pointed 860 Minutes 9 interview ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2018/03/12/education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60 -minutes-interview/?utm_term=.a02689bdcf04)]_ Critics took to social media to lambaste DeVos 4 a Michigan billionaire who never attended or sent her children to a public school 4 for stumbling over some of her answers about basic education issues. _[[ 8Is this a freaking SNL skit?!!!!! 9 4 and more reaction to Betsy DeVos 9s rocky interview on 960 Minutes 9 ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/12/is-this-a -freaking-snl-skit-and-more-reaction-to-betsy-devoss-rocky-interview- on-60-minutes/?utm_term=.e87753acc247)]_ DeVos was back on television Monday, on a few different channels, talking about a new role President Trump has given her: leading a commission on school safety. The White House said it was setting up the Federal Commission on School Safety and would begin helping states to provide crigorous firearms training to some teachers to help prevent or stop campus shootings. After her morning television interviews, DeVos repaired to Twitter to take issue with one part of the CBS interview. It involved the performance of public schools in Michigan, DeVos 9s home state and the place where DeVos had spent decades and millions of dollars to encourage the spread of charter schools 4 which are publicly funded but privately run. She had less success in pushing vouchers 4 which use public money for private and religious school tuition 4 in the state. Part of the conversation went like this: > DEVOS: cWell, in places where there have been, where there is, a lot of choice that 9s been introduced, Florida, for example, the studies show that when there 9s a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually, the results get better, as well. > > STAHL: cNow, has that happened in Michigan? We 9re in Michigan. This is your home state. > > DEVOS: cYes, well, there 9s lots of great options and choices for students here. > > STAHL: cHave the public schools in Michigan gotten better? > > DEVOS: cI don 9t know. Overall, I,\\xa0 I can 9t say overall that they have all gotten better. > > STAHL: cThe whole state is not doing well. > > DEVOS: cWell, there are certainly lots of pockets where this, the students are doing well and . . . > > STAHL: cNo, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. > > DEVOS: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. > > STAHL: cThe public schools here are doing worse than they did. > > DEVOS: cMichigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. > > STAHL: cHave you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they 9re doing? > > DEVOS: cI have not, I have not, I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. > > STAHL: cMaybe you should. > > DEVOS: cMaybe I should. Yes. On Monday afternoon, DeVos tweeted the following, saying that c60 Minutes had left out some information she had provided: > Here 9s what we shared with [@60Minutes](https://twitter.com/60Minutes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), which of course they didn 9t show you: Michigan, like much of the nation, isn 9t doing well enough to prepare students. Scores are stagnant. Students need more options, and we must rethink our approach to education.

Nobody mentioned the charts she cited in her tweet, comparing Michigan standardized test scores to national averages. But it is unclear why DeVos thought they should have been used by Stahl. The c60 Minutes correspondent noted that Michigan schools were not doing well. DeVos also tweeted this: > Also missing from [@60Minutes](https://twitter.com/60Minutes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): students at charter schools in Detroit are doing 2x better than their peers. The reforms are helping, but there 9s so much more to do. We must help all students be better prepared for strong futures. <https://t.co/nZ8iqHhLBd> [pic.twitter.com/xoiegl2VF1](https://t.co/xoiegl2VF1) > > 4 Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVosED) [March 12, 2018](https://twitter.com/BetsyDeVosED/status/973272217734742016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Again, it 9s unclear why DeVos thought this should have been highlighted. It 9s worth noting that during DeVos 9s confirmation hearing before the Senate education committee in January 2017, she said, cI believe there is a lot that has gone right in Detroit and Michigan with regard to charter schools. Sen. Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) noted that charter performance in Detroit was nothing to brag about.  cDetroit Public Schools averaged 9 percent 4 9 percent of kids are proficient, Bennett said. cCharter schools were a little better, 14 percent of the kids were proficient. I will stipulate that charter schools are doing better, but that is a horrible outcome for everybody involved. > .[@BetsyDeVosED](https://twitter.com/BetsyDeVosED?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) on [@foxandfriends](https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): cWe 9re going to advance ways in which schools can be made safer for students. <https://t.co/NHsiHnrCbS> [pic.twitter.com/E9ZWBINT4m](https://t.co/E9ZWBINT4m) > > 4 Fox News (@FoxNews) [March 12, 2018](https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/973161716153487361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ] ",
