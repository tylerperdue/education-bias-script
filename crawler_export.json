        "article": "  **GREEN**  By Sam Graham-Felsen  301 pp. Random House. $27. ,  cGreen, the debut novel from Sam Graham-Felsen, who was chief blogger for Barack Obama 9s 2008 presidential campaign, chronicles the middle school travails of an anomalous variety of minority student. cI am the white boy at the Martin Luther King Middle, is how 12-year-old David Alexander Greenfeld, nicknamed Green, introduces himself in the novel 9s opening line. Martin Luther King Middle is a Boston public school 4 cmad ghetto, in Green 9s estimation 4 where his progressive parents have sent him for sixth grade. He 9s not the only white boy in the school, but the other one 4 his friend Kev, who 9s got lip scruff and spiky black hair along with prowess on the basketball court 4 often passes for Puerto Rican. There 9s no mistaking Green, though: not with his blue eyes and blond curls and constantly flushed cheeks, not with his monogrammed L. L. Bean backpack, not with his weakness for blurting the word cawesome ( ca Caucasian catastrophe, he notes). Almost all 12-year-olds are confused about who and what they are, but for David Greenfeld, at school, one conspicuous facet of his identity defines him: not his Green-ness, but his whiteness. , Hewing to the classic coming-of-age-novel formula, cGreen 9s Green experiences a variety of awakenings 4 sexual, religious, familial, moral and not surprisingly racial 4 during the course of his sixth-grade school year (1992-93), all of which get relayed in first-person, present- tense, slanged-up narration. The alarm clock for some of these awakenings is the friendship Green strikes with Marlon Wellings, a pious, studious black classmate who lives near Green in the Robert Gould Shaw Homes, a.k.a. cthe projects. Marlon, unlike Green, is mostly immune to social tensions, sitting by himself at lunchtime studying for the entrance exam to Boston Latin, the city 9s elite public school, where Green also aims to transfer. Green 9s first impression is that Marlon clooks pretty soft, and thus approachable: ccreased khakis, pilled-up flannel, boxy black shoes and a short, unkempt flattop, more like a clumpy cloud. He has a gap in his front teeth, just as Green does, but the similarities don 9t end there. The bond they form is based partly upon a clandestine love for the Boston Celtics 4 cno one openly admits they feel the Celtics anymore, Green says 4 and partly upon their shared desire for an upward move to Boston Latin. At Martin Luther King Middle they 9re outsiders, and both of them are desperate to get even farther outside. , The similarities do, however, bear some obvious endpoints. Green 9s Birkenstock-shod parents went to Harvard before embarking on a life of bobo activism ( cPops gives mad loot to Greenpeace d); Marlon 9s father is somewhere down South while his grandmother cares for him along with his mentally ill mother. Green and his 8-year-old brother, Benno, spend summers helping their parents tend a community garden plot; Marlon eats asparagus for the first time at Green 9s house and the resultant urine smell triggers a cancer panic. Green is a secular Jew, confounded by what that even means, while Marlon sings in the choir in a storefront church near the Roxbury border. Green 9s parents, if they would relax their principles, could conceivably send him to a safer private school (brother Benno, who recently stopped speaking, attends one such school cfor sensitive kids d); Marlon 9s grandmother is absent that option. And Marlon is black, while Green, glaringly, is white. , This dynamic 4 the white boy adrift in the urban and predominantly black school, the fraught cross-racial friendship that blooms there 4 isn 9t new to fiction. Jonathan Lethem probed it, with exquisite grace, in his 2003 novel cThe Fortress of Solitude. (A line from Lethem 9s novel, in fact, could serve as a 10-word summary of Green: cA white boy in sixth grade, squirming in the glare. d) Graham-Felsen isn 9t reaching for the same lofty heights as Lethem did (few novelists dare to), but he is reaching in the same general direction: toward the terribly thorny beauty at the heart of cross-racial friendships, which constitutes, per Leslie Fiedler and others, one of our essential American stories. These thorns keep getting denser and sharper as cGreen progresses, as when Green discovers that the pair 9s snow shoveling business is successful only when he approaches potential customers without Marlon in sight. What we call racism Green apprehends as cthe force d: its energies everywhere, cworking on everyone, himself included. When Green copies a couple of answers from Marlon during the fated entrance exam, the white proctor takes notice but lets it slide. cA sickening mix of relief and shame sweeps over me, says Green. cMar knows it and I do, too: I 9ve been saved by the force. , Moments like these 4 rendered subtly, without poster-size messaging 4 are when cGreen is at its most prickly and compelling. Scenes of innocence 4 Green and Marlon clowning in homemade pro-wrestler costumes, or watching VHS tapes of Larry Bird-era Celtics games from inside a living room fort made of blankets and chairs 4 serve as their delicately calibrated counterbalances, affecting in their sweetness but credible in their lack of saccharine. Graham-Felsen lets boys be boys: messy-brained, impulsive, goatish, self-centered, outwardly gutsy but often inwardly terrified. The voice with which Graham-Felsen equips Green, overseasoned with hip-hop slang, is the epitome of this. At first blush it suggests Holden Caulfield as translated by Vanilla Ice ( cIf I 9m gonna make another attempt to kick it to her, I 9m gonna need a new Machine, and for that I 9m gonna need to fatten my muenster stack, fast d). Yet as the novel advances, and this street stud pose starts splintering, the voice itself gathers a kind of dorky poignancy, the reader sensing an unseen wobble upon Green 9s stiff, pale lip. Is it linguistic blackface, with all that implies, or a 12-year- old 9s guileless attempt to cobble together a voice of his own from what 9s nearest at hand? cI wish I had what he has, Green says of Marlon at one point. He 9s talking about religion, but it could be identity or maybe identity 9s midwife, community. cAll I came up with was confusion. , Yet this reader found himself wishing for something of Marlon 9s, too: _his_ awakenings, _his_ perspective, _his_ inner voice, _his_ fullness on the page. As Lethem wrote in cThe Fortress of Solitude d: cThe white kid has one set of feelings, the black kid another. That we aren 9t privy to those feelings owes less to malpractice than to the inherent limitations of Graham-Felsen telling this story through Green 9s blue eyes. Marlon only exists within Green 9s purview, which means that cGreen 4 and by extension the reader 4 sees only a fraction of the whole. cWe match up in a million soft little ways 4 why can 9t we just be boys again? Green laments near the end, when the friendship has run aground. cBut the more I think about it, the more I wonder if we were meant to be shards from the start. Not just me and Mar 4 everyone. Look around. \\u2026 The force is everywhere, prying us apart. There 9s more hopefulness than this by the final pages, but it 9s a long-shot hope, a coin into a fountain. He and Marlon match up in a million ways save one, but that one, in America then as now, seems cursed to outweigh all the others.  ",

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News) Virtually nowhere in the United States do black boys grow up to earn incomes equivalent to white boys raised in the same neighborhoods by parents with comparable wealth and education levels, according to a study released Monday(http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/) that followed millions of children now in their late 30s or turning 40.\\xa0 The disparity holds true even for black boys raised in the wealthiest of families, who grew up on the same block in the same affluent community and attended the same school as their white counterparts. The findings shows that race -- not just parental income or neighborhood opportunities -- factors into the yawning wealth gap(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and- hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind- whites/?utm_term=.39a115133188) between blacks and whites in America. In addition to income, black boys were more likely to be incarcerated and less likely to attend college than their white counterparts from families of similar income level.  cRace matters, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist who co- authored\\xa0the paper with Raj Chetty at Stanford and two researchers with the U.S. Census Bureau. cParent income and neighborhoods cannot explain the entirety of the black-white gap. Even when your parents get rich, the gaps don 9t go away. The gap actually increased at the upper end of the income spectrum, a finding that surprised the researchers. In 99 percent of U.S. Census tracts, white boys grew up to earn more than black boys. The average gap for individual wages was about $9,000 for men from low-income families, Hendren said. That gap widened to an average of roughly $11,000 for men from affluent families. Among the wealthiest families, black sons of millionaires typically earned an individual annual income of between $40,000 and $45,000 at age 35, while white sons of millionaires earned between $50,000 and $55,000, Hendren said. The household income gap was wider and was largely explained by the higher marriage rates among whites, he said.  cThe racial divide is something that permeates the backyards of every community in America, in both affluent and poorer neighborhoods, Hendren said. cIn fact, the gap is even larger in affluent neighborhoods with better schools. The income disparity was driven entirely by men, researchers found -- with the gap virtually erased for women raised by parents of similar income levels. Black and white women with comparable family backgrounds grew up to attend college at near identical levels, worked similar hours, and earned closely equivalent wages. Both black and white daughters of millionaires earned an average of around $38,500 a year at age 35. Boys born into high-income black families were much more likely to experience downward economic mobility than similarly situated whites across generations, the study said. A black child born to parents in the top 20th percentile of the income distribution was as likely to fall to the bottom quintile as he was to remain in the top. But white boys\\xa0were\\xa0nearly five times as likely to remain in the top quintile as they were to fall to the bottom. As for what accounts for the disparities in upward mobility, the researchers do not have a clear answer. Social scientists and policy makers have suggested better educational opportunities, even marriage, as the key. But neither explains the intergenerational income gap between black and white children from similar backgrounds. In the neighborhoods with low poverty rates where the gap is smallest, researchers identified two common traits: black fathers were more likely to be present in the communities and racial bias among whites, as measured by online psychological tests, was lower. The presence of black fathers predicted the outcome of black boys regardless of whether a boy 9s own father was present. But less than 5 percent of black children grow up in low-poverty environments with more than half of black fathers present, the study found, whereas 63 percent of white children are raised in communities with a high presence of white fathers. Researchers suggested several policy considerations to close the intergenerational gap, including moving black families to better neighborhoods or replicating those conditions across the country with mentoring programs for black boys and efforts to reduce racial bias among whites. The study relied upon newly available longitudinal Census data covering nearly the entire U.S. population between 1989 and 2015 as well as federal tax returns. Researchers followed a cohort of 20 million children born in the U.S. between 1978 and 1983 or legal immigrants who came to the country as children.  ",

        "article": " Want to witness the tectonic shifts underway in American politics? Consider women and college graduates, who have flocked to the Democratic Party in recent years. , A larger share of college graduates identify as or lean Democratic than at any point in the past quarter-century, according to a new Pew Research Center report(http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing- educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/) based on more than 10,000 interviews with registered voters last year. The data tell a similar story for women, too. , Republicans have gained some ground, too, among older registered voters and those with a high school education or less. , Here 9s a brief look at the findings of the Pew analysis, which was released this week. , Americans are more divided along educational lines than at any point in about a quarter-century, according to Pew. , That 9s thanks largely to a realignment among two groups: those with only a high school diploma and those who have completed college. , In 1992, 55 percent of registered voters with no more than a high school education identified or leaned toward the Democratic Party, while only 37 percent sided with Republicans. Today, the group shows a slight preference for the Republican Party. , The exact opposite is true for Americans with at least a college degree, whose slight preference for Republicans in 1992 has since flipped. Today, about 58 percent side with Democrats, and only 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party. , That divergence was most pronounced among registered voters who had pursued a postgraduate education: Once split in their political preferences, they are now twice as likely to align with Democrats as with Republicans. , Women have long been more likely to side with the Democratic Party than with Republicans, but the gap in preference expanded in recent years, to 19 percentage points in 2017 from 12 points in 2015. , Most of that growth, however, comes not from women who now identify as Democrats, but those who find themselves leaning toward the party, according to Pew. , And the gap is widest among millennial women, who are three times as likely to identify or lean Democratic as Republican: In 2017, 70 percent of millennial women sided with Democrats, while just 23 percent preferred Republicans. , That gap is more than two times as large as it was in 2014. , But not all women have moved toward the Democrats. Support for Republicans has steadily risen among women in the Silent Generation, defined by Pew as those born from 1928 to 1945. Today, 48 percent of those women side with Republicans, while 46 percent align with Democrats.  ",

Phase Eight said the figure did not reflect the \"true story\" of the business as most male employees are in higher-paid head office roles rather than in shops.

In late 2015, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, the NCLB successor law that gave states some flexibility about how they could devise systems that would hold districts accountable for meeting student performance requirements in ESSA. So what are states doing? Are they taking advantage of that flexibility to back away from the worst parts of No Child Left Behind? Each state plan must be approved by the U.S. Education Department, and so far 33 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have seen their blueprints approved. Democrats in the Senate have expressed concern about the approvals, saying that the department is giving states a pass to do what they what 4 regardless of whether the accountability plans comply with ESSA. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), head of the Senate Education Committee, has praised the department in this regard. In this post, Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair & Open Testing(http://www.fairtest.org), a nonprofit group\\xa0known as FairTest that works to end the abuse of standardized tests, analyzes the first 16 state plans that were approved by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. _ Efforts to reduce standardized testing succeeded in many school districts in 2017. Here 9s why and how. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/06/efforts-to-reduce-standardized-testing-succeeded- in-many-school-districts-in-2017-heres-why-and-how/?utm_term=.6aa8dc282d94)_ _**By Monty Neill**_ Have states taken advantage of the new federal education law 9s flexibility on accountability to overcome the destructive legacy of No Child Left Behind (NCLB)? A just-completed review of the first 16 approved state Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plans by the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (http://www.fairtest.org)shows limited progress. Most positively, 10 of the 16 states abandoned NCLB 9s failed test-and- punish policies, such as firing staff or closing or privatizing schools for low standardized exam scores. On the other hand, states have not taken sufficient advantage of ESSA 9s opportunities to improve assessment and accountability. If every state adopted the best practices pioneered by some jurisdictions, U.S. public schools could make faster progress toward developing helpful, not harmful, accountability systems. The FairTest analysis examined five basic components of state ESSA plans and considered three other related issues. You can find additional detail and recommendations in our report and state-by-state chart, available here(http://fairtest.org/State-ESSA-Plans-Report-2018) and below. Here are findings from a review of these states: Arizona, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont. 1) **_States have selected a narrow range of school quality/student success indicators, many of which are standardized test scores._** _States should develop a richer array of indicators_. A few states include factors such as adequate funding, school climate, student or parent engagement, reductions in punitive discipline, access to a well-rounded curriculum, and access to resources such as counselors, librarians and wraparound services for students and families. 2) **_Most states give much less weight to school quality/student success than they should_. ** Combined with the narrow range of indicators, this means states remain too heavily focused on reading/English language arts and math test scores. As a result, schools will continue to feel pressure to focus on test preparation, to the detriment of a richer education. _States should increase the weight of school quality/student success indicators,_ such as those listed above, to at least 40 percent, as a few states have done, in addition to broadening the indicators. (ESSA requires that non-school quality/student success indicators should have csignificantly greater weighting than school quality/student success indicators.) 3)\\xa0 ** _Many states have created school ranking categories or levels beyond the three required by ESSA._** The required categories are schools in need of comprehensive (schoolwide) support and improvement (CSI), those in need of targeted (to groups of students) support and improvement (TSI), and all others. Of the 16 states, six require only three levels, three have four levels, and six use five levels. (Most states using five levels rank schools with a letter grade of A through F.) Levels will perpetuate unhealthy competition because the primary factor for determining a school 9s level remains standardized tests. Schools may focus narrowly on boosting test scores to cbeat other schools, thereby undermining a richer curriculum. _States with more than three levels should cut back to just three._ 4) **_Six of the 16 states retain some of NCLB 9s punitive sanctions_ , **though most of them do so only if initial improvement efforts have not succeeded after about three years 4 which is too short a time span. The remaining 10 states plan to provide assistance to struggling schools. If that is unsuccessful, they will increase the assistance, rather than impose punishments, as NCLB required. **_This is the most positive finding from FairTest 9s review_.** _States should abandon punitive NCLB mandates._ If after six years serious problems remain, states should determine why they persist and intervene appropriately. 5) **_Some states attach punitive consequences to ESSA 9s requirement that schools test 95 percent of their students with federally mandated state exams._** The U.S. Department of Education expects states to factor participation into state plans and school ratings. This means a good school could be put in a lower level, even identified at different levels of needing improvement (CSI or TSI), if more than 5 percent of students opt out of testing. Further, 14 of the 16 states mandate additional actions. In eight, it means only a plan to improve participation or some unspecified intervention. But in six the state will do such things as lower a school 9s ranking by a level, even if it has already dropped once due to insufficient participation. _This goes beyond ESSA requirements and punishes schools for the actions of parents._ _States should do no more than report the 95 percent participation rate._ They should not penalize schools placed in lower levels because of opt-out percentages. Louisiana plans no further actions. New York and New Jersey will calculate average scores based only on actual test takers and use that data in deciding support and interventions. Colorado and Utah are also seeking to be non-punitive. (New York, New Jersey, Colorado and Utah have had strong opt-out movements.) 6) **_New Hampshire intends to rely heavily on performance assessments,_ ** expanding a pilot project in which local assessments can be used instead of state tests in all but three grades. (See cAssessment Matters: Constructing Model State Systems to Replace Testing Overkill, at <http://www.fairtest.org/assessment-matters-constructing-model-state-system>.) Other states may choose to go this route via ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot. _States should prepare for participation in ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot_ and encourage districts to implement teacher-led performance assessing. 7) **_States do not go beyond ESSA 9s requirement to report school finance data, including per-student expenditures, to say what they will do if funding is inadequate._** The reporting will shed light on inadequate resources, a fundamental problem for many schools. However, _states are not required to do anything substantive with this information_. Failure to address this problem leaves states off the hook for funding equity and adequacy. _States should go beyond ESSA requirements to mandate that funding data be included in a school 9s needs assessment_ _and that states commit to addressing inadequate funding._ 8) **_State plans are insufficiently complete about how they will tally standardized exam volumes and track consequences._** ESSA requires reporting on what standardized tests states, districts and schools administer. It also authorizes use of its funds to conduct state and district audits of the amount of testing. _States should conduct_ _audits and monitor districts and schools to ensure they publicly report all standardized tests they administer._ FairTest 9s analysis concludes that education policymakers as well as reform advocates should model their own plans on elements of other states 9 federally approved plans that take advantage of ESSA flexibility. States should adopt a rich array of indicators, minimize the use of test scores, then weight school quality/student success indicators at 40 percent or more. They can sort schools into just three levels. They can include funding adequacy in needs assessments, then move their state to provide sufficient resources to all schools. States can drop punitive sanctions and focus on genuine assistance. States can also refuse to add penalties for low test participation. Some states may be reluctant to take these steps. In that case, advocates, from parent and community organizations to unions and professional associations, will need to exert pressure to win meaningful assessment reforms.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump 9s Education Department is on its way to delaying by two years the implementation of an Obama-era rule that is intended to address the disparities in the treatment of students of color with disabilities. The rule amended regulations that are part of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). John King, the U.S. education secretary in December 2016, said then: > cChildren with disabilities are often disproportionately and unfairly suspended and expelled from school and educated in classrooms separate from their peers. Children of color with disabilities are overrepresented within the special education population, and the contrast in how frequently they are disciplined is even starker. Current Education Secretary Betsy Devos is not a fan of the rule, and last month, the Education Department published a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment on a proposal to delay the rule 9s implementation, which was supposed to start in the 2018-2019 school year. The notice says the department wants to make this move to ensure the rule 9s ceffectiveness can be ensured. The cEquity in IDEA rule is just one of a number of Obama-era regulations\\xa0 aimed at protecting the rights of students that the Trump administration has either rolled back or expressed interest in doing so. In this post, a special education expert explains why delaying the rule 4\\xa0 is such a bad idea. It was written by Catherine Kramarczuk Voulgarides, an assistant professor of special education at Touro College in New York City. She has a book coming out in April of 2018 entitled: cDoes Compliance Matter in Special Education? IDEA and the Hidden Inequities of Practice.  (https://www.tcpress.com/does-compliance-matter-in-special- education-9780807759011) _ DeVos moves to delay Obama-era rule on minority special-education students (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/02/26/devos- delaying-obama-era-rule-on-minority-special-education- students/?utm_term=.d0626c1d127b)_ By Catherine Kramarczuk Voulgarides Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is moving to impose a two-year delay on the Equity in IDEA(https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-equity- idea) rules, which would have gone into effect in July 2018.\\xa0 The delay in implementation will, at best, promote the status quo in special education 4 which has been characterized by decades of racialized outcomes in the placement, classification, and/or discipline of students with disabilities 4 or will exacerbate these inequities. The department stated its reasons for the proposed delay in the Federal Register\\xa0 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102 /assistance-to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities- preschool-grants-for-children)on Feb. 27, 2018, but minimized the civil-rights issue that is central to disproportionality in special education. Students of color 4 primarily Native American, black, and Latino students 4 have historically been marginalized in the United State education system through questionable special education placement, classification, and/or disciplinary outcomes as compared to their white counterparts. Minimizing the civil-rights issue that is at the heart of disproportionality is a mistake. One reason provided in the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)that justifies a delay states: > cThe Department lacks the statutory authority under IDEA to require States to use a standard methodology to determine significant disproportionality, pointing out as well that the Department 9s previous position, adopted in the 2006 regulations implementing the 2004 amendments to IDEA, was that States are in the best position to evaluate factors affecting determinations of significant disproportionality. While the logic surrounding state rights is deeply tied to the educational federalism that influences our educational system, it does not engage with the gravity of the civil-rights concerns that are associated with racially disproportionate outcomes. It is not a coincidence that racial disparities in special education mirror broader educational opportunity gaps. The history, tenor, and reality of race relations in the United States infiltrates each school building and classroom of this nation. And it manifests, whether explicitly or not, in our day-to-day educational practices. Denying this reality by not labeling disproportionality as a civil-rights concern does a disservice to our youth. And a focus on preserving states 9 rights fails to recognize how the historical conditions and realities of schooling in the United States, and the resulting interactional and structural opportunity gaps, have systematically disadvantaged Native American, black, and Latino students. Relying upon a racially neutral policy approach that preserves state rights will not sufficiently counter these inequities. And yes, while there are qualitative differences between the educational climate, context, and needs of students in rural Montana, versus Atlanta, versus Philadelphia, versus Seattle,\\xa0 versus Tucson 4 to name a few 4 it is also a fact that each of these locales is linked to a broader American history characterized by a legacy of racial discrimination and institutional racism that has severely limited educational access and opportunity to primarily Native American, Black, and Latinx students in schools across the United States. The state rights argument also defies the findings (http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1044207311407917)and suggestions of both policy and research reports which have shown that when states have latitude to decide upon how they will identify and address disproportionality, the issue is not resolved and it seems to cexist in some states more so than others. For example,\\xa0 a 2013 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-137)found that out of the 356 districts identified as having significant disproportionality, chalf of these districts were clustered in five states and 73 were in Louisiana alone. The report further said that the way csome states defined overrepresentation made it unlikely that any districts would be identified within these states. This is perplexing. Do the findings in the GAO report(https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-137) imply that only some states have issues with racial inequities in special education and others do not? This is hard to believe. Even harder to believe, the Federal Register notice alludes to these findings, but it still positions states 9 rights as a valid reason to delay the regulations. Another reason provided in the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)that justifies the delay points to a tension between the individualized spirit of IDEA and the call for an aggregate measure that identifies racially disproportionate outcomes. The Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)notice states: > The standard methodology for significant disproportionality improperly looks at group outcomes through statistical measures rather than focusing on what is at the foundation of IDEA, namely the needs of each individual child and on the appropriateness of individual identifications, placements, or discipline. Essentially, the language reads as if tracking an aggregate outcome (such as disproportionality) is contradictory to the spirit of IDEA, which is focused on providing a continuum of educational services to students with disabilities through their respective Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). I have two critiques of this reasoning which highlight, again, how civil- rights concerns do not appear to be at the forefront of any decision to delay the Equity in IDEA(https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-equity- idea) rules. IDEA is governed by both IDEA statues and the logic of the 14th Amendment. These are both sources of federal rights that must be interpreted and implemented in schools and districts across the United States. Unfortunately though, although both race and disability are protected classes under the U.S. Constitution, only crace is subject to strict scrutiny. Disability status is not. Thus, remedying a problem such as disproportionality, which exists at the intersection of disability and race, is incredibly difficult to achieve under the current legal framework. It also highlights a very complex problem that has serious equity implications. In this 2017 article(https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4721&context=caselrev), Natasha Strassfeld states: > As state policy monitoring of disproportionality has been found to either inadequately define or find evidence of significant disproportionality across states, potential claimants have relied on litigation to show intentional discrimination. Plaintiffs, however, face an uphill battle in using school- and district-level placement data to prove intentional discrimination, even when policy monitoring under IDEA has led to a finding that significant disproportionality by race or ethnicity in special education and related services has occurred within the plaintiff 9s district. Essentially, it is very difficult to prove that educators, a school, and/or school district has/had an explicit intent to discriminate when disproportionate outcomes are present. And it is especially true when/if schools and school districts are able to show compliance with IDEA statutes. This leads to my second point, and the most consequential one yet in regards to civil-rights protections and IDEA. Arguably, when a school or school district can show that they have complied with IDEA and that there is no evidence of explicit discrimination, then a racialized outcome such as disproportionality cannot be the fault of educators, biases and beliefs, organizational systems, and/or historical and contextual conditions. This reasoning theoretically allows for unequal educational outcomes to be blamed on students and families because, under the guise of compliance with IDEA, educators are not explicitly discriminating against students of color labeled with a disability, even if racial inequities are present. Essentially, a student 9s lack of success in school becomes their own fault, an individual issue, rather than one that is related to broader systemic factors. Thus, arguing that a focus on a group-based outcome is counter to the individualized spirit of IDEA further reifies a deficit-based logic that holds students accountable for school failure, and no one else. This is conceptually dangerous. Didn 9t civil-rights legal strategies and the logic found in _Brown vs. Board of Education_ influence the legislative development of IDEA? _\\xa0_ Yes. Wasn 9t the disability rights movement a collective effort aimed at assuring that all students have equal access and opportunity to high quality educational services? Yes. If we sideline a collective concern like racial disproportionality, isn 9t this contrary to the spirit of IDEA? Yes, because the collective spirit of the legislation dissolves into an catomization of needs politics 4 as noted in this 2009 article(https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ887067) 4\\xa0 that upholds individual concerns over collective ones. In summary, we need to identify educational policy and practice remedies that seriously contend with the historical and social contexts that define the United States education system. If we don 9t, we exhibit a concerning historical amnesia that denies the salience of race in American society and on educational outcomes. This amnesia also promotes a form of complicit compliance with IDEA whereby we are able to comply with educational systems that, with very little effort on our part, continuously reproduce racialized outcomes without having to face any consequences. Because of this, it is not in the best interests of students across this country to be educated in schools and school districts that are not using a standardized measure to track racialized outcomes in special education.

        "article": "  Education protects white women from losing their babies in infancy. The more education they have, the lower the infant mortality rate. Strangely, though, it 9s the opposite for black women. The most educated face the greatest risk of having their children die at birth or in infancy. Stress from dealing with racism and sexism seems to be a key reason that highly educated black women are far more likely lose their babies than are equally educated white women, says Keisha\\xa0Bentley-Edwards, a co-author of a new report, which is titled cFighting at Birth: Eradicating the Black- White Infant Mortality Gap. The stress can lead to premature delivery of low birth-weight babies. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWAXZozJqUpQ/v0/60x-1.png) Duke University, Insight Center for Community Economic Development  cWhen you 9re the only black woman in the room, when you 9re often working in\\xa0elite circles where you are the first or you are the only, there is a toll to be paid, says Bentley-Edwards. Herself a\\xa0black woman with a doctorate, she is a professor of general internal medicine at Duke University, as well as associate research director at Duke 9s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity. The research was done in concert with the\\xa0Insight Center for Community Economic Development in Oakland, Calif.     The findings of cFighting at Birth aren 9t entirely new. Researchers have known for decades that black mothers 9\\xa0infant mortality rate is about twice that of white women, and that black women don 9t get the same protection from education and higher socioeconomic status that white women do. Even many black women who have attained high rank carry the legacy of a lifetime of struggle. Damage to the body from stress, known as cweathering, has wide-ranging health effects that may manifest themselves during pregnancy.     Bentley-Edwards says the report makes two contributions. It puts all the research together in what she calls a\\xa0 cdigestible form. And it advocates for solutions that the medical establishment has resisted. Bentley- Edwards says doctors and public-health officials tend to focus their efforts on\\xa0poor women, regardless of their race. That 9s a worthy effort, but it does nothing for black women who aren 9t poor but nonetheless\\xa0are at grave risk of losing their newborn babies.  cThis is a push for a policy that 9s directed at black women specifically, she says. The extremely high rate of infant mortality for black women with doctorates or professional degrees raises the question of whether there 9s a fluke in\\xa0the data. After all, there are relatively few black women with advanced degrees that give\\xa0birth in any given year, and far fewer whose babies die in infancy. But Bentley-Edwards says statistical tests confirmed the result. And even if the disparity is somewhat smaller on average than these numbers show, the overall problem has been repeatedly confirmed by other researchers. Bentley-Edwards says the report should not be taken as a message to black women to think twice about getting an advanced education. cWe have to attack the stressor, she says. cEliminate job discrimination. We need allies to step in when we see a black woman at work not being treated the way she should be. The woman shouldn 9t feel guilty that she 9s complicit. It 9s not the education that 9s doing it.     Infant mortality rates have fallen for all races over the decades, but the rate for black women overall has remained about twice that of white women overall. White American women have the same risk as women in New Zealand, while black American women have the same risk as women in Romania or Thailand. Black\\xa0American women are far more likely to give birth prematurely, which is a major risk factor for infant mortality. Differences remain, even after accounting for factors such as poverty, obesity, age of mother, and illegal drug use. A 2015 study(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-015-9687-2) in the _Annals of Behavioral Medicine_ by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Wisconsin, and Emory University looked at markers\\xa0of inflammation in the body and found that cthe health ramifications\\xa0of high anger, or poorly controlled anger, may be stronger\\xa0in African Americans with more, compared to less, education. Last year, the _International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ published an  article(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678200) by researchers at Tulane University and other institutions that included interviews with 18 black women who had lost their children in infancy. Some\\xa0said that they felt the medical establishment was insensitive to their loss. cI mean, we planned her. We wanted her, one said. Another said, cIt 9s like, 8No! We are human. We care about our well- being just like you do. 9 Even tennis star Serena Williams had problems\\xa0when she gave birth. In her case, the life in danger was hers, not her child 9s. She told _Vogue_ magazine(https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview- february-2018)\\xa0that when she insisted on a CT scan to check for blood clots, a nurse told her that her pain medicine might be confusing her. She insisted on the scan and was proven correct. cI was like, 8listen to Dr. Williams! 9 she said. ProPublica\\xa0and NPR News last year co-published a story(https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from- dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth) that likewise focused on the risk of childbirth to black women. According to the Centers for Disease Control, it said,\\xa0black mothers in the U.S. die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.  cFighting at Birth is more prescriptive about black infant mortality than most previous\\xa0studies. It recommends support for programs and advocacy groups for black mothers; protocols to minimize bias by health- care providers; enforcement of laws against discrimination against black women; increased social support for expectant black women; and encouragement of breastfeeding, among other fixes.\\xa0   ",

Many of the technologies in the film are invented or controlled by Shuri, the sister of T 9Challa, the Black Panther and Wakanda 9s king. Shuri, 16, plays a similar role to cQ from the James Bond films, providing her brother and the kingdom with vibranium-powered vehicles, weapons and other innovations. , In a statement, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, Robert A. Iger, said it was thrilling to see how much the technology in the film had excited young audiences. ,  cIt 9s fitting that we show our appreciation by helping advance STEM programs for youth, especially in underserved areas of the country, to give them the knowledge and tools to build the future they want, he said. , The $1 million pledged by Disney is only a fraction of the money that the film has brought in. In less than two weeks in theaters, cBlack Panther made more than $700 million worldwide(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/movies/black-panther-700 -million-globally-box-office.html), making it one of the fastest grossing films(https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/02/25/box-office- black-panther-tops-700m-with-record-breaking-2nd-weekend/618f2329213f) ever. , In a Twitter thread on Tuesday, the journalist Gene Demby, who writes and hosts a podcast about race for NPR, was dismissive of Disney 9s contribution, calling it(https://twitter.com/GeeDee215/status/968503958452035584) a crounding error. He wrote about how Disney has benefited from(https://twitter.com/GeeDee215/status/968497352863571968) enthusiasm about the merits of cBlack Panther and its representation of black people. , The Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a federated organization with independent clubs in cities around the country, said the money would be used to create new STEM innovation centers in 12 cities. (The acronym stands for science, technology, engineering and math.) Those cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Washington and Oakland, Calif., where the director of cBlack Panther, Ryan Coogler, was born and where some of the film takes place. , Chrissy Booth, the senior director of youth development programs for the organization, said the cities were target markets for Disney. The organization plans to evaluate critical need in those markets, as well as individual clubs 9 willingness to participate, before deciding which clubs in each city will receive the centers. , The organization 9s STEM curriculum gives young people the chance at an early age to have hands-on experiences, like building bridges and light bulbs and creating rock candy, Ms. Booth said. Children then move on to programs that focus on computer and environmental science and digital literacy. , The Boys & Girls Clubs worked with Partnerships in Education and Resilience, the education policy institute at Harvard University, and found that 12th graders in Boys and Girls Clubs were almost twice as likely than their peers to be interested in a STEM career. Fifty percent of girls who participated reported interest, compared with 12 percent of their peers nationwide. , Disney 9s donation imitates the end of the film (and in case it wasn 9t clear, **spoilers follow** ). Shuri and T 9Challa arrive in the United States, landing on a basketball court in Oakland. As a part of a new decree, T 9Challa places his sister in charge of global outreach around technology, giving underserved kids the chance to benefit from Wakanda 9s riches.  ",

That was the conclusion of a report from the Children's Commissioner,(https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/Growing-Up-North-March-2018-1.pdf) Anne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide?  There are varying levels of deprivation   There were higher proportions of children claiming free school meals(https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their- characteristics-january-2017) in the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017.    Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than \\xa37,400 a year excluding income from benefits.  * Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41983610) And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long- term, entrenched deprivation.  There are strong links between deprivation and how well children do at school The link between deprivation and how well children do at school(https://www.suttontrust.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/1Attainment_deprived_schools_summary.pdf) has been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a \"double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school\", she said.   * Northern children 'too often left behind'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43500164)   * Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38172816)  But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived.   He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. \"Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,\" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were \"overly impressed by schools' level of attainment\" rather than looking at children's progress.  * Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34964522) But even accounting for that, there are still regional differences when you look at how well schools are rated(https://public.tableau.com/profile/ofsted!/vizhome/Dataview/Viewregionalperformanceovertime) in the comparably deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber.  It's not as simple as north vs south In 2015, the government produced figures on multiple indices of deprivation(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465791 /English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Statistical_Release.pdf) looking at seven main things:   * Income   * Employment   * Health deprivation and disability   * Education, skills and training   * Barriers to housing and services   * Crime   * Living environment  And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as \"south=rich, north=poor\". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption East Jaywick in Essex came out as the most deprived town in England based on the government's multiple indices of deprivation  Is London a special case? Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country.   Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average.   But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government, starting from the mid- 1990s.(https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8006) In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment.  What about the money?   A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like:   * Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals   * Children in the care of the state   * Children with special education needs   * Children who speak English as an additional language   * Schools in areas with a high cost of living  The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving \\xa3500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.   ",

Dintersmith has taken a dramatically different path from other wealthy Americans who have become involved in education issues, departing from the approach of people such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who was a prime mover behind the Common Core State Standards and initiatives to assess teachers by student standardized test scores. Dintersmith traveled to every state to visit schools and see what works and what doesn 9t 4 and his prescription for the future of American education has very little to do with what Gates and others with that same data-driven mind-set have advocated. _ Not Bill Gates: Meet Ted Dintersmith, an education philanthropist with a different agenda (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2015/09/11/not-bill-gates-meet-ted-dintersmith-an-education- philanthropist-with-a-different-agenda/?utm_term=.1dd3463a3e5e)_ He thinks the U.S. education system needs to be reimagined into cross- disciplinary programs that allow kids the freedom to develop core competencies through project-based learning. He discussed his vision in a book he co-authored, cMost Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Age(https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00P42WP7K&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_wOSQAbTWA46DZ&tag=thewaspos09-20), and he funded and produced a compelling documentary called cMost Likely to Succeed(http://www.mltsfilm.org/), which goes into\\xa0High Tech High school in San Diego, where the project-based educational future he wants is already there. He has a new book being published in April, cWhat School Could Be: Insights and Inspiration From Teachers Across America(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069118061X?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=069118061X), about what he learned during his travels and school visits. In this post, he writes about what he saw and offers advice to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who recently said on c60 Minutes that she had never cintentionally visited an underperforming school. **By Ted Dintersmith** In her recent c60 Minutes interview, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos indicated that perhaps she should visit more schools. Yes.\\xa0 She needs to get out of her bubble and visit schools across America.\\xa0 I did, and there 9s much to be learned. _ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stumbles during pointed 860 Minutes 9 interview (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2018/03/12/education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60 -minutes-interview/?utm_term=.04a9d1ac57f4)_ For context, I spent the entire 2015-2016 school year immersed in education across America.\\xa0 In a trip that rivaled de Toqueville 9s, I traveled to all 50 states, visited 200 schools of all types and talked to thousands of people about school. Questioning my sanity, friends asked, cWhy take such a grueling trip? d\\xa0 But as a career venture capitalist, I know that ever-advancing technology is gutting the economy of jobs and reshaping what 9s needed for career and citizenship.\\xa0 These disruptions have profound implications for the future of our children and our democracy.\\xa0 I wanted to see how schools might take on this challenge. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pjCMmhYl7sQJLao3Rab_jXwvvbs=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q5HFE6FPO43QDFHS73BRWQJRTM.jpg)  During my travels, I met with every element of our education ecosystem 4 governors, legislators, billionaires, school boards, college admissions, textbook and testing executives, bureaucrats, students, parents and teachers.\\xa0 I covered every geography, demographic and school type. I had no ax to grind, no bias to uphold. I just wanted to listen and learn. For an administration that relies on index cards with cI hear you reminders, here 9s what our secretary of education needs to hear. First, America 9s teachers are dedicated, passionate and committed 4 across all types of schools.\\xa0 They care.\\xa0 Many are distressed, even in tears. Like troops fighting an unwinnable war, our teachers know they 9re being held accountable to tests that don 9t reflect real learning, nor lead to important competencies. We are demoralizing our teaching force, driving our best to early retirement and dissuading young adults from the profession that will shape our nation 9s future. Second, I was blown away by the many inspiring examples of great innovation I encountered 4 in classrooms, schools, districts and states.\\xa0 In these classrooms, teachers help kids develop essential skill sets and mindsets. Instead of checking off endless content boxes (AP U.S. History, for example, covers five centuries, allowing a whopping 30 minutes for the U.S. Constitution), students master what they learn, apply it and teach others.\\xa0 Much of the learning is hands-on, tied to real-world projects.\\xa0 Students have voice in creating initiatives and in defining their path forward. Teachers are trusted, and students approach schoolwork with a sense of purpose. Third, I didn 9t find charter schools to be, on balance, more innovative than public schools. Some of the most remarkable innovations I observed were in the very public schools that choice advocates dismiss 4 in places such as Charlotte, Newark, Coachella and Waipahu.\\xa0 And while some charter schools are deeply innovative, many grind away on test scores, with innovation limited to cute test-prep jingles. Free of regulation, you might think private schools would lead the way in innovation, but most are focused on the college application process, a serious impediment to innovation. Fourth, we fail to appreciate the heavy price our students and our teachers pay when we insist, cWe have to be able to measure it. In the early grades, I admired places that made thoughtful, diagnostic use of standardized tests to ensure young kids develop core learning skills. But in U.S. education, the higher the grade, the higher the testing stakes, with myriad adverse consequences. These bulk tests 4 SAT 9s, ACT 9s, AP exams, and especially state-mandated tests 4 are packed with questions tied to content retention, low-level procedures and formulaic thinking. In contrast, the better-designed OECD PISA tests comprise thought- provoking questions.\\xa0 So while U.S. kids lead the world in test prep, our testing regimen values the exact skills automation excels at, rather than teaching kids to think. Fifth, I met thousands of children during my trip.\\xa0 Not one showed any enthusiasm for test prep.\\xa0 But I met many parents, especially the affluent, who relentlessly push test prep on their child, drawing on tutors, pricey devices and manipulative bribes.\\xa0 This difference helps explain why in- poverty kids lag affluent cohorts in test-score cachievement. d\\xa0 To a large extent, test-score performance reflects the motivation and resources of the parent, not the child. Sixth, I was encouraged to visit districts, and even states, that are transforming their schools 4 all of their schools.\\xa0 Their leaders bring a compelling message about the urgency of change and lay out aspirational possibilities.\\xa0 They prioritize essential competencies, not state-mandated tests and obsolete curriculum.\\xa0 They trust teachers to lead the way, both in managing classrooms and designing next-generation assessments. They energize their community, enlisting support in the aspirational goal of helping schools rise to 21st-century challenges. These leaders inspire confidence and exude competence. Seventh, DeVos might be surprised at my conclusions about cthe very powerful forces allied against change she alludes to. In U.S. education, nonexperts tell experts what to do.\\xa0 Priorities are set by legislators, billionaires, textbook and testing executives, college admissions officers and education bureaucrats.\\xa0 These forces, perhaps unintentionally, impede real change in our schools.\\xa0 They push kids to study what 9s easy to measure, not what 9s important to learn. No worries that a steady diet of memorizing content and drilling on low-level procedures produces young adults who are sitting ducks in the innovation economy.\\xa0 Put all the chips on college-ready, discounting the importance of hands-on learning and discouraging those with non-academic proficiencies.\\xa0 Channel kids down the same standardized path, impairing their ability to leave school able to create and develop their own path forward 4 arguably the most important competence young adults need in a world where careers come and go. Finally, business principles aren 9t the key to improving U.S. education.\\xa0 If choice and competition improve schools, I found no sign of it. Pitting schools against each other in a test-score cHunger Games drags everyone down. I saw no sign of union status affecting a teacher 9s dedication or effectiveness. There is, though, one business principle that applies to education.\\xa0 If you want insight, spend time with those in the trenches.\\xa0 Our teachers know how to engage our children, to inspire them to race ahead, to prepare them for adult life. With the futures of millions of children at stake, we need to listen to our innovative teachers and trust them to be the powerful forces for informed, aspirational change in our schools. **Read more:** _ A venture capitalist searches for the purpose of school.

Putin 9s own aggression on the world stage has become an unexpected\\xa0catalyst for an investment boom in Russian education. As U.S. and European leaders continue to work to isolate Russia\\xa0over alleged election meddling and the conflict in Ukraine, a growing number of tycoons are pulling their children out of western schools and putting money into private projects that will aid Putin 9s attempts to reverse a decline in national academic rankings. Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine a month after the Sochi Olympics, more than 30 billionaires and senior executives with investments abroad have founded or helped fund projects to nurture students at home. The outlays coincide\\xa0with a halving in the number of new Russian enrollments at boarding schools in Britain, long the educational destination of choice for the country 9s elite, to 608 last year, according to the U.K. Independent Schools Council.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs Herman Gref, head of state savings bank Sberbank, opened a school called Horoshkola with his wife Yana in Moscow in September, joining billionaire Suleyman Kerimov 9s Zarechenskaya\\xa0Shkola and transport tycoon Nikita Mishin 9s Novaya Shkola.

Even his youngest son won 9t be admitted unless he passes the blindly graded entrance exam like everyone else, he said.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs from Rublyovka, Moshkovich said in an interview, referring to one of Moscow 9s poshest districts. cEducation is the key driver in the modern world and I want Russia to be competitive. This is for soul and country.     The first nation in space has fallen behind relative newcomers in math and science, mainly from Asia. A top six finisher in the pre-college International Mathematical Olympiad every year until 2015, Russia tumbled to a worst-ever 11th last year, behind upstarts like Vietnam, Iran and Thailand. On a broader level, Russia is middling, ranking 32nd out of the 72 countries in the PISA exam of 15-year-olds, far behind Estonia, a fellow former Soviet republic.   The World Bank warned in November that low government\\xa0spending on education and health in Russia ``may jeopardize both economic growth and the well-being of the population. 9 9 Russia spends about\\xa03.6 percent of economic output on each category,\\xa0compared with 4.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, in the European Union, the Washington-based lender said. Retooling the educational system after communism 9s failure remains a work in progress. Critics like Moshkovich, who got his graduate degree from the Moscow Institute of Radio, Electronics and Automatics, say low morale and chronic underfunding 4even the best teachers can earn less than $250 a month 4are just parts of the problem. They say state primary and secondary schools still rely too much on memorization and standardized testing and don 9t do enough to encourage critical and creative thinking.  cThere 9s no other project like it in Russia Moshkovich, 50, who made his fortune in sugar and pork, retired from the senate in 2014 to focus\\xa0on education. He 9s hoping the methods he 9s developing at Letovo will stimulate reforms nationwide. His school will offer students both a Russian diploma and a certificate from\\xa0International Baccalaureate, a Swiss non-profit with a curriculum it says cprepares students to succeed in a world where facts and fiction merge in the news. Letovo is modeled on the best international institutions in the world, with an expert council staffed by recruits from schools that understand the importance of atmosphere in learning like Winchester College in the U.K., Montgomery Bell in the U.S. and Raffles in Singapore, Moshkovich said. His $80 million campus includes dormitories, tennis courts, a soccer field, a running track, a stream and an artificial lake rimmed by pine forest. The other $120 million is set aside in an endowment, most of which is already deposited in Sberbank and earning interest. Tuition will run about $20,000 a year, half of what a comparable British school charges, but parents who can 9t afford the full amount will be eligible for grants on a sliding scale.

Shchukin said Letovo may be a game-changer not only for his industry but for the Russian system as a whole. Everyone who 9s interested in education is watching very closely because its success may spur more investment, giving parents even more domestic schooling options, he said. Letovo is already taking applications for Sept. 1, when it will welcome 170 students in grades seven to nine. Once fully operational in 2020, Moshkovich said 1,100 students in grades seven\\xa0to 11 will be receiving instruction from 160 of the best educators money can buy, including 60 foreigners.  cI 9ve already fulfilled my ambitions in business, I won 9t be able to spend the money I 9ve earned, the billionaire said. cMy goal now is to provide Russian children with a world-class education.

The analysis says in the North East 35% of white working-class students have entered with only vocational exams. The think tank is calling for more recognition of how exams other than A-levels are used to get into university, particularly by poorer students. And it warns of \"institutional snobbery\" against vocational exams. The research from the Social Market Foundation highlights how vocational qualifications are used for university applications - with about a fifth of places being awarded entirely on the basis of vocational exams.     Vocational exams 'ignored' But this is not evenly spread - with the report highlighting that working- class students from the north of England are particularly likely to have gained places with vocational qualifications. Young people from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications, such as BTecs. Children from poorer families are twice as likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications than the children of professional families. There is also a regional difference, with fewer people in the South applying with vocational qualifications. The think tank says this social divide produces an unhelpful bias in the system - with A-levels dominating political debate about university entry. The report says the emphasis on A-levels means that universities do not always give enough support or recognition for applicants with vocational qualifications. Entry requirements can often be set in A-levels, with the risk of putting off applicants with vocational qualifications. \"For too long, politicians and the media alike have ignored and even belittled the vocational route, because politics and the media are dominated by people who took the traditional route of A-levels then university,\" said James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation. \"Most of the people who run the country didn't do BTecs, and they don't come from the sort of background where BTecs matter most. \"The result is institutional snobbery against vocational qualifications and the people who have them.\" Maddalaine Ansell, chief executive of the University Alliance group of universities, said there had to be support for vocational alternatives to A-levels as a route into higher education - so they did not \"end up being dead-ends\".

Also pupils' progress in digital skills has not kept pace with technology, said Estyn in its annual report. The chief inspector welcomed a shift towards a \"culture of self-improvement\" and more joint working between schools. Half of secondary and 70% of primary schools inspected were judged good or excellent in 2016-17. This is broadly in line with overall results since 2010 with the rest judged adequate or unsatisfactory.    Looking after pupils' wellbeing is one of the strongest features of the education system, while standards and teaching are relatively weaker, according to Estyn. Chief inspector Meilyr Rowlands said \"there is much to be proud of in the Welsh education system\" and there are \"many strengths\" in nurseries, maintained special schools and in further education colleges. \"Variability, however, remains a challenge in most other sectors,\" he said. The education secretary welcomed the report as showing sustained momentum in the education system. Estyn's 2016-17 annual report looks at key policy areas over the past seven years, back to 2010 when the current inspection cycle began.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Literacy and numeracy** Poor results in Pisa international tests(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-25196974) were a key reason for introducing a new emphasis on literacy and numeracy in 2013 as well as a national reading and numeracy test for seven to 14-year-olds.(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38172346) The report says that since then there have been improvements in how schools promote literacy but the standard of pupils' writing is weaker than other aspects. In many primary schools \"pupils struggle to write creatively and do not write at length frequently enough\" and \"too many pupils continue to make basic errors in spelling and punctuation\". Over the seven-year inspection cycle the inspectorate found that in primary schools \"enthusiasm for literature, their knowledge of different authors and stories, and their ability to express preferences about specific books, authors or genres have declined\". Overall the report found that the teaching of numeracy has improved. But the report says: \"In about a third of primary schools and three-fifths of secondary schools, there are shortcomings in the way that schools plan for and ensure that pupils use and develop their numeracy skills across the curriculum.\"   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Developing digital skills** There has been an emphasis on boosting digital and information technology skills in recent years and, along with literacy and numeracy, schools will be expected to emphasise it in all elements of the new curriculum which will be rolled out from 2022. But the report says that opportunities to develop information communication technology (ICT) skills across subjects are \"limited in many secondary schools and a third of primary schools\". In just under two-thirds of primary schools, there are \"important shortcomings in standards of ICT\". Though most pupils are confident using programmes such as word processing and creating presentations, their skills are often limited to \"a narrow range of applications\".   * Are Welsh schools teaching enough digital skills?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39455837)   * Learning on iPads 'more enjoyable'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37429889)   * Computers 'do not improve pupils' results'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34174796)    Image copyrightGetty Images  **The Foundation Phase** Since 2011, three to seven-year-olds have been taught through the Foundation Phase(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42271232), which is meant to be a less formal way of learning through activities. But the report says that overall its application has been \"inconsistent\" and though there is generally a strong commitment to the principles \"more recently there has been increasing formality\". It says only about a quarter of schools deliver the Foundation Phase well and about three-quarters of head teachers do not fully understand the principles behind it.     Click to see content: estyn1_jan18(//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/estyn1_jan18)     **Tackling the effects of disadvantage** Another major priority in education policy over the past seven years has been tackling the impact of poverty on pupils' performance at school and, though the chief inspector has found that there is now a stronger focus in schools on this aim, the gap has not narrowed at GCSE(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-41513404). The report also notes \"despite some improvements, the attendance of pupils that are eligible for free school meals continues to be a concern at all phases\". Over the last three years, about 40% of 14 to 16-year-olds eligible for free school meals have less than 90% attendance compared to 16% of other pupils.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Primary schools** Between 2010 and 2017 there were improvements in the performance of boys and pupils eligible for free school meals. But in a third of schools more able pupils \"do not achieve what they are capable of\". Standards of wellbeing have been good or better in seven in 10 schools and attendance has improved in most schools. But the quality of teaching has varied over the past seven years. In 2016-17, 20% of the primary schools inspected were judged as excellent, and six schools (3%) were put in special measures due to failings.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Secondary schools** Half of secondary schools inspected in 2016-17 were good or excellent, a significantly lower proportion than primary schools. The report says that one possible reason why primary school inspection outcomes are better on average than those for secondary schools is the effect that external examinations can have. The proportion of schools with unsatisfactory standards generally increased between 2010 and 2017. Schools have performed well in terms of pupils' wellbeing and one of the greatest improvements has been in attendance, up from 91.4% in 2011 to 94.1% in 2017. Improved teaching is needed in a majority of schools inspected this year and over the past seven years, the report says.     **Welsh language development** When it comes to the Welsh language, in the early school years nearly all Welsh-medium schools and most English-medium schools pupils \"make a good start\" when learning to speak and listen in Welsh. But there are weaknesses in the way many local authorities plan for Welsh language provision and recruiting Welsh medium staff is \"a challenge across many areas of Wales\", says the report.   !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05vvl86.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionOldcastle Primary in Bridgend already collaborates with other schools on numeracy  School-to school collaboration More cooperation between schools is seen as one of the biggest shifts in education over the past seven years and Estyn believes there is enough excellence across Welsh education to support improvement and help reduce variability. The \"spirit of cooperation\" was most obvious in the way that the new curriculum is being developed.    Political and professional reaction David Evans, Wales secretary of the teaching union, National Education Union Cymru (NEU), said: \"This report shows that despite increasingly difficult funding settlements and the ongoing concerns of workload, schools and teachers in Wales are continuing to provide an education service we can be proud of. \" He said it was \"especially good news\" to see Estyn praising schools for working constructively together. Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said the move towards a culture of self-improvement within Welsh education was not enough to raise standards. He said: \"Everyone knows that unless the government urgently address the underlying issues of diminishing education budgets and failures on recruiting and retaining teachers, this new culture is merely a case of building a house on sand.\" Welsh Conservatives education spokesman Darren Millar said the report highlighted many of the same concerns from previous annual reports. \"It's clear that we need to make much more rapid progress to ensure that our children get the high quality education they deserve,\" he said. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"Our national mission for education seeks to raise standards, reduce the attainment gap and deliver an education system that is a source of national pride and enjoys public confidence. \"The report notes our efforts to reduce the attainment gap, but we know there is no room for complacency. \"That's why we're doubling the Pupil Development Grant(http://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/schoolshome/deprivation/pdg- and-early-years-pdg/?lang=en) for our youngest learners, so that every child has the opportunity to reach their potential.\"   ",

They have now been sent back to Cameroon, where the government has described them as \"terrorists\". Among them was Ayuk Tabe, the president of the interim Southern Cameroons government. Southern Cameroonians are demanding his release, and want to know if the other separatists are still alive.  Al Jazeera's Leah Harding explains.  ",

More recently, however, we 9ve seen reductions in how often students are tested and in the importance of the results 4 and now there are schools finding success with assessment alternatives. This post details that success and how it can be expanded to other schools and districts. This was written by Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair & Open Testing(http://www.fairtest.org), a nonprofit group\\xa0known as FairTest that works to end the abuse of standardized tests. By Monty Neill The misuse and overuse of standardized testing has greatly damaged education. The harm has been most severe for low-income and minority-group children, often turning their schools into little more than mind-numbing test- preparation programs. The evidence clearly shows it has failed to improve educational outcomes.(http://www.fairtest.org/independent-test-results-show- nclb-fails) The good news is the nation is making slow progress toward leaving the high-stakes testing era behind. This progress is gradually removing major impediments to genuine assessment reform. But what would that look like? Are there good models? The New York Performance Standards Consortium(http://performanceassessment.org/) is an excellent example for high schools that is also relevant to elementary and middle schools. The consortium focuses on inquiry-driven, project-based learning measured by performance-based assessments 4 and its success with the most vulnerable students makes its outcomes particularly impressive. The consortium is made up of 38 traditional public high schools. Thirty-six are in New York City. These follow the same admissions process as other New York City high schools that do not require entrance exams. The student populations largely mirror the city 9s student body, with nearly identical shares of black and low-income youth and students with disabilities, and higher percentages of Latinos and English language learners (ELL). Students enter consortium high schools with slightly lower English Language Arts and math average scores than citywide averages. A new report, cRedefining Assessment: Data Report on the New York Performance Standards Consortium(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhDg- gsYCiLxqpUud0j_hmfNu6qcHwHH), shows that consortium schools significantly outperform other New York City public schools. It found that the consortium 9s dropout rate is significantly lower than that of regular New York City public schools. Four- and six-year graduation rates for all categories of students are higher than for the rest of the city. Graduation rates are roughly 50 percent greater for ELLs and students with disabilities. Eighteen months after high school graduation, the college enrollment rate is 83 percent. That 9s 24 points higher than the city 9s. These rates compare favorably with national data(https://nscresearchcenter.org/snapshotreport-persistenceretention22/) on persistence into the second year of college. The college enrollment rate for cminority males is more than double the national average. **Performance Assessments** Central to the consortium 9s success are its cproven practitioner- developed, student-focused performance assessments. These are created by teachers and rooted in inquiry-based curricula and teaching. Students learn to investigate topics in depth and to explore their own interests within each subject. To cdemonstrate college and career readiness and to qualify for graduation, all consortium schools require students to complete four Performance-Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs). These include an analytic literature essay, a social studies research paper, a student-designed science experiment, and high-level mathematics problems with real-world applications. They have both written and oral components. In the oral component, students respond to questions from a panel of teachers and outside experts, similar to a graduate school thesis defense. For example, in social studies, each student must write and defend a research- based analytic paper on questions that have grown out of a history, government, or economics class. The Data Report explains that cin some cases the tasks are crafted by the teacher and in other instances by the student. The report includes samples of the wide range of interests addressed by the students. Avram Barlowe, who teaches history at consortium member Urban Academy, says PBATs require students to learn perseverance, how to assess and apply evidence, and explain their thinking in written and oral forms. They cdemand that students learn, through practice, how to read, write, calculate, observe and research in a critical manner. A DVD series, cTeacher to Teacher(http://www.teacherscollegepress.com/teachertoteacher.html), shows how teachers and students build their courses to attain these ends. One student said: cBeing educated at a consortium school had a profound effect on my life. Every student is entitled to an educational community as enriching and inspiring as mine was. **School Improvement and Accountability** The consortium has permission from the New York Department of Education to administer only one of the five required state graduation tests, English Language Arts. The PBATs, generally completed in 11th and 12th grades, replace the Regents exams in other subjects and for school accountability. All the PBATs and oral defenses completed for the common graduation requirement are evaluated using consortium-wide scoring guides. (They are in the report.) Written and revised as needed by consortium teachers, they enable consistent evaluations across schools. Samples of student work are blindly re- scored to evaluate both reliability of scoring and the challenge level of teacher assignments. Carefully selected examples help scorers and students think about high-quality work. These scoring guides could be adopted by other schools as well as states. The college persistence data show that the extensive reading, writing and long-term planning required for the performance assessments prepare students well for higher education. Consortium head and FairTest board member Ann Cook argues this evidence is far more valuable than test scores. The consortium 9s success challenges other schools and states to overhaul assessment and put educators back in control of assessment. The results give the lie to the claim that low-income youth need a tightly controlled intellectual and social environment or top-down mandates to succeed. The focus on teacher- and student-led performance assessments enables true instructional cpersonalization(http://www.fairtest.org/personalized-learning-or- continuous-online-testing). The consortium is also collaborating with elementary and middle-school teachers to design new assessments. These enable close observation and documentation of student growth and support inquiry-focused education. The City 9s Education Department has approved the consortium 9s assessment as one of the options for schools to use when assessing preschool children. However, an overhaul in Grades 3-8 runs into federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) mandates. One path forward is for states to take advantage of ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot project. The pilot is based on New Hampshire 9s success in transitioning from standardized tests to teacher- crafted performance tasks. FairTest 9s report, cAssessment Matters(http://www.fairtest.org/assessment-matters-constructing-model-state- system), uses New Hampshire, the consortium, and other strong examples to show how states can build a new system that ends the educational domination of standardized tests. And the consortium shows how implementing performance assessment can have great success where it most matters 3 for the students.  ",

        "article": "  **Seoul, South Korea** **-** South Korea(https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-korea.html) has banned English language classes for first- and second-grade students in elementary schools to \"minimise negative effects of early English education practices\".  The ban, which came into effect on Thursday, is part of a policy that, the government says, is in line with a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 that said teaching English may hinder the students' proficiency in Korean.  \"According to many English education experts and neuroscientists, the right age for learning English as a second language is the third grade,\" Kwon Ji- young, director of early childhood education and care policy division at the Ministry of Education, told Al Jazeera.  \"Starting second-language education at preschool is too early. Before that, social skills and cognitive development should take place. A lot of parents think earlier the better when it comes to learning a second language.\"  In South Korea, kindergartens that conduct English classes are not officially registered as pre-schools but operate as private academies.  Although expensive, the growing demand for early English education has made these outlets very popular among parents who can afford them.  Korea's\\xa0annual household income(https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/korea/annual-household-income- per-capita)\\xa0per capita is $15,335.\\xa0Some of these outlets charge more than $1,500 a month.   !(/mritems/Images/2018/3/2/deff1c416a3d4de7bd3dd0c5a84b7542_18.jpg)  ---  Kim has warned of a widening gap between 'haves' and 'have-nots' after the ban Faras Ghani/Al Jazeera     The ban, which will also see around 7,000 teachers lose their jobs, will create a further divide with children from low-income families set to miss out in a highly competitive society, say experts.  \"If, after the second grade, you compare the ones who received private English lessons with the ones who didn't, the difference will be huge. In Korean society, the more money you have, the more educated you can be,\" said Kim Hee- won, a private English teacher.  Kim, who has been teaching in the capital Seoul since 2003, ruled out English learning having an adverse effect on a child's proficiency in Korean.  She did, however, warn of the increase in demand for English institutions and also of the competitiveness that exists among parents.   {articleGUID}   \"In Korea, some mothers compare what kind of stroller they have for their kids, which hospital their child was born in and how they want to follow the trends.  \"The level of competition is very fierce, and they will spend a lot of money to ensure their child gets taught English.\"  Hwang Hee-jung, a single mother to Ko Jae-joon, agrees. Her son was born in the US and was studying in a Korean school in Seoul until last year when she transferred him to an international school.  \"I think speaking English is very important because the university admission exam we have\\xa0is very tough and students need to get a high score in English to pass,\" said Hwang.  \"In a Korean school, my son was taught English just one hour a week. Now, majority of his lessons are in English, and the more he practises, the better he will get.\"       ---   How an exam brings South Korea to a halt      Together with the ban, the ministry has issued a warning and reminder to Korean parents, urging them to treat English as a second language.  \"It's important how parents perceive English as a second language. Korean children are exposed to stressful learning conditions due to academic pressure. It even starts before they are born,\" said Kwon.  \"The Ministry tries to conduct programmes and seminars for parents to improve their perception of English education.\"  A Ministry of Education official, who wished to remain anonymous, said there would be plans put in place for children from low-income families.  \"The Ministry has plans which include offering financial help to attend English programmes and assisting schools which lack resources to create those programmes,\" the official said.   {articleGUID}   Mobile phone apps and online translation software are being increasingly used for basic communication.  But critics say English fluency is needed more than ever, especially in a society where long hours and extra effort often does not result in success due to the level of competition.  Korean parents will seek private lessons for their children in the aftermath, said one parent, before adding that the assurances handed out by the government will not count for much.  \"We will encounter the unavoidable gap between the haves and the have-nots. It's simple: No money, no opportunity, no education. That's how it will affect the children here in Korea.\"   ** _With additional reporting by Wooyoung Lee_**  ",

        "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended her agency 9s commitment to minority students in a wide-ranging hearing in which congressional leaders pressed Ms. DeVos on her department 9s budget. , Ms. DeVos testified before the House Appropriations Committee, fielding questions on the Education Department 9s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October. The request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. ,  cWith this budget, we can continue to return power to those who walk side by side with students every day, Ms. DeVos said. cBecause that 9s who budgets are for, not special interest, not legislators, not the system. This budget is about students. , But Democratic lawmakers disagreed that the budget would benefit all students 4 especially minorities. , Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, called the budget a cslap in the face for minority students. Ms. Lee seized on a proposed $1 million cut to the department 9s Office for Civil Rights, and its proposed cuts to after-school programs. , The cuts, coupled with the Trump administration 9s decision to examine and possibly rescind guidance meant to protect minority students from racial discrimination in discipline(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics /school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html) and special education decisions, inflamed a debate about the department 9s approach to minority students. ,  cYour head is in the sand about racial bias and racial discrimination, Ms. Lee said, adding: cYou just don 9t care about civil rights of black and brown children. This is horrible. , Ms. DeVos said that she was cvery proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights, and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination. , She also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools. ,  cI believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education, Ms. DeVos said. , She also defended her agency 9s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school-shootings- obama-discipline-policies.html) of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month. ,  cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps, Ms. DeVos said. cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is. , Ms. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country. , Ms. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association. , Ms. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to cspend taxpayer dollars efficiently. , The directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos 9s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee. , One week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was obtained by The New York Times(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/education-secretary- devos-reorganization-plan-union.html). ,  cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department 9s plans for fiscal year 2019, the email said. cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this. , Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was cabsolutely not true that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present. ,  cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that 4 a deliberative document not in final form, she said. cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization. , While it is not abnormal for education secretaries to reorganize the department, and not many decisions require congressional approval, it is also customary for the department to share details with key committees. , In the email, the staff member leaked a reorganization plan that included a consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Labor Department. , Education Department officials said they had since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most protested part of the proposal. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump 9s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. , Though the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House 9s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico(https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/14/devos- defies-white-house-education-budget-414849). Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. , Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department 9s programs and resources. , Ms. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop. , Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about ca disconnect between Ms. DeVos 9s administration and his office. ,  cIt 9s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don 9t have staff that understand how the system works, Mr. Frelinghuysen said. cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills. , The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts. , For the most part, Ms. DeVos 9s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services. , Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department 9s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department 9s overhaul. , Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of cofficial time, which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. , The union said the agreement came cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table, which concluded with the department 9s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. , The department said that the union cspent more than a year dragging its feet, and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. , The department put its final offer in place.

        "article": " PARENTS in England are faced with a choice when their children are old enough to attend secondary school. They can pay to send their offspring to a private school, which usually involves sitting an entrance exam. Alternatively, in some parts of the country, the child can sit an eleven-plus exam and, provided they pass, attend a grammar school. Grammar schools are publicly funded and tend to excel in league tables of academic performance. The overwhelming majority (about 90%) of British pupils, however, attend non-selective state schools. Debate has raged for years over whether most selective schools do well because they provide a better education than state schools, or merely because they cream off the brightest and most privileged. According to research led by Robert Plomin and Emily Smith-Woolley, both of King 9s College London, the educational benefits of selective schools largely disappear once the innate ability and socio-economic background of pupils at selective schools are taken into account.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

That information includes DNA data and the results of intelligence tests and exams. At first the researchers calculated a genetic score taken for each child by adding up contributions from thousands of minor variations in their DNA that past studies (including data from 300,000 individuals) have linked to educational attainment. Pupils attending grammar and private schools had significantly higher genetic scores than those in comprehensives. But when those scores were adjusted to reflect each child 9s test results at 11, as well as the education and occupations of their parents, the differences vanished. That makes sense. Previous research has shown that many of the traits that selective schools are screening for are, in part, inherited from their parents. The tests being used by schools appear to be inadvertently picking up some of these genetic differences. The researchers then scored each child based on the results of science, maths and English GCSE exams, typically taken by all schoolchildren in England and Wales at the age of 16. On average, the results of children at private or grammar schools were a full GCSE grade higher than those at state schools. That suggests attending a selective school gives children a boost. Without correcting for any other factors the researchers calculated the boost to be worth about 7.1% of the difference in GCSE results. But was this due to better teaching at these schools or an outcome of the selection procedure? To see, the team adjusted the grades based on the results of each child 9s test scores, family circumstances and genes. Once they did this, the gap between the schools narrowed dramatically, with school type explaining just 0.5% of the difference in average GCSE grades. For any individual, genetics accounted for about 8% of the difference, modest in comparison with the many other factors involved, such as socio-economic backgrounds, test results at 11 and things still to be accounted for. The research comes with important caveats. First, the thousands of genetic variations so far linked to educational attainment are not well understood. Many of these variations may not be linked to intelligence at all. If, for instance, a weak bladder leads a child to perform poorly in timed exams or protuberant ears means bullying blighted their education, genetic variants for these traits will show up as disadvantageous. Stronger bladders and flatter ears will therefore confer advantages and better genetic scores. Second, had the study also been conducted in a nation, such as Denmark, where wealth is more evenly spread it is possible that genetics would appear to play a bigger role in educational outcomes, because socioeconomic disparities would have a lesser impact. The research does not appear to support cprogressive eugenics d, as advanced by Toby Young, a journalist and a co-author of the study. Mr Young has argued that poor people should be able to screen embryos free on the basis of intelligence, if the technology becomes available. Setting aside ethical questions, many of the genetic differences that might appear to contribute to social mobility (think flatter ears, etc) may not be associated with actual intelligence. Overall, such an idea might shift educational attainment by a few percentage points at best. That is tiny compared with the advantages enjoyed by the children of the educated and wealthy.

        "article": "  Libertarian economist Bryan Caplan didn 9t strive for subtlety when he titled his new book _The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_. As I wrote in a  Remarks column(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/the-case-against- college) in the print edition of _Bloomberg Businessweek_ , the George Mason University professor makes a strong case that most of what people learn in high school and college is unnecessary and quickly forgotten. He says that only about a fifth of the value of an education is the increase in human capital. The rest is csignaling 4the degree itself puts you in line ahead of non-graduates, even if you learned nothing useful, because it tells potential employers that you 9re reasonably smart, reasonably determined to complete what you started, and reasonably good at fitting in. Signaling is a zero-sum game: possibly useful for the individual who gets ahead, but wasteful for society. I recommend the book. Still,\\xa0I can 9t fully buy\\xa0Caplan 9s conclusion that the solution is to cut back drastically on taxpayer support for college, and even high school. Caplan\\xa0disagrees with my disagreement. On the\\xa0blog he shares with some other economists, EconLog, he called(http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2018/01/two_comments_on.html) my article cfun and fair but indicated that I had fallen victim to csocial desirability bias by arguing that society should bend over backward not to deprive lower-income strivers of the human capital that college does build. (He also made a fair point\\xa0about my throwaway line concerning Sanskrit and cement mixing, and I agree with him, so set that aside.) Here 9s Caplan: > Human beings like saying 4\\xa0and believing 4\\xa0whatever sounds good, even if what sounds good makes little sense.\\xa0My question for Coy: If deleting 80% of the perceived social rewards of education makes you no more willing to cut public support for public education, what would?\\xa0 What if we deleted 90% of education&apos;s perceived social rewards?\\xa095%\\xa099%?\\xa0I know it sounds nice to say, \"If it helps one person, it&apos;s worth it,\" but that&apos;s crazy.\\xa0No one spends their own money so casually 4\\xa0nor should they.\\xa0Furthermore, you can easily use some of the budgetary savings to help \"strivers\" in more cost-effective ways.\\xa0So why not?     So let me answer that question. I accept Caplan 9s economics-y point that life involves trade-offs. If public support for education helped just one person while costing $1 trillion, it wouldn 9t be worth it. Likewise, if Caplan could prove that wasteful signaling accounts for 99\\xa0percent of the value of\\xa0education. But that 9s not what he says. He says it accounts for 80 percent of the value of education. Some other economists put the ratio considerably lower 4less than half. And reforms could further increase the amount of human capital that the education system creates. In other words, education really does educate, even if it is overly expensive and not very effective. When you yank public funding from education, you are making it difficult or impossible for children who grew up poor or in the lower middle class to get the same access to learning that children of rich families take for granted. As for Caplan 9s idea of using some of the savings to help strivers in more cost-effective ways: Tracking low-income students toward vocational education because it 9s all they can afford feels Dickensian(http://dickens.port.ac.uk/poverty/). Libertarians such as\\xa0Caplan\\xa0stress individual liberty and minimal taxation. Most of us are a bit more communitarian, meaning that we 9re more likely to think of society as a family. A family tries to give every child the very best shot at success, even when it is (overly) expensive to do so. If that 9s what Caplan\\xa0wants to call csocial desirability bias, so be it.   ",

Carranza, 51, a second-generation Mexican-American, has run the Houston school system since August 2016. He previously had been San Francisco 9s superintendent for four years and led school systems in Tucson and Las Vegas before that.\\xa0 Carranza joined de Blasio to announce the appointment at a City Hall news conference Monday. Last week, Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho reneged on an agreement to take the job.        Describing Carranza as the embodiment of the American Dream, de Blasio recounted the educator 9s upbringing as the child of immigrants who valued education.\\xa0He praised Carranza 9s success in increasing test scores among black and Latino students.  cIn everything he 9s done, he 9s been devoted to children and he 9s been a change agent in his work, de Blasio said. cHe has a proven record as someone who can get results while moving an equity agenda.

As of last week, Houston schools were facing a budget deficit of $115 million.  cI know that across this incredible state, the city of can-doers, New York City, there are thousands and thousands of parents who have the same aspirations\" as his own parents, Carranza said. cI still make it a point every week to visit classrooms.

(Evan Vucci/AP) More than $1 billion would be spent on private school vouchers and other school choice plans under the budget proposal released Monday by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The proposal also calls for slashing the Education Department 9s budget and devoting more resources to career training, at the expense of four-year colleges and universities. The proposal would cut $3.6 billion\\xa0 4 about 5 percent\\xa0 4 from the Education Department by eliminating\\xa0several discretionary programs, including one that funds after-school activities for needy children and another that covers teacher training. It contains many of the same ideas that DeVos pitched in her budget proposal last year, large portions of which Congress rejected.  cSo many of America 9s poorest children 4 especially African American and Hispanic children 4 attend failing public schools that afford them little hope of fulfilling their great potential, Trump said in his budget summary(https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02 /budget-fy2019.pdf). cThat is why families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school option that is right for them. The budget empowers parents, especially of our disadvantaged youth, to choose the very best school for their children. In a separate item, Trump seeks to ax a $40 million scholarship fund for D.C. residents who attend colleges and universities, a subsidy intended to make up for District residents not being able to get in-state tuition. _ Trump wants to eliminate federal funding for D.C. tuition aid program (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/12/trump-wants- to-eliminate-federal-funding-for-d-c-tuition-aid- program/?utm_term=.4d0571c1b091)_ DeVos originally sought $2.5 billion to support school choice initiatives, including private school vouchers, but the Office of Management and Budget rejected her request, according to people familiar with the proposal.\\xa0She is once again seeking to cut several discretionary programs, including federal funding for the Special Olympics and a grant program for college students with cexceptional financial need.  cThe budget . . . reflects our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently by consolidating and eliminating duplicative and ineffective federal programs that are better handled at the state or local level, said DeVos, who wants to eliminate 29 discretionary programs. cI look forward to working with Congress to pass a budget that puts students first and returns power in education to where it belongs: with states, districts and families. Many\\xa0of DeVos 9s budget priorities for higher education mirror provisions in the House GOP higher education bill, giving the secretary a good chance of seeing her vision in that realm come to fruition. Still, the forthcoming Senate version of legislation could be far less partisan than what Republicans are rushing through the House. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has vowed to work with Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the panel, to craft a bill, although the two are heading in different policy directions. DeVos 9s budget proposal last year sought to\\xa0cut 13.5 percent of the agency 9s funding, and aimed\\xa0to cut college work-study programs in half and end public-service loan forgiveness. Congress scaled back the reductions significantly and refused to approve a number of steps DeVos sought, including the work-study and loan forgiveness efforts and a plan to redirect federal money to expanding private school vouchers. ****The budget also includes other initiatives:  4 Allowing low-income students who receive Pell Grants to use them to enroll in short-term programs, although funding overall would not increase much. As it stands, students cannot use grant money to pay for academic programs that are shorter than 15 weeks or have fewer than\\xa0600 hours of instruction time. Although the budget proposal lacks specifics, the department could model legislation introduced by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). The pair have a bill that would allow students to use Pell grants for programs with a minimum of 150 hours of instruction over a period of at least eight weeks.  4 Folding the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, a form of federal aid for the children of deceased service members, into the Pell program to safeguard it from automatic spending cuts under sequestration, a package of cuts that is part of the 2011 Budget Control Act. Democrats proposed the same move in legislation to overhaul the Pell grant program last year.  4 Taking an ax to\\xa0loan forgiveness for public servants and to subsidized loans\\xa0through which the federal government pays interest while an undergraduate borrower is in school.  4\\xa0Changing\\xa0the allocation formula for the work-study program to provide funding based, in part, on a college 9s enrollment of Pell grant recipients. This resembles a provision in the House GOP proposal to reauthorize the Higher Education Act that sets aside work-study money for schools with the highest graduation rates for Pell grant recipients.  4 Consolidating five income-driven student loan repayment plans into a single plan that benefits\\xa0undergraduate borrowers, who can have the balance of their loan forgiven after paying 10 percent of their income for 20 years. As with his proposed budget last year, Trump wants to make good on a campaign promise to shorten the payment period to 15 years for undergraduates, but raise monthly payments **\\xa0** to 12.5 percent of income for both undergraduates and graduate students. Graduate students, though, would have to pay for longer: 30 years. This time, the administration is proposing to automatically enroll people who are severely behind on their loan payments in an income-driven plan, which could help bring down the default rate.  4 Reorganizing the department, including consolidating the Office of Postsecondary Education and the Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education, a move that underscores the Trump administration 9s focus on transforming postsecondary education into career training.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Convened to examine the causes of civil unrest in black communities, the presidential commission issued a 1968 report with a stark conclusion: America was moving toward two societies, cone black, one white\\xa0 4\\xa0separate and unequal. Fifty years after the historic Kerner Commission identified cwhite racism as the key cause of cpervasive discrimination in employment, education and housing, there has been no progress in how African Americans fare in comparison to whites when it comes to\\xa0homeownership, unemployment and incarceration, according to a report(http://www.epi.org/publication/50-years-after-the-kerner-commission/) released Monday by the Economic Policy Institute. In some cases, African Americans are worse off today than they were before the civil rights movement culminated in laws barring housing and voter discrimination, as well as racial segregation.  * 7.5 percent of African Americans were unemployed in 2017, compared\\xa0with 6.7 percent in 1968\\xa0 4 still roughly twice the white unemployment rate.  * The rate of homeownership, one of the most important ways for working- and middle-class families to build wealth, has remained virtually unchanged for African Americans in the past 50 years. Black homeownership remains just over 40 percent, trailing 30 points behind the rate for whites, who have seen modest gains during that time.  * The share of incarcerated African Americans has nearly tripled between 1968 and 2016\\xa0 4 one of the largest and most depressing developments in the past 50 years, especially for black men, researchers said. African Americans are 6.4 times as likely than whites to be jailed or imprisoned, compared with 5.4 times\\xa0as\\xa0likely in 1968.  cWe have not seen progress because we still have not addressed the issue of racial inequality(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/18 /white-people-are-really-confident-things-are-getting-better-for-black- people/?utm_term=.6fbcb7a5edc9) in this country, said John Schmitt, an economist and vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, citing the\\xa0racial wealth gap(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and- hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind- whites/?utm_term=.d4a39197bea7) and continuing racial discrimination in the labor and housing markets. cOne of the key issues is the disadvantages so many African Americans face, right from the very beginning as children. The wealth gap between white and black Americans has\\xa0more than tripled(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/05/heres-why-the- wealth-gap-is-widening-between-white-families-and-everyone- else/?utm_term=.f52b3d84a726) in the past 50 years, according to Federal Reserve data. The typical black family had zero wealth in 1968. Today the median net worth of white families 4 $171,000 4 is 10 times that of black families. The wealth black families have accumulated is negligible when it comes to the amount of money needed to meet basic needs during retirement, pay for children 9s college education, put a down payment on a house, or cope with a job loss or medical crisis, Schmitt said. _ Bolster black banks 4 and in the process, uplift a community that has been systematically marginalized for generations (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/move-your-money-move- society/2017/03/31/68cb95c8-036d-11e7-b9fa- ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.ee09717635b2)_ The lack of economic progress is especially startling, given that black educational attainment has improved significantly in the past five decades, Schmitt said. African Americans are almost as likely as whites to have completed high school. In 1968, 54 percent of blacks graduated from high school, compared\\xa0with 75 percent of whites. Today, more than 90 percent of African Americans have a high school diploma, 3.3 percentage points shy of the high school completion rate for whites. The share of young African Americans with a college degree has more than doubled, to 23 percent, since 1968, although blacks are still half as likely as whites to have completed college. Yet the hourly wage of a typical black worker grew by just 0.6 percent a year since 1968. African Americans make 82.5 cents of every dollar earned by the typical white worker, the report said. And the typical black household earns 61.6 percent of the annual income of white households, with black college graduates continuing to make less than white college graduates. Despite the poverty rate dropping from more than a third of black households in 1968 to about a fifth of black households, African Americans are 2\\xbd times\\xa0as\\xa0likely to be in poverty than whites.  cWe would have expected to see much more of a narrowing of the gap, given the big increase in educational attainment among African Americans, Schmitt said. A book, cHealing Our Divided Society, to be released Tuesday at a D.C. forum, also examines how little progress has been made in the past 50 years. Housing and schools have become resegregated, clocking too many African Americans into slums and their children into inferior schools. White supremacists have become emboldened. And there is too much excessive use of force\\xa0 4 often deadly\\xa0 4 by police, especially against African Americans, notes the book, co-edited by Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator and sole surviving member of the Kerner Commission.  cWhereas the Kerner Commission called for 8massive and sustained 9 investment in economic, employment and education initiatives, over the last 50 years America has pursued 8massive and sustained 9 incarceration framed as 8law and order, 9 the book says. cMass incarceration has become a kind of housing policy for the poor. The 1968 Kerner Commission report ended on a note of deja vu, citing a witness who recalled similar analyses, recommendations and, ultimately, inaction following a government investigation nearly 50 years earlier after the 1919 Chicago riot.  cThe destruction and the bitterness of racial disorder, the harsh polemics of black revolt and white repression have been seen and heard before in this country, the report concluded.

The answer, she said: cHe has a family to support. , Ms. Johnson is a single mother of three. Her experience is one example of what 9s called the motherhood penalty(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/a-child-helps-your-career- if-youre-a-man.html?_r=0), a term for the economic and career setbacks women experience when they have children. (Men 9s earnings went up by more than 6 percent when they had children, if they lived with them, and women 9s decreased 4 percent for each child they had, a study found(http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood- penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay). And research(http://gender.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/motherhoodpenalty.pdf) has shown that employers rate fathers as the most desirable employees.) , Ms. Keller, 35, is raising a 9-year-old son alone. cI 9ve made about 40 percent less than a colleague that 9s maybe only a tiny level above me, someone I didn 9t report to, Ms. Keller said. cI 9ve been in a situation where a male colleague was making 100 percent more. I almost died inside. , Next to Ms. Keller was Ms. Robbins. cThe last campaign I was working on, I told my campaign manager, 8We 9re going to lose if we do this your way, 9 said Ms. Robbins, who declined to provide her age. cSixty-five percent of my salary was cut. My leadership as a black woman meant nothing to them. , Ms. Robbins described another job in sales where she asked for a raise, from $14 an hour, after bringing in a major client. According to Ms. Robbins, the company 9s owner refused. After quitting, Ms. Robbins said, a man was hired to replace her. His salary? More than twice as much. cThat was the most humiliating experience that I have ever had, she said. , Sitting across from Ms. Robbins was Ms. Webster, 36, who says she left the law firm she was working for in 2016 after she wrote a letter to the partners suggesting that they were acting out unconscious bias. cAt least for one case, and it may have been for multiple cases, my time was being billed out at a lower rate than two of the three white, male paralegals, Ms. Webster said. cThe very next business day, I got put on a performance improvement plan, she added. cThey were putting the paperwork in motion to either justify firing me or getting me to leave. , Retaliatory practices toward employees who complain about discrimination are far from abnormal. The E.E.O.C. reported(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/retaliation_considerations.cfm) that 48.8 percent of the complaints filed by workers in 2017 contained an allegation of retaliation. , Toward the end of the evening, entrees were forgotten and talk turned to the current moment and the future. cI believe we 9re at a tipping point, Ms. Bickford said. cThe computer has really helped us disseminate information, and I think men are on notice now. Ms. Bickford and her colleagues in the business world have formed the Paradigm for Parity(https://www.paradigm4parity.com/), which provides a five-step plan for gender equality that they have persuaded dozens of corporate leaders to implement. , Ms. Robbins was recently one of the speakers at the Women 9s March in Philadelphia and is working to help elect more female leaders. And Ms. Johnson plans to stick around in city administration and in the union as long as she can. cWe have to look out for the ones who follow behind us, Ms. Johnson said. cThere are more battles to be fought. Everyone deserves a chance.  ",

(AFP/Getty Images) President Trump spoke for(http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou_minutes.php) one hour, 20 minutes and 31 seconds (including applause) to deliver his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, and spoke directly about education policy very briefly 4 for one sentence, or two if you want to be charitable. And he didn 9t mention school choice, which is surprising, given that he has said it is his chief educational priority. This is what Trump said in regard to education policy: > As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. There was nothing about school choice, graduation rates, student loans, standardized test scores, curriculum standards. And as Post reporter Moriah Balingit noted here,(https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live- updates/trump-white-house/fact-checking-and-analysis-of-trumps-state-of-the- union-2018-address/will-schools-be-included-in-trumps-infrastructure- plan/?utm_term=.75f93fcc3aee) he didn 9t include schools when he talked about rebuilding America 9s infrastructure, saying: cWe will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across our land. The focus on vocational schools is in line with his administration 9s views of the purpose of education: to create skilled workers for America 9s work force, which is rather limited in scope, as Arthur W. Foshay wrote in cThe Curriculum Matrix: Transcendence and Mathematics(http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_update/eu201207_infographic.pdf), in the Journal of Curriculum and Supervision in 1991: > cThe one continuing purpose of education, since ancient times, has been to bring people to as full a realization as possible of what it is to be a human being. Other statements of educational purpose have also been widely accepted: to develop the intellect, to serve social needs, to contribute to the economy, to create an effective work force, to prepare students for a job or career, to promote a particular social or political system. These purposes offered are undesirably limited in scope, and in some instances they conflict with the broad purpose I have indicated; they imply a distorted human existence. The broader humanistic purpose includes all of them, and goes beyond them, for it seeks to encompass all the dimensions of human experience. Or what Martin Luther King Jr., said about the purpose of education: > cThe function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character 4 that is the goal of true education. Trump gave anyone commenting on the education portion of his speech very little to work with, as seen in Education Secretary Betsy DeVos 9s statement about the address: > cAmerica must do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st century economy. I join the president in calling on Congress to act in the best interest of students and expand access to more education pathways. It is worth noting that despite his call for more vocational education, his first education budget proposal sought to slash $168 million in grants(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/06/06/all-but- impossible-republican-senator-says-trumps-education-proposal-is- doa/?utm_term=.bb2b4480afab)\\xa0that fund career and technical education programs in high schools. Why? He wanted to use the money to expand school choice. The proposal wasn 9t popular with Democrats or Republicans, and most of the proposed grant cuts were not supported by Congress. These were the only mentions of cschool or ceducation in his 2018 State of the Union Speech, besides the vocational schools remark: > The first pillar of our immigration framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age 4 that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet **education** and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. And: > One of Staub 9s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through **high school** , lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax 1cut raise into his new home and his two daughters 9 **education**. Please join me in congratulating Corey. And: > Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters 4 Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens 4 were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa 9s 16th birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa 9s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors 4 and wound up in Kayla and Nisa 9s **high school**. And he briefly mentioned college savings accounts, with cbriefly being the operative word: > Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8\\xa0trillion in value. That is great news for Americans 9 401k, retirement, pension, and **college savings accounts**.  ",

        "article": " The Education Department confirmed Monday it is no longer investigating civil rights complaints from transgender students barred from school bathrooms that match their gender identity, a development those students say leaves them vulnerable to bullying and violence. The Obama administration in 2016 directed public schools to allow students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity, even if that conflicted with the gender on their birth certificates. The administration concluded that barring transgender students from public school bathrooms was a form of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX. But shortly after President Trump took office last year, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the guidance, a move that was widely decried by civil rights groups who\\xa0said it could endanger the welfare of transgender students. DeVos said states and individual school districts should be able to determine how to accommodate transgender students. They argued that Title IX did not obligate schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. _ Trump administration rolls back protections for transgender students (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls- back-protections-for-transgender- students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.0b9d4e6180a8)_ Transgender students say using the bathroom that feels right for them is essential for their safety and well-being and poses no threat to others. Some other students and their families see it as an affront to privacy and traditional values. It is a battle that has been waged at school board meetings, in state legislatures and in the courts. A transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, took his fight to use the boys 9 bathroom to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016. The high court declined to hear the case after DeVos reversed course on transgender students rights. _ Transgender teen 9s road to the Supreme Court detours, but his story is not over (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/transgender- teens-road-to-the-supreme-court-detours-but-his-story-is-not- over/2017/03/07/b8c1d010-02a0-11e7-b9fa- ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.7aaebafe5d25)_ In the aftermath of the move, it remained unclear how the department would handle civil rights complaints from transgender students who were barred access to public school bathrooms. In June, Candice Jackson, the acting head of the Office for Civil Rights, told staff that it should evaluate civil rights complaints from transgender students on a case-by-case basis but did not say outright that bathroom complaints should be dismissed. That same month, the department dismissed a long-running civil rights complaint from a transgender girl in Ohio who had been barred from the girls 9 bathroom at school. _ Trump administration 9s approach to handling transgender students 9 civil rights complaints is described in memo (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/06/16/education- department-memo-lays-out-trump-administrations-approach-to-handling- transgender-students-civil-rights-complaints/?utm_term=.309ecd8f8811)_ Transgender students held out hope that the department would continue to back them when they raised issues about bathroom access, even though the guidance was no longer in place. Advocates maintain that Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, requires schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. Some federal appeals courts have backed this view. But the department interprets the law differently. It confirmed Monday that it will not investigate civil rights complaints from transgender students regarding bathroom access, though it will continue to scrutinize other forms of discrimination. The development was first reported by BuzzFeed(https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/edu-dept-trans-student- bathrooms?utm_term=.afY251de6.ctYNZRj6r).  cTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity, Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said in response to questions from The Washington Post. cWhere students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. In the case of bathrooms, however, longstanding regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Pressed on whether the department would investigate such complaints, Hill said: cWhere the Office for Civil Rights does not have jurisdiction based on current law the Office for Civil Rights does not investigate. That aligns with the view held by some conservative legal groups, which have sued on behalf of students made uncomfortable by sharing restrooms with their transgender classmates, saying it violates student privacy. But Catherine Lhamon, who headed the Education Department 9s Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama,\\xa0called the department 9s statement cappalling and deeply dangerous.  cThe federal courts have multiple times made clear that Title IX protects transgender students, Lhamon said. cThey just don 9t have the option to say, 8We just don 9t apply the law here. 9  DeVos has emphasized that her department would not tolerate bullying or harassment of transgender students, and Jackson 9s memo made clear that the department would still investigate other kinds of discrimination against transgender students.  cPlease note that the withdrawal of these guidance documents does not leave students without protections from discrimination, bullying or harassment, DeVos wrote last year after she rescinded the Obama-era protections from transgender students. cAll schools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment. Still, advocates worry that the administration 9s position will send a message to schools without clear policies that they should bar transgender students from bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. cThe vast number of schools in our country are schools led by teachers and principals and administrators who want to do the best for children but this will just be confusing, said Vanessa Ford, the mother of a transgender girl in the first grade who attends school in the Boston area. cThey hear this and think, 8Wait, am I no longer allowed to support trans kids at our school? 9   ",

They tested these on a set of 1,270 photographs of parliamentarians from around the world and found that all three classified lighter faces more accurately than darker ones. All also classified males more accurately than females. IBM 9s algorithm, for example, got light male faces wrong just 0.3% of the time. That compared with 34.7% of the time for dark female faces. The other two systems had similar gulfs in their performances. Probably, this bias arises from the sets of data the firms concerned used to train their software. Ms Buolamwini and Ms Gebru could not, however, test this because those data sets are closely guarded. IBM has responded quickly. It said it had retrained its system on a new data set for the past year, and that this had greatly improved its accuracy. When testing the new system on an updated version of the set of politicians Ms Buolamwini and Ms Gebru had used, the firm said it now achieved an error rate of 3.46% on dark-skinned female faces 4a tenth of that the two researchers had found using the existing system.

        "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress 9s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration 9s efforts to re- examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. , The report(https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-258), issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. , Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported 4 including by black students in affluent schools. , Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration 9s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. , The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. , On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year 4 and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. , Nina Leuzzi, a prekindergarten teacher at a Boston charter school, said she kept her word to her class of 20, predominantly minority 4-year-olds, in making her case to the secretary for why the guidance should stay. When the children asked her why she was traveling to Washington, she told them it was to keep them safe. ,  cRescinding this would send the message that there is no longer a concern about discrimination in our schools, Ms. Leuzzi said. , Nicole Stewart, a former vice principal in San Diego, told Ms. DeVos that pressures to reduce suspensions had made schools dangerous. She said administrators did not expel a student with a knife at her school because he had a disability. Weeks later, he slit a student 9s throat, she said. ,  cIt is no wonder that our kids don 9t think that rules and consequences apply to them, Ms. Stewart said. cWe are not modeling what consequences look like in the real world. , Ms. DeVos is facing new pressures after Republicans linked the guidance(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school- shootings-obama-discipline-policies.html) to the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and President Trump assigned her to lead a school safety commission that will consider whether to repeal the guidance. , Ms. DeVos has declined to say publicly whether she believes that racial bias plays a role in the disproportionate rates at which black students are punished in school. But according to attendees at Wednesday 9s meeting, the secretary opened her remarks by acknowledging that the conversations were taking place on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 9s assassination, and that racial disparities in discipline were a problem in the country. , Evan Stone, co-founder of Educators for Excellence, which represents nearly 30,000 educators across the country, said the acknowledgment gave him hope. cStill, we have a real uphill battle ahead, said Mr. Stone, who attended the meeting with Ms. Leuzzi and five other teachers who are part of the group. , Members of Congress urged Ms. DeVos not to make a decision on the guidance until the G.A.O. report was made public. The Education Department did not issue a response to the G.A.O. findings, as is customary, and did not respond to a request for comment on the report. , The Obama administration guidance was issued based on data that showed that, in 2012, black students were being suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. According to the G.A.O. analysis, in the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school. , The agency also found the disparities for black students started in preschool, and persisted regardless of the type of school they attended 4 disparities were particularly acute in charter schools 4 or the disciplinary action they received. , And black students were the only race in which both boys and girls were disproportionately disciplined across six disciplinary actions examined, which included corporal punishment, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and school-related arrests. , Moreover, the agency found that black students were suspended more often than their white peers in schools of all poverty levels. In the most affluent schools, 7.5 percent of black boys had been given out-of-school suspensions, while 1.8 percent of white boys had. , The finding marks the first time that national discipline rates have been analyzed by poverty level, and challenges a common claim that poverty, more than race, may be driving disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions. , Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles 9s Civil Rights Project, called the finding cgroundbreaking. He said it affirms other research(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class- white-and-black-men.html) that shows that even black boys raised in rich neighborhoods were likely to earn less than their white peers. ,  cThis further shows that poverty is not explaining the disparities, Mr. Losen said. cThere 9s a racial discrimination problem, and that can no longer be disputed. , The G.A.O. analysis was requested by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. , The agency was charged with identifying patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, the challenges that school districts faced with discipline reform, and how the Departments of Education and Justice have addressed the issue through enforcement measures. The investigation took place from November 2016 through March, and included data analysis and interviews with officials in the Education and Justice Departments, as well as district leaders in five states. , The report was praised by Democratic lawmakers as evidence that the 2014 guidance had value. The guidance informed schools that wide racial disparities could signal discriminatory practices that could result in a federal investigation and loss of federal funding. It also suggested a number of strategies for managing nonviolent behavior without resorting to kicking students out of school. ,  cThe G.A.O. 9s first-of-its-kind analysis confirms that racial bias contributes to pervasive discipline disparities, Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler said in a joint statement. cThe G.A.O. 9s findings underscore the need to strengthen the guidance, not rescind it as some have recommended. , But critics who want to see the Obama-era guidance rescinded said the report 9s scope was too narrow to draw broad conclusions. ,  cNone of these findings change the basic story line, said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research organization. cWhat we 9ve learned is discipline reform is being applied unevenly. If you are concerned there are some specific districts and schools that are responding particularly poorly to this, I don 9t think this study gets at that question. , Mr. Petrilli also said the report did not answer the question at the heart of the Obama-guidance criticism: whether racial bias accounted for all the disparities. , The G.A.O. examination illustrated how racial bias was unfolding in some districts. , For instance, at a school district in Kentucky where black students were 10 times as likely as white students to be disciplined, school officials acknowledged that 61 types of violations were undefined, which allowed staff to punish black students more harshly. , In interviews, district officials also reported that they maintained broad discretion in how they disciplined students, and that more serious offenses, like those concerning weapons, violence and drugs, still resulted in removing students from school. , And all of the school districts reported that while they embraced the opportunity to revise their approach to discipline, their biggest barrier was not student behavior. It was the lack of resources to tackle cases of trauma and mental health issues that increasingly plague the nation 9s children.  ",

Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed 2,387 schools would receive money from the \\xa3750m Pupil Equity Funding scheme in 2018-19. Schools in Glasgow will benefit from more than a sixth of the cash. They will receive a total of almost \\xa322m to help fund improvements at 191 schools. The amount of money each school will get is linked to the number of pupils it has receiving free school meals, with the money going directly to head teachers, allowing them to choose how to use the resources.    Mr Swinney announced the allocations to areas and schools ahead of the visit to St Francis RC Primary School in Dundee, where staff used part of the cash they received in 2017-18 to set up six week-long summer schools focused on boosting literacy, numeracy and wellbeing for pupils in the most deprived areas.  'Significant impact' He said: \"Every child should have the best possible start in life, no matter their background. Schools have a significant role to play in ensuring every child is given the right support to help them achieve their full potential. \"Our priority is to close the poverty-related attainment gap. This \\xa3120m of Pupil Equity Funding is aimed at doing just that. \"The funding is targeted towards schools who have the highest numbers of pupils receiving free school meals, so that the money is spent on the children who need it most.\"   He added: \"Last year's allocation is already making a big impact. I have visited a number of schools up and down the country where this funding has empowered teachers to put in place creative new initiatives that are tackling the attainment gap in their schools right now.\" Neil Lowden, head teacher of St Francis RC Primary School, said the cash from the scheme \"has had a significant impact on how I have managed my school in terms of the absolute focus on raising attainment in literacy and numeracy as well as improving outcomes in health and wellbeing for the children in St Francis\". He added: \"As a head teacher, the Pupil Equity Funding has fundamentally allowed our school community to make a real and significant difference to the lives of the children who come through our doors every day.\"  Temporary posts Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), said: \"The identification of funds to those pupils who need support is always helpful but unfortunately, it is replacing other support that has been lost during a continuous programme of education cuts. \"Schools always want to make a difference to those most disadvantaged with additional teachers to assist access to the curriculum and increase inclusion to activities that most other children take for granted. \"The major worry is the sustainability of the funding and the major investment in permanent highly-qualified professionals. \"The current arrangement has seen a large number of temporary posts being created that are not in the interest of the children who need regular and committed professionals to support them through their education journey.\" He added: \"PEP funding is a start but it cannot close, with the present limited funding, the gap to give the most deprived the same education experience as the most advantaged.\" The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said it had concerns about using free school meal claims as the basis for the allocation of funds. Executive director Eileen Prior said: \"We know there is some good work being done with the additional PEF funds but we are keen to see some hard evidence of impact on achievement and attainment.\"   ",

We have been putting educators in front of cameras and shooting video 4 just as the first TV shows did with radio stars, microphone in hand. This is not to say the millions of hours of online content are not valuable; the limits lie in the ability of the underlying technology to customize the material to the individual and to coach. That is about to change, though, through the use of virtual reality, artificial intelligence and sensors. Let me illustrate this with an imaginary school of the future in which Clifford is an artificial intelligence, a digital tutor, and Rachael is the human educational coach. Clifford has been with the children for years and understands their strengths and weaknesses. He customizes each class for them. To a child who likes reading books, he teaches mathematics and science in a traditional way, on their tablets. If they struggle with this because they are more visual learners, he asks them to put on their virtual-reality headsets for an excursion, say, to ancient Egypt. Watching the design and construction of the pyramids, children learn the geometry of different types of triangles and the mathematics behind these massive timeless monuments. They also gain an understanding of Egyptian history and culture by following the minds of the geniuses who planned and constructed them. Clifford also teaches art, music and biology through holographic simulations. By using advanced sensors to observe the children 9s pupillary size, their eye movements and subtle changes in the tone of their voice, Clifford registers their emotional state and level of understanding of the subject matter. There is no time pressure to complete a lesson, and there are no grades or exams. Yet Clifford can tell the parents how the child is doing whenever they want to know and can advise the human, Rachael, on what to teach. Rachael does not lecture or scrawl facts or equations on a blackboard. She is there to listen and help. She asks questions to help develop the children 9s values and thinking and teaches them how to work with one other. She has the responsibility of ensuring that students learn what they need to, and she guides them in ways Clifford cannot. She also helps with the physical side of projects, things made out of real materials rather than in mind and machine. With Clifford as teacher and Rachel as coach, children do not even realize that what they are undertaking is study. It feels like building cool stuff, playing video games and living through history. Clifford, being software and having come into being in the same way that the free applications on our smartphones have, comes without financial charge. Rachael 9s coaching is part of our public education package, funded in the same way today 9s teachers are. We already have wonderful teachers who are supportive and can teach teamwork and values. Believe it or not, we have the ability to build Clifford today. The artificial intelligence tools and sensors to observe human emotion are commonly available via smartphones and digital assistants, and the virtual- reality headsets will soon be powerful enough and affordable enough for holographic learning. Take Facebook 9s Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. When Facebook released Oculus Rift in March 2016, it cost $599 and required a $199 controller and a $1,000 gaming PC. The headset and controller now cost $399 together and do the work of the gaming PC.\\xa0Facebook says(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__newsroom.fb .com_news_2017_10_oculus-2Dannounces-2Dnew-2Dstandalone-2Dheadset-2Dvenues- 2Dat-2Doculus- 2Dconnect_&d=DwMFAg&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r =FozfRwBUYhObqbKa- g0kKh33gdKARdRC8VIU_2g52uI&m=EilB8AlectwQNNSAtIndA21-hBowlPJpBDtb4kx2uCw&s=RiYHpfxaQnHBt41Is3ImZZ7WYf3UEc8n4dbccMagoBY&e=)\\xa0a new version, Oculus Go, will ship later this year and cost $199.

Caplan is right about kids spending time on subjects seemingly irrelevant to the modern labor market, but he 9s wrong about it being a problem. What 9s wrong with most schooling today isn 9t its failure to meet the demands of the job market, but its failure to meet deep personal and societal needs. Of those needs, none is more important than improving the ability of the young to think for themselves, for the obvious reason that today 9s solutions won 9t solve tomorrow 9s problems. The accelerating rate of environmental, demographic and technological change is creating planet- wrecking stresses and generating problems that existing knowledge can 9t solve. Long-term survival is possible only if each generation is smarter than the one that preceded it. Education policies and procedures put in place beginning with the 2002 No Child Left Behind law haven 9t simply failed. They, along with the Common Core State Standards and high-stakes standardized tests, have tightened the screws on a curricular platform that 9s headed toward a cliff. Respected thinkers have long waved warning flags(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http- 3A__www.marionbrady.com_documents_QuotesFragmentation.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=4J0_QAeibnm3jIcl0xkCnJnzSloHIHdgphkccWm1tPs&m=SQ6_ZLf5EdrD4F1sUYmzVamEJiADsINMgNSvyTFUcIQ&s=W67gIVnnxofvUJzeclUHLyxZPG5qBji_qFkfmo0u2ZI&e=). The general education curriculum 4 traditional schooling 9s attempt to prepare the young for life 4 is at odds with the nature of knowledge. Nearly all of my 70 contributions to The Answer Sheet over nearly 10 years have been attempts to show that the subjects in the core curriculum are working parts of a holistic structure of knowledge, that adolescents of every ability level can construct useful versions of that whole, and in so doing better equip themselves for whatever the future may bring. What follows is a summary and links to free, illustrative instructional materials assembled from projects my brother, educator Howard Brady, and I undertook for three publishers who saw potential in ideas I had advanced in academic journals beginning with a 1966 article(http://www.marionbrady.com/articles/1966-NewSocStudies-KappanOct.pdf) in the Phi Delta Kappan. (1) We agree with many others that poverty is a major contributor to the achievement gap, but blame generation after generation of basically flat academic performance on the disconnect between experienced professional educators and state and federal education policymakers. (2) We believe poor academic performance is primarily a consequence of information overload. The traditional core curriculum dumps poorly organized, often useless information on learners in unreasonable volumes at unreasonable rates. (3) We believe standardized tests, and the simplistic assumptions about learning which they reflect, perpetuate merely the _appearance_ of learning. Learners ccram 4 store enough information into short-term memory to recite and pass quizzes and examinations. But when those threats no longer loom, most of what was ctaught and learned at great cost in money and time quickly disappears. In no other institution would such inefficiency be tolerated. (4) We believe an effective general education curriculum must have an agreed- upon aim, and that cmaximize learner ability to make sense of perceived experience is that aim. It puts schooling 9s emphasis where it belongs; respects the myriad implications attending personhood; is essential to the success of all legitimate aims of general education, and the inherent complexity of reality and of how the human brain perceives and processes information shuts down simplistic, attention-diverting creforms. (5) The arguments of defenders of direct instruction and teaching scripts notwithstanding, we believe useful levels of understanding of big ideas can 9t be delivered by text, teacher talk or technology. Firsthand experience isn 9t just the _best_ teacher of complex ideas, it 9s the _only_ teacher. Meaningful learning is assembled firsthand and gradually from sequenced experiences, a process labeled variously as active, discovery, inquiry or constructivist learning. (6) Big idea: Knowledge is created by organized human groups 4 civilizations, societies, ethnicities and so on, from which it follows that organized human groups are the phenomenon most needing to be studied and understood. (7) Big idea: From shared experience, groups 9 cognitive systems emerge 4 distinctive structures of knowledge or cworldviews. d\\xa0 Assumptions about the nature of reality, self, others, the supernatural, time, cthe good life, causation and a few other matters shape everything important that groups think and do 4\\xa0 their arts, sciences, institutions, religions, norms, values 4 everything. (8) Big idea: Nothing a group can know is more useful than an understanding of itself, but the cfish would be the last to discover water phenomenon makes acquiring that understanding difficult, and the information, when called to attention, seems too obvious and mundane to teach. (9) Big idea: Understanding other groups 9 worldviews is even more difficult. Most of the content of world histories has been generated by differences in worldviews, as has any randomly chosen day 9s news. Earth and its people suffer catastrophic consequences from ignorance of self and others. (10) Big idea: Human groups are _systems_ 4 integrated wholes 4 and must be studied as such. Academic disciplines and school subjects focus attention on myriad _parts_ of those wholes 4 their environments, populations, patterns of action, and so on 4 but failing to treat those as studies of system components blocks the basic knowledge-relating process by means of which knowledge expands. (11) Big idea: Studying these big ideas is best begun by using close-at-hand reality as the main learning resource. Each school, its contents and its immediate environs is a functioning, systemically integrated whole sufficiently coherent, comprehensive and complex to serve as a laboratory. That laboratory 9s concreteness and accessibility make it ideal, its comprehensiveness makes it an inexhaustible source of data, and its relevance and importance to the young assures engagement long enough for the familiar to become cstrange enough to see. (12) Big idea: Every human, consciously and unconsciously, seeks answers to the questions, cWhat 9s going on here, and what should I therefore do? Lifting that process into consciousness turns information into knowledge, and sometimes turns knowledge into wisdom. It should go without saying that (6) through (12) require learners to hypothesize, generalize, infer, synthesize, relate, correlate, extrapolate, value, imagine and so on 4 thought processes too complex and idiosyncratic for their quality to be evaluated by standardized tests. Useful evaluations of meaningful learner work will inevitably be subjective, a fact which, when understood, helps explain why thoughtful teachers believe grading that work is counterproductive. As the curricular screw-tightening of the Common Core State Standards and high-stakes standardized tests makes clear, education policymakers routinely underestimate both the complexity of teaching and the ability of the young to think. It we change nothing and continue to assume that the core curriculum does the job that needs doing, that teacher experience isn 9t worth its cost, that class size makes no difference, that incompetent institutional leadership has no serious consequences, that H.G. Wells was wrong in arguing that civilization is a race between education and catastrophe, then over the educational catastrophe cliff isn 9t just possible, it 9s inevitable.  To encourage experimentation and dialogue, instructional materials using core- subject content in ways consistent with (6) through (12) can be downloaded from the Internet and used free of cost and obligation. The lessons, and a small e-book arguing the merit of systems theory as the primary organizer of knowledge (and school subjects as secondary organizers), have been downloaded tens of thousands of times, suggesting an unmet need and the potential of bottom-up change and word of mouth to call attention to noncommercial, unadvertised teaching resources.

Marcus, President Trump 9s pick to head the Education Department 9s Office of Civil Rights, is coming under fire from critics who say they fear he will not protect the rights of racial and ethnic minority students. And his ardent support of Israel has sparked protests. Marcus,\\xa0president of a Jewish center for human rights who previously served in the George W. Bush administration, was approved\\xa0Thursday by the Senate\\xa0Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee\\xa0along with two other key Education Department officials. They include Mitchell Zais, a former South Carolina state schools superintendent who will serve as deputy to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The full Senate still must vote on the nominations. Marcus was tapped by Trump shortly after the president was criticized for blaming cboth sides for\\xa0violence that erupted in Charlottesville in August between\\xa0white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members and people who were protesting their presence. If confirmed, as expected, Marcus will be assistant secretary of civil rights, a position with which he is familiar; during the Bush administration, he was staff director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and he carried out the duties of the assistant secretary at the department. He would take over duties that have for months been carried out by Acting Assistant Secretary Candice Jackson. She also was\\xa0a controversial department official, in part for saying that 90 percent of campus sexual assault complaints are the result of too much drinking. She later apologized. _ Trump nominee for No. 2 spot at Education Department stumbles on key questions at confirmation hearing (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/15/trump-nominee-for-no-2-spot-at-education- department-stumbles-on-key-questions-at-confirmation- hearing/?utm_term=.88d08413d112)_ Marcus is president and general counsel of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law(http://brandeiscenter.com/)\\xa0in Washington, which says its mission is cto advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and to promote justice for all. d\\xa0 His official biography(http://brandeiscenter.com/about/president-biography/) says he founded the center in 2011 to ccombat the resurgence of anti-Semitism in American higher education. Marcus has been vocal in criticizing supporters of what is known as the Palestinian-led BDS\\xa0 4 or Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions 4 movement, which works to diminish international support for Israel economically, politically and academically. In a 2016 piece he wrote for Newsweek, (http://www.newsweek.com/anti-israel-boycott-legal-doesnt- look-460843)Marcus called BDS 9s academic boycott carguably anti- Semitic and criticized academic organizations that supported it. He has urged universities not to support calls to divest from Israel in support of\\xa0 BDS, and he has filed complaints with the Office for Civil Rights against several University of California campuses alleging anti-Semitic harassment of students. (The complaints were rejected.) In 2014, his center was one of a number of groups asking Congress to cend or mend(http://brandeiscenter.com/the-ldb-urges-congress-to-end-or-mend-hea- title-vi-diverse-perspectives-requirement/) federal funding for Middle East studies centers with what it called cbiased, politicized, anti- Israel and anti-American programming. At his confirmation hearing last month before the Senate panel, Palestinian supporters sat in the audience with their mouths taped shut, an effort to underscore their accusation that Marcus does not support free speech and that he makes no distinction between being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.A nonprofit group called Muslim Advocates sent a letter to Congress expressing concerns about Marcus 9s positions on a range of issues, including rights for LGBTQ students. It said in part: > While we take no position on the foreign policy merits of Mr. Marcus 9s views regarding the Middle East, his hostility to the civil right of free speech is well documented.\\xa0 He is a vocal antagonist of the right for college students who criticize Israel to express themselves and has even openly advocated for the abuse of OCR 9s civil rights complaint process to chill the speech of those with whom he disagrees. Marcus is supported by Republican senators on the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, including Lamar Alexander, who is chairman. Alexander, of Tennessee,\\xa0said at Marcus 9s confirmation hearing that Marcus chas a deep understanding of civil rights issues. And he said the committee had received letters from 13 individuals and organizations supporting Marcus 9s nomination, including one from Hillel International, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, which said: > Mr. Marcus has been a longtime champion for civil rights and for college students. We have worked personally with him on several campuses across the country in response to specific issues of bigotry and discrimination, and we have found him to be extremely skilled and knowledgeable in civil rights laws. Mr. Marcus has been a true leader in fighting discrimination.\\x85 But several civil rights organizations have\\xa0 come out against Marcus, including UnidosUS, the nation 9s largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization, and the National Urban League. The groups issued a joint statement saying\\xa0that Marcus had a ctroubling record with regard to enforcing the rights of immigrant students and English learners, and past attempts to undermine critical policies aimed at remedying racial discrimination, including affirmative action. Marc H. Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said in the statement: cMr. Marcus has a demonstrated history of hostility toward affirmative action and all race-based remedies to discrimination. He lacks a commitment to enforcing civil rights protections for students of color, and does not believe in disparate-impact or unintentional discrimination. All of which makes him unfit to lead ED 9s civil rights division. America 9s children both require and deserve an assistant secretary for civil rights who believes it is their birthright to receive a great, equitable public education. At his confirmation hearing in December, Marcus spoke about(https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marcus1.pdf) his experience in the Bush administration and said he worked hard to protect the educational rights of minorities and English-language learners. He said that all students, including transgender students, cdeserve equal access to education and should not be harassed and bullied. But he would not commit to investigating all complaints, saying they would be handled on a case-by-case basis. And he said he wasn 9t sure if the department had jurisdiction to protect the rights of undocumented students, as seen in this exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): > WARREN: Given the climate of fear and uncertainty that Donald Trump has created for Dreamers, if the school said happy to enroll all 5-year-olds in kindergarten, but kids who can 9t prove that they are citizens will be barred at the door. Would your office step in to protect the civil rights of those students from discrimination? > > MARCUS: Well, to my ear, senator, that sounds like a violation of law, but I don 9t know whether it would be a violation of one of the laws of which OCR has jurisdiction. There are certain rules here that would fall under the Equal Protection Clause. We would step in, if I were confirmed, if there 9s a violation of one of OCR 9s statutes. Here 9s another exchange between Warren and Marcus: > WARREN: Mr. Marcus, if confirmed, you would be responsible for protecting the civil rights of American students at a time when Nazis and white supremacists are marching across college campuses with tiki torches, and many young people are literally afraid to go to school because of the hateful climate that has been fostered by Donald Trump. If confirmed, will you commit to fully enforcing civil rights laws and protecting all students from discrimination and harassment? > > MARCUS: Yes. > > WARREN: Good. So, I just want to find out a little more detail about what that commitment means to you, and I thought we might go through a few fact situations. So, let 9s start with an easy one. Say there 9s a school district that has some mostly white schools and some mostly black schools, and let 9s say that the mostly black schools have less experienced teachers, teachers with fewer qualifications, those schools have fewer books, they have fewer computers in the library, fewer AP courses available. By any objective measure, those schools have clearly been shortchanged. If confirmed, would your office step in to protect the civil rights of that district 9s black students? > > MARCUS: If I were confirmed, I would ensure that any complaints alleging violation of Title VI would be 4 would be reviewed. > > WARREN: Mr. Marcus, I don 9t want to start a dance here. This is a set of facts that come to you in your position, if you are confirmed, and my question is are those facts adequate? Will you step in to protect the civil rights of the district 9s black students? > > MARCUS: Senator, I would certainly hope to be able to provide protection for the civil rights of those black students to the extent possible under law, but what . . . > > WARREN: But, that 9s the question I 9m asking how you see this. You 9re allowed to answer hypotheticals, here, so this one should be easy. A yes or a no, would you step in on those facts, or not? > > MARCUS: I appreciate that, senator, but unfortunately in my experience the cases that OCR deals with are much more complicated than hypotheticals. > > WARREN: So, you don 9t think that 9s enough evidence, what I 9ve just said? > > MARCUS: I think I would need to look at it very carefully. After questioning him, Warren said: cI don 9t think we need someone in this position whose view of civil rights enforcement is to do as little as possible to protect as few students as possible. I think that would be bad for students overall, and with Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, I think it would be even worse. The Senate committee also approved Zais as the department 9s No. 2. He is a former president of a\\xa0college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. And it approved Jim Blew, who was nominated to be assistant secretary for planning, evaluation and policy development. He was director of the Walton Family Foundation 9s K-12 reform efforts for nearly a decade,\\xa0and also national president of StudentsFirst, the reform organization started by former D.C. schools chancellor Michelle Rhee. There are 15 positions in the Education Department that must be confirmed, and so far the committee has confirmed four. One nominee was withdrawn by Trump, and six positions have no nominee\\xa0awaiting committee attention, according to a Washington Post tally. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics /trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/?utm_term=.a597d8bd5c4e)There are five positions with pending nominees, including Marcus, Zais and Blew. The committee announced Thursday it would hold a hearing next week to consider Trump 9s nomination of Frank Brogan, a former lieutenant governor of Florida and former chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, as assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education.

        "article": " HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) is a poorly named department. It usually has few resources other than overworked staff, clunky technology and piles of employee handbooks. Hassled recruiters have to sort through reams of applications that vastly outnumber the jobs available. For example, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), a consumer-goods company, receives 1.2m applications for 25,000 positions every year. AI-enabled systems can scan applications far more quickly than humans and work out whether candidates are a good fit. Oddly enough, they may also inject more humanity into hiring. According to Athena Karp of HiredScore, a startup that uses algorithms to screen candidates for J&J and others, only around 15-20% of applicants typically hold the right qualifications for a job, but they are rarely told why they were not hired, nor are they pointed to more suitable jobs. Technology is helping cgive respect back to candidates d, she says.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Nvidia, a chipmaker, also gets more r\\xe9sum\\xe9s than it can comfortably cope with, so it spent a year building its own system to predict which candidates are worth interviewing. It has recognised patterns that recruiters might not: for example, candidates who submit especially long r\\xe9sum\\xe9s turn out to do less well than others, so those extra words will count against them. Hilton, a hotel chain, has shortened the average time it takes to hire a candidate from 42 days to five with the help of HireVue, a startup. It analyses videos of candidates answering questions and uses AI to judge their verbal skills, intonation and gestures. This can be especially helpful when the candidate comes from a different culture or speaks another first language, says Ellyn Shook, chief leadership and HR officer of Accenture, a consultancy with 435,000 employees that also uses HireVue. Employers tend to hire candidates who are like themselves, which makes for undiversified workplaces. Orchestras, for example, used to be mostly male. Recruitment of female musicians went up only when they introduced cblind auditions behind a screen. Algorithms can act as virtual screens, making hiring fairer. Pymetrics, a startup whose clients include companies such as Unilever, a consumer-goods giant, and Nielsen, a research firm, offers a set of games for candidates to play, usually at an early stage of the recruitment process, that ignore factors such as gender, race and level of education. Instead they test candidates for some 80 traits such as memory and attitude to risk. Pymetrics then uses machine learning to measure applicants against top performers and predict their suitability for a role. This can help candidates without conventional qualifications. Another firm that is helping companies become more diverse is Textio, a startup that uses AI to improve job descriptions. For example, it has found that corporate jargon like cstakeholders and csynergies tend to drive away certain candidates, especially non-whites, and that women are less likely to apply for a job that is described as cmanaging than cdeveloping a team. Tweaking job descriptions can get 25% more qualified people through the door and boost recruitment among minorities, says Kieran Snyder, Textio 9s boss.

In the past, there was no way of redirecting them to other jobs as they became available. AI will make it possible to crepurpose candidates we have attracted before d, says Sjoerd Gehring, vice-president of talent acquisition for J&J. The health-care giant uses HiredScore, a startup, to grade candidates. When a vacancy opens up, the system automatically generates a shortlist of candidates that could be a good fit. This will bring big cost savings, says Mr Gehring. AI can also help with managing employees. HR professionals and recruiters at big firms cannot possibly know all their own talented workers across countries and departments, says Chris Louie of Nielsen. His company is using AI to improve internal mobility. Twine Labs, a startup that is working with Nielsen, suggests internal candidates for new roles, based on employee data and job requirements, taking in hundreds of variables. Around half the candidates it suggests are approved and promoted, says Joseph Quan, Twine Labs 9 boss. That is about the same success rate as for a human recruiter. Another use for AI is to help employers reduce staff turnover. On average, replacing a worker takes around 20% of annual salary, sometimes much more. Workday, a software firm, has started to predict how likely employees are to leave. It looks at around 60 factors 4such as pay, time between holidays taken and turnover in managers to whom the employee reports 4and flags those at risk of quitting so companies can try to retain them. Arena, a startup that works with hospitals and care-home companies, where turnover is high, considers retention even before it takes someone on. By using data from job applications and third parties to predict which applicants are likely to stay for more than a year, Arena has reduced its clients 9 median turnover by 38%, says Michael Rosenbaum, Arena 9s boss. In future AI may also be used to determine pay. Infosys is looking into using AI to decide when to give employees a rise, based on their performance and their pay relative to that of colleagues. The technology will make pay fairer by taking biases and personality traits out of consideration, says Sudhir Jha, head of product management and strategy at Infosys. But there is a risk that workers will try to game the system. All this points to a broader issue in AI: transparency. Companies will need to ensure that algorithms are being constantly monitored. In America, where it is illegal to discriminate against protected groups such as racial minorities, firms must be able to prove that they are hiring from these groups roughly in proportion to the population and are not introducing any bias, says Mr Rosenbaum. Startup bosses say they offer their clients transparency and regularly check their algorithms to make sure they are free of bias. But as AI becomes more prevalent, concerns will grow that algorithms could reinforce discrimination. Recruitment is just one example of the technological disruption that AI will bring to the workforce. The number of recruiters will come down, because AI will handle many of the mundane tasks they used to do, and face-to-face interviews will become rarer. At Unilever only shortlisted candidates are now interviewed, after several rounds of AI-enabled screening and recorded interviews through HireVue. For the remaining recruiters, though, AI will make work easier and more interesting. It may even help some of the workers it displaces. Accenture is rolling out a custom-built tool called Job Buddy which tells employees how vulnerable their job is to automation and predicts what training they might need so they can develop the right skills for the future. Ms Shook of Accenture says that around 80% of the people who have tried it are taking the advice it offers. But they may not have much choice.

        "article": " Ahmed's mistreatment may have been apparent to the entire world, but the law, at least according to this judge, didn't provide him a remedy. Ahmed deserved better from the legal system. If the case had proceeded through the full discovery process of sharing documents and taking depositions, we could have learned more about the details of Ahmed's treatment by school administrators and police officers as well as the broader climate facing students of color in the school district. !Hoboken mayor: Diversity is an American value (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Hoboken mayor: Diversity is an American value (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171108135551-election-wins- large-169.jpg)(/2017/11/21/opinions/hoboken-mayor-diversity-american-value- bhalla-opinion/index.html) Hoboken mayor: Diversity is an American value (/2017/11/21/opinions/hoboken- mayor-diversity-american-value-bhalla-opinion/index.html) Yet the court in Texas bypassed a deeper exploration of these issues by dismissing the case. This isn't a loss for Ahmed alone, but for all black and brown students who are experiencing the impact of punitive treatment within their school walls and a climate of bigotry outside of them. Discriminatory disciplinary practices targeting black students has become a national crisis as the Department of Education has found(https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/data.html) that black students are three more times more likely to be suspended than white students are. Black girls are acutely affected and are being suspended(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__ocrdata.ed .gov_downloads_crdc-2Dschool-2Ddiscipline- 2Dsnapshot.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=EP_9DVc9-CC6-Uhr9NMVzplbR4yw2-lmr0_XL7FfdBo&e=) at higher rates than any other girls of color. Students from Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian communities also face challenges because they are viewed as suspicious and dangerous in the post-9/11 environment. And, in the wake of Ahmed's encounter, other Muslim students reported(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mic .com_articles_125446_meet-2Dthe-2Dmuslim-2Dstudents-2Dwho-2Dhave-2Dbeen- 2Dharassed-2Dat-2Dschool-2Dfor-2Dless-2Dthan-2Da- 2Dclock-23.tsHOWCDJf&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=2KCFb_zuLj1Oz1ziFkw8Z8Fw7efHOdSk53f3zYYWa0g&e=) being targeted by anti-violent extremism initiatives at their schools, dragged out by school security personnel and suspended for minor infractions. These overall trends have continued since President Donald Trump took office. A 2017 poll(https://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AMP-2017_Full- Report.pdf) from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that one in four Muslim bullying incidents involves a teacher.

And a 2017 survey(https://nwlc.org/resources/stopping-school-pushout-for-girls-of- color/) from the National Women's Law Center found that 55% of Latina girls, 38% of Asian/Pacific Islander girls and 30% of black girls worry about a friend or family member being deported. !Donald Trump: the discriminator in chief(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Donald Trump: the discriminator in chief(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170825070624-01-donald- trump-0823-large-169.jpg)(/2017/08/26/opinions/trump-is-discriminator-in- chief-opinion-obeidallah/index.html) Donald Trump: the discriminator in chief(/2017/08/26/opinions/trump-is- discriminator-in-chief-opinion-obeidallah/index.html) In short, immigrant students and students of color are experiencing bias and bigotry in their classrooms, playgrounds and neighborhoods. School administrators and educators must be cognizant of the racial realities that young people encounter daily. And the legal system must take seriously the complaints of young people of color who face police brutality, stop and frisk, deportations and the school- to-prison pipeline. Otherwise, young people will confront challenges ranging from achievement and wage gaps to isolation to a sense that they just don't belong in America. We can and must do better to address the racial realities that young people face in America today, and there are a few concrete steps we can take. School officials must heed the recommendations of organizations such as the Advancement Project(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https- 3A__advancementproject.org_resources_taking-2Drestorative-2Dpractices- 2Dschool- 2Dwide_&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=j9XBWD8Kjxl6XZHxQst3HqCbIfSb6wHegqdvfQx83zc&e=), a multiracial civil rights group, and Desis Rising Up and Moving,(http://www.drumnyc.org/institutionalizedbullying/) which organizes low-wage South Asian workers and youth in New York City, by focusing on opportunities for collaborative problem-solving rather than simply relying on punitive disciplinary measures. Schools must set and evaluate equity benchmarks to close the achievement gap that often widens when children of color are suspended or expelled. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Students and teachers should receive ongoing anti-racist training and address the consequences of systemic racism and intergenerational trauma through inclusive curricula and honest dialogues. School counselors must provide culturally specific services and resources to children who feel targeted to strengthen their mental well-being and self-esteem. Parent-teacher associations and school boards must ensure that schools remain places of sanctuary and refuge for students. And students must be supported so they can organize, dissent and raise their voices. There was a simple reason why Americans responded with compassion and outrage when they first heard about Ahmed Mohamed. The legal system may ignore the culture of anti-black and anti-Muslim bias that pervades our school systems and country. But we knew better then, and we must do our part now to fight for justice for Ahmed and children like him in America.  ",

Calculations for the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) put Hull University(http://www.hull.ac.uk/Home.aspx) top for admitting a balanced intake of rich and poor students. Institutions like Cambridge, St Andrews, Bristol and Oxford were placed near the bottom of the table. Cambridge welcomed \"different interpretations of the data\". However, a spokesman for the university pointed out that the HEPI analysis relies on a single measure, adding \"widening participation in higher education is a complex issue\".      * I missed out on university but my son won't(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43084674)   * Wealthy students tighten university grip(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42339106)  Last year the charity Teach First compared official child poverty figures with university participation rates and found young people in some of the wealthiest areas of England were 18 times more likely(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40898523) to go to university than those in the poorest. Another analysis showed four fifths of students accepted at Oxford and Cambridge(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41664459) between 2010 and 2015 had parents in top professional and managerial jobs.  Neighbourhood chances Each year, admissions figures(http://www.hefce.ac.uk/analysis/yp/POLAR/), known as Participation of Local Areas (Polar), divide neighbourhoods into five groups, according to the proportion of young people going to university. In a perfect world each university would take a fifth of its students from each group, says HEPI. For this study, statisticians used the 2016 Polar data to rank each of the UK's 132 universities in terms of how near they came to this target.

Cambridge University said the Polar data takes no account of household income or access to education and \"effectively assumes that people living on the same street have the same likelihood of entering higher education as their neighbours\". The spokesman said Cambridge:   * Runs outreach programmes across the UK to raise aspirations among under-represented and disadvantaged groups   * Uses multiple measures to assess every applicant's educational and socio-economic background   * In 2017 had the highest level (63%) of state school applicants for 35 years and over 20% of students describe themselves as being from an ethnic minority.

(Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency) If Uncle Sam is committed to increasing the level of racial, ethnic and gender diversity in his government, particularly at the highest levels of the civil service, you sure can 9t tell it from the latest statistics. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) figures show diversity levels have improved little, stayed flat or, in some cases, regressed over the most recent period studied.  cThe percentage of minorities in the Senior Executive Service (SES) remained the same in FY 2016 as it was in FY 2015 at 21.2%, according to the recently released Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program Report to Congress(https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-and- inclusion/reports/feorp-2016.pdf) for fiscal year 2016, which was under the Obama administration. Women demonstrated the largest SES increase, with a 1 percentage-point bump to 35.3 percent, still far below their portion of the workforce. While there certainly have been advances since the first report, covering\\xa0fiscal year 2001, the gap between white men in top positions and other groups has always been substantial. White males made up 36.1 percent of the nation 9s civilian labor force in 2016. White people accounted for 78.8 percent of senior executives in 2015 and 2016 and were 66.4 percent of the national labor force. Bill Valdez, president of the Senior Executives Association, cited three reasons that diversity and inclusion (D&I) cefforts have stalled in the Federal government d:  * cAn absence of a link between mission accomplishment and D&I programs.  * cAn inability to articulate the return on investment (ROI) for D&I programs.  * cThe lack of a rigorous and analytical basis for D&I programs.  cHiring decisions that create a workforce that does not reflect the changing demographics of our nation are likely to have unintended consequences, Valdez said, csuch as investment decisions that do not address the needs of women and minorities, or the perpetuation of federal policies that have contributed to underrepresentation in the federal workforce. A deeper look into the generally stagnant people-of-color percentages reveals some ups and downs, albeit slight, among the groups. The largest variation was among African Americans, who are going backward in the SES, the highest civil- service rank. Their percentage dropped from 11.4 percent to 11 percent from 2015 to 2016. Asians increased from 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent, while Hispanics rose from 4.4 percent to 4.6 percent. That jump did little to bring SES Hispanics closer to their portion of the civilian labor force, which is 15 percent.\\xa0Hispanics\\xa0also are far behind in overall government employment, making up just 8.6 percent of federal employees. African Americans are 10.5 percent of the civilian labor force but 18.4 percent of federal employees. Civilian labor force percentages commonly are lower than population percentages.  cIt is obvious that Hispanic parity in the federal workforce will never be reached when compared with their numbers in the national civilian labor force, said Gilbert Sandate, chair of the Coalition for Fairness for Hispanics in Government. It estimates that this gap equals $8.5 billion in annual salaries lost to the Hispanic community. Government-wide data obscures wide variations among agencies. Black representation in executive departments, for example, ranges from about 38 percent in Education and Housing and Urban Development to a low of 5.6 percent in Interior. For Hispanics, the highest representation is 22 percent in Homeland Security; the lowest is 3.3 percent in Health and Human Services. HHS, however, has the highest percentage of women, at 64.9 percent. Transportation has the lowest, 26.2 percent. Using a Freedom of Information Act request, the Coalition for Change, an organization that focuses on bias in the federal workforce, found that from 2005 to 2015, 108 class-action complaints were filed regarding federal employment discrimination against black people.  cYear after year, thousands of black Americans, like the Black U.S. Marshals who have a pending class action against the U.S. Department of Justice, allege federal officials deprive them of career opportunities, such opportunities provide black Americans the avenue to attain Senior Executive Service Level positions, Tanya Ward Jordan, the coalition 9s founder and president, said\\xa0in an email. The OPM report does not cover President Trump 9s administration, but no one expects things to improve under this president. Quite the opposite.  cOur federal government functions best when it is equipped with qualified individuals\\xa0who meaningfully reflect and represent\\xa0the country they\\xa0serve, said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. cThere is\\xa0a stunning lack of diversity in the nominations Trump has put forward for judicial seats and executive branch\\xa0positions. It 9s clear he does not\\xa0value diversity and inclusion. The Leadership Conference pointed to a USA Today article(https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/trumps-87 -picks-federal-judges-92-white-just-one-black-and-one-hispanic- nominee/333088002/) that said 92 percent of Trump 9s judicial picks are white, adding, cPresident Trump 9s search for deeply conservative federal judges appears to have eliminated most African Americans and Hispanics from the running. Among Trump 9s first 87 judicial nominees, only one is African American and one is Hispanic. Five are Asian Americans.\\xa0Eighty are white. For Sandate, information like this means cthe prospects for brighter days ahead are dim when it comes to diversity in the federal workforce. At the end of its first year in power, the Trump administration has shown no signs of taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to emasculating agencies 9 budgets, missions and programs, and of marginalizing the rights of minorities, immigrants and people of color. **Read more:** It took 18 years, but\\xa0USDA\\xa0employee wins bias case again 4 showing how hard it is for feds to fight(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/06/it-took-18 -years-but-usda-employee-wins-bias-case-again-showing-how-hard-it-is-for-feds- to-fight-uncle-sam/) Kerner\\xa0Commission\\xa0member, staffers recall controversial report, at its 50th anniversary, blaming(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/02/kerner- commission-member-staffers-recall-controversial-report-at-its-50th- anniversary-blaming-racism-for-civil-disorders/) Rebel base names, statues disgrace U.S. military facilities and Congress(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/15/rebel- base-names-statues-disgrace-u-s-military-facilities-and-congress/) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  ",

Although there is something particular in the overt discrimination practiced toward Marina, the movie bridges language and cultural barriers, striking an emotional chord with the universal nature of its themes. It's worth noting, too, that the small, intimate approach to the story makes this a movie that will play perfectly well on TV, which is where many people will no doubt catch up with it.

It affects civic engagement, home ownership, job status, income, just to name a few things. And it affects health. In this piece, Karin Fischer writes about why education matters to your health 4 literally. Fischer is a\\xa0 senior reporter at the Chronicle of Higher Education(https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Education-Matters-to- Your/242123), where this first appeared, and which gave me permission to republish it. Karin Fischer covers the business of international education and the globalization of higher education, including competition for foreign students, activities by American colleges overseas, policies and programs that affect the international activities of American colleges, and the internationalization of the college experience. **_By Karin Fischer_** Across America, people are falling ill and dying young. These men and women have something in common. In fact, they stand out because of something they don 9t have: a college degree. A recent report,(https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/08/casetextsp17bpea.pdf) by Princeton University economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, made the stakes clear: Men and women who haven 9t been to college live shorter, less healthy lives, and are losing ground compared with college graduates. This is about more than money: the findings suggest that pain, stress, and social dysfunction may all play a role. Here 9s what you need to know about the research. Case and Deaton found that less-educated Americans were dying younger. Is that really so striking? In a word, yes. For decades, life expectancy for Americans has been improving, thanks to advancements in technology and medical care. Before 1999, middle-age mortality rates were declining by about 2 percent a year. But suddenly, starting in the late 1990s, rates of morbidity and mortality 4 in other words, of sickness and death 4 began to increase for white men and women between the ages of 45 and 54 who did not have a college degree. Since then those rates have been climbing by about half a percentage point a year among the white working class. cIn this historical context of almost continuous improvement, d\\xa0 Case and Deaton wrote, cthe rise in mortality in midlife is an extraordinary and unanticipated event. The researchers originally noticed rising death rates among the middle-aged and now see a similar deterioration for less-educated adults of all ages. The one exception is the elderly. At the same time, however, longevity has continued to improve for people who hold college degrees. The resulting disparity is striking: The mortality rate for 50- to 54-year-old men without a bachelor 9s degree is 867 per 100,000; for their more-educated peers, it 9s just 243. While there 9s long been a gap in health outcomes based on education, it looks now more like a yawning gulf. Is this just another way of saying that poor people are sicker? Yes, but that 9s not all that 9s going on. People with steady, well- paying jobs tend to be in better health, and that 9s especially true in the United States, where we have a system of employment-based health insurance. But the relationship between education and health is significant and independent of socioeconomic status. So, what 9s going on? Why does education matter? That 9s not an easy question to answer. Experts say there are all sorts of links between education and health,(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146517715671?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&) and whether there 9s a direct relationship between the two isn 9t entirely clear. People with degrees have more and better access to health care. They report greater job satisfaction and lower levels of stress. They read up on scientific breakthroughs and heed their doctor 9s advice when it comes to behaviors like eating healthfully, exercising, and quitting smoking. They are less likely to live near factories or freeways that belch pollutants into the air and are more apt to be surrounded by people like them, who reinforce healthful living. As one public-health researcher put it, the well-educated have a deeper bucket of resources to draw on. Case and Deaton, the Princeton economists, have their own idea, linking the increasing mortality rate to an uptick in deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and from suicide 4 what they call cdeaths of despair. Their theory goes like this: Over the past several decades, the economy has shifted, eliminating many of the jobs that once went to people without college degrees. The share of men in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who are not in the work force has more than tripled(ttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/12/upshot/where-men-arent- working-map.html) since the late 1960s. Those who do have jobs are unlikely to be pulling in the same sorts of wages as generations before them. Unable to provide a middle-class life, they may put off marriage; their social ties are often weaker. People without college degrees report being less happy than those with more years of schooling. As a result, they may turn to alcohol or drugs to cope. Deaths from opioids, in particular, have been soaring, and most of those who overdose are white. In short, the tough labor market may be at the root of the worsening mortality rates for those without higher education, but that 9s not the only thing to blame. Instability, dysfunction, stress: these cumulative disadvantages add up, exacting a deadly toll. You 9ve mentioned several times that death rates have climbed specifically for white Americans. Why focus on white people? Wouldn 9t members of minority groups be similarly affected by changes in the economy? Fair point 4 if anything, black and Hispanic Americans suffer from greater educational and economic inequities than their white counterparts do. Yet they have continued to show improvements in health and longevity. Partly it 9s that they 9ve long suffered from ill health and earlier deaths. Even with progress, there 9s still a long way to go. In fact, a new study(http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/13/1714616114.full.pdf) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill suggests that black and Hispanic young adults from poor backgrounds actually are in worse physical health if they complete college. Experts such as Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at the Johns Hopkins University, speculate that racial differences also might be a matter of expectations. It wasn 9t long ago that white working-class Americans(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/opinion/why-are-white-death- rates-rising.html) could count on leading a comfortable life with just a high- school degree. Middle-aged men and women, the very group falling ill and dying, are the first generation without that guarantee. They compare themselves with their parents and find their lives falling short. For black and Hispanic Americans, if you haven 9t got as much to hope for, you might just have less to lose. Come to think of it, you keep talking about Americans. What about people in other countries who don 9t have college degrees? Are they, too, getting sicker? They 9re not. Even right next door in Canada, longevity continues to improve. One reason might be that workers in other industrialized countries haven 9t experienced the same wage stagnation as have those here. But it 9s also the case that in Canada and throughout Europe, the social safety net is more pronounced. If where you live in the world makes a difference, are there healthier places within the United States? Case and Deaton play down geography in their work, saying that they spot the trend of increasing mortality across all regions of the country and in both rural and urban areas. But other researchers argue that location does matter. Rural America has been hit hard(https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Big- Bet-on-Higher/239585) by the changing economy, and the people there tend to be older, white, and less-educated than those in the cities and suburbs. What 9s more, a lot of public policy that affects the poor and less educated is set at the state and local levels(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865154/), points out Jennifer Karas Montez, an assistant professor of sociology at Syracuse University. That means there are places where it 9s tougher to be poor and without a degree. What 9s the solution: Just send more people to college? Few experts think that the answer is college for all. Instead they call for policy fixes that could help ease the disadvantage that comes from not having a degree. As a country, they argue, we should find more ways into the middle class that don 9t require a four-year degree, such as more-robust apprenticeship or training programs. They also call for strengthening the social safety net. States, for instance, could expand health coverage under the Affordable Care Act to help the working poor. They could raise cigarette taxes to make smoking cost-prohibitive for low-income residents. Education will still matter, but policy choices could mitigate its effect on health. It 9s true that more people today are earning college degrees, but perhaps that precisely why we ought to be worried about those who don 9t. While this group may be smaller, the disadvantages they face are compounding, and they are falling further behind. The divide between the haves and have-nots is widening.  ",

        "article": " In 2005, Gerry Adams went to South Africa. After landing in Johannesburg, he laid a wreath at Freedom Park before driving to the University of Witwatersrand to make a speech.  At that point, he'd been the leader of the Irish nationalist party, Sinn Fein, for 22 years. It was a party Nelson Mandela(https://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/nelson-mandela-nation- father-20126254044646548.html) described as \"an old friend and ally\", and this was one of several visits to South Africa by Gerry Adams that aimed to burnish his moral credentials as a peacemaker.  Waiting at the university was a BBC journalist who had scheduled an interview with the politician, and was struggling to find an interesting angle on a story about a man made famous in a conflict that had long since ceased to be \"top of the bulletin\"\\xa0material.  The interview started politely as Adams related his time in South Africa, and then the BBC journalist changed tack. Pointing to the African National Congress' (ANC)\\xa0largely peaceful overthrow of the apartheid regime, he asked Adams if he felt Mandela's party enjoyed a kind of moral legitimacy that Sinn Fein never would.   !(/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/2af8c6073e334a8fa49b5e130de87cf8_18.jpg)  ---  South African President Nelson Mandela meets with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in 1995 at the African National Congress headquarters in Johannesburg Juda Ngwenya/Reuters     He was, of course, referring to Sinn Fein being the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), an organisation responsible for killing more than 1,700 people.  It was an abrupt and unwelcome confrontation between two sides of Adams' persona, two epochs of his life: the defender of violence, and the man of peace. The politician responded by suggesting bias on the part of the BBC; the interview went cold, ended awkwardly, and was never broadcast.  Adams will soon step down as leader of Sinn Fein after 35 years at the helm. In that time, he has catapulted the party out of political obscurity.  Last year, Sinn Fein came within one seat of shredding the domination of pro- British political parties in Northern Ireland, a feat that could very well have resulted in a referendum on ending British rule there.  This success was built on the back of a negotiated settlement that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, a settlement in which Gerry Adams played a large part. As political resumes go, it's an impressive one.   A 'significant' figure  Former IRA man Tommy McKearney is not a cheerleader for Adams. Nonetheless, he describes him as \"one of the most significant major figures in Irish political life over the last 40 years, whether one likes or dislikes him\".  Adams' significance comes from him having persuaded the IRA to give up the use of armed force and to replace it with constitutional politics to achieve a united Ireland. This is a point even his unionist opponents acknowledge.  Ben Lowry, deputy editor of the Northern Irish unionist daily newspaper, the News Letter, says: \"He definitely steered the IRA, over a long period of time from the early 1980s until the late 1990s, away from violence.\"  Born into a poor family in west Belfast in 1948, Adams became involved in nationalist politics in the 1960s.   !(/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/79ca2363265a491aacacd03b1ea92679_18.jpg)  ---  Gerry Adams with Christy Burke, Sinn Fein's candidate in Dublin Central, in 1983 Independent News and Media/Getty Images     By his early adolescence, Northern Ireland had been run for 40 years by the Ulster Unionists, pro-British and almost entirely Protestant.  Injustices against Catholics, including discrimination in the allocation of housing and unequal voting rights, gave rise to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. Adams signed up to the organisation in 1967.  Two years later, a cocktail of political turmoil pushed this small region of the UK, containing just 1.5 million people, over a cliff.  Sectarian rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Belfast and Londonderry prompted a plea from the government for British troops on the ground. The troops were at first welcomed by Irish nationalists and Catholics as protectors, but quickly became the target of IRA gunmen, who saw them as illegitimate enforcers of British occupation.  The decades-long conflict that followed saw the Provisional IRA emerge as a deadly force that killed thousands of policemen, soldiers and civilians, as well as senior figures in the British government, almost claiming the life of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher(https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2013/04/20134814012127352.html).   Deadly hunger strikes  Gerry Adams spent the 1970s being variously interned and arrested for alleged IRA activity but has always denied being a member.  It was the events of 1981 that gave rise to his political career.  That was the year that 10 IRA prisoners starved themselves to death, using a hunger strike to demand political status that the British government refused to grant.  The outpouring of emotion that followed encouraged the Sinn Fein leadership to seek an electoral mandate that would back up their claims of widespread support for British withdrawal and Irish unification.  They would proceed, in the words of one activist, \"with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other\".\\xa0   !(/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/dd04213287b14b79b441b92189861187_18.jpg)  ---  Martin McGuiness and Gerry Adams pictured in 1985 Independent News And Media/Getty Images     Adams took over the leadership in 1983 and put that strategy into action.  McKearney was one of those who participated in a lesser known hunger strike in 1980.  Adams, he says, did not conceive of the strategy independently, but cultivated it and persuaded others.  \"The argument was being made through the 80s that there had to be an alternative,\" he says. \"The IRA, Sinn Fein and the republican movement, in general, has a political objective, and decisions were made pragmatically and rationally about how best to advance that political agenda.  \"Once it was deemed important to defend that position with arms and then the decision was taken to move away from arms, it wasn't useful any longer, and the movement was persuaded of that by Gerry and others.\"  What began as a dual strategy evolved over the course of the 1980s into a view among many in Sinn Fein that continued violence was pointless.  Some of this was likely motivated by the very successful efforts of British intelligence to undermine the IRA through a network of informers.  McKearney does not refer to this, but does describe the British state as a \"very strong and determined enemy\", and admits that \"some options were closed down and others opened up\".  Something of a window of opportunity for peace negotiations was opened in the 1990s. By the end of that decade, Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness had persuaded their party to enter into an agreement that would eventually see the IRA end its armed campaign and decommission its weapons in return for the release of prisoners and political representation in the government of Northern Ireland.  Gerry Adams, a man whose voice had been banned on British television four years earlier, now occupied an office in Stormont, formerly the seat of unionist power.  But observers point to a contradiction in that success. How, they ask, could Adams have so successfully controlled a notorious paramilitary group of which he has consistently denied ever being a member?  Since the peace agreement in 1998, Adams has been plagued by accusations from unionists and nationalists alike that he not only joined but helped to lead the IRA in the worst years of Northern Ireland's violence.  In 2014 he was questioned for four days by Northern Irish police in connection with the 1972 murder of a single mother of 10 children. He was released without charge.   'He can't tell the truth from lies'  There are those who excoriate Adams' record, and among them is former IRA member Shane Paul O'Doherty. Since spending a decade and a half in jail for his part in a letter-bombing campaign, O'Doherty has renounced violence entirely.  He calls Adams a \"strategist, full of charisma, a great cult leader, he has people who will follow him to hell\", but, he says, \"at this stage in his career he can't tell truth from lies\".  Editor Lowry says: \"Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community\".  Adams' characteristic opacity has fuelled speculation over his past. He is, says Lowry, \"mysterious, hard to read, inscrutable\". For unionists, that's disconcerting, especially since Adams is a man who gets results; for those who support him, it breeds respect.  > Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community.\\r > > Ben Lowry, News Letter\\xa0deputy editor > >   Even in the twilight years of his political career, Adams has continued to evolve and grow in stature.  He gave up his place in Northern Ireland's assembly to campaign for and win a seat in the Dail - the elected legislature of the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein is now the third largest political force in the Republic.  The party's future lies in consolidating its position on both sides of the Irish border; a future bought for it by the leadership of Gerry Adams.\\xa0  Most commentators believe Adams will remain an essential figure to his party behind the scenes, inhabiting a perhaps familiar position, in the shadows.

AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000. , Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school 9s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart. , Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools 4 nearly three times the rate of American children 4 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit. , Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education. , Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education 4 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria. , Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu 9s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school. ,  cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time, said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. cAlmost any problem space 4 no matter how different it is from the last 4 she seems to be able to tackle. , Lumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000. , Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.) , Classrooms in the school have been rebranded cstudios. There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working. , The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases. , Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums. ,  cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, 8This can 9t be true, 9 said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they 9re quite prescriptive. , Ms. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn 9t joined Ms. Wu 9s school. ,  cI felt like I was too restricted, she said. cI couldn 9t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them. , There is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school. In one studio, 8- and 9-year-olds worked on a project about socializing. The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up 9s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch. , Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas. ,  cI was kind of impressed with the number of clich\\xe9s and buzzwords that they packed into a short amount of marketing copy, said Audrey Watters, whose blog, Hack Education(http://hackeducation.com/), analyzes the intersection of education and tech. cIn the case of Luminaria, they have everything, they have all the buzzwords: social and emotional learning, mind- sets, grit, S.T.E.M., mindfulness, authentic learning, global consciousness. I mean, pick two of those. , Glenn Savage, an Australian education policy expert, said that it was difficult to see how the school 9s lofty goals could fit within Australia 9s cvery structured education system. ,  cIt 9s important that parents don 9t work on the false assumption that sending students to a school that claims to do things radically different means that the students won 9t be doing anything like students in other schools 4 because that 9s just not the case, he said. , One wall at the school displayed students 9 work with the Asylum Seeker(https://www.asrc.org.au/) Resource Center(https://www.asrc.org.au/), a nonprofit organization that assists refugees hoping to resettle in Australia. , The students had created a cpitch deck 4 tech jargon for a PowerPoint presentation 4 aimed at persuading the group to collaborate with them on a project (it worked). In a nearby ccreator space, students were working to build a profitable micro-farm. They have been assigned to grow and sell goods at the local farmers 9 market by the end of the school year. , One student, Ines Morgan, 8, said she particularly liked a project in which her class observed an ant colony. ,  cOur hypothesis was, 8What happens when an ant colony gets disrupted? 9 she explained. cThey lived in chaos for like a day or two, but then, a few days later, they stuck together and just all decided to rebuild again. , The school 9s website promises to remove the cstress and anxiety students encounter at other schools. , But if students are shielded from emotional adversity in their early years, critics say, they may struggle to cope when they reach high school 4 where desks, traditional teaching methods and puberty await. , Ines, the 8-year-old ant colony disrupter, said she had seen ca little bit of bullying but that it was dealt with as a collective. , When asked how the situation was resolved, another student, Noah Helu, 8, said, cWell, it 9s like what Ines learned about the ant colony: Sticking together helped us stop the bullying.

The school was one of the first in\\xa0Washington to move toward blended learning, in which students spend part of the day learning with teachers and the other\\xa0part learning online. (Photo by Linda Davidson / The Washington Post) How much do we really know about the effectiveness of online education? What happens to the personal data that students are required to provide to online learning providers? And, for that matter, what exactly is online education? These and other questions are addressed in a new report (https://networkforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Online- Learning-What-Every-Parent-Should-Know.pdf)that is a primer for parents and anyone else who wants to understand key issues surrounding what we call online learning. The report, cOnline Learning: What Every Parent Should Know, (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/22/university- of-wisconsin-students-protest-plan-to-drop-slew-of-liberal-arts-majors/)says that cshifting terminology of online learning is confusing, making it difficult for researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and the general public to know what K-12 online learning really is. The report\\xa0explains the different ways online education is provided to students, and looks at the issue of student data privacy, which gets short shrift from policymakers eager to push online education. Recent online data breaches 4 including Facebook 9s 4 show that kids 9 personal information isn 9t as private online as you may think. _ The astonishing amount of data being collected about your children (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/11/12/the- astonishing-amount-of-data-being-collected-about-your- children/?utm_term=.16e23061f847)_ The report was published by the nonprofit Network for Public Education, an advocacy group that fights to strengthen public schools. It was founded by education historian and advocate Diane Ravitch and educator Anthony Cody. The report notes that many students are required to use online programs, textbooks and apps as part of their schoolwork, and some states mandate that every student take at least one online course. Yet, it says: > The increased reliance on technology in schools is moving at a breakneck speed 4 one that far exceeds the accumulation of research on its effectiveness. Does online and blended learning enhance student learning? What do we know about virtual schools? How does profit influence policy decisions on the use of technology? > > Beyond questions of effectiveness, there are also student privacy concerns. Online learning, in all of its forms, captures a treasure trove of student data. Who owns the data and to what ends may it be used? Can private student information be sold for commercial purposes, with or without parental consent? What educational decisions are being made for students based on data that may or may not actually capture their achievement or abilities? In fact, some companies do use personal student data for marketing. A December 2017 letter from the\\xa0federal Education Department to Agora Cyber Charter Schools, an online chain owned by K12 Inc., ordered the company to stop violating federal privacy law by requiring parents who enroll their children to waive their rights to have their children 9s personal information protected from unrestricted disclosure and/or commercial use.

The local authority said other cuts being considered would affect services such as behaviour support and English as an additional language. The details are in a letter sent from the council to head teachers. In a statement, Highland Council said a \"wide range of proposals\" were being considered to help it make savings. The local authority's Independent-Lib Dem-Labour administration is having to tackle an estimated budget gap of \\xa325.8m in the coming financial year due what it what it calls the \"scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years\".     Cuts 'appalling' SNP councillor and former Dingwall Academy rector, Graham MacKenzie, has described the council's proposed cuts as \"appalling\" and said they would \"worsen\" the attainment gap in the Highlands. Teaching union the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said it would be concerned if the council pushed ahead with the proposals. In the letter, the council said reductions in additional support needs teachers and pupil support assistants had been proposed. However, it added that vacancies and the turnover in these roles were \"likely to protect all those presently in post\". Also proposed is a reduction in specialist additional support services, excluding NHS Highland-funded services. The letter said: \"This is likely to impact in educational psychology, behaviour support, English as an additional language, interrupted learning, autism, assistive technology, and pre-school support services.\" About 40 teaching posts could also be cut. This would affect medium-sized and larger secondary schools.  'Remain committed' Other possible savings outlined include having fewer crossing patrol personnel and \"significantly\" reducing funding to Inverness' Eden Court Theatre and to High Life Highland, which operates council-owned leisure centres, museums and libraries. The proposals will be considered by councillors on 15 February. In its statement, Highland Council said: \"We have managed to protect education in previous years, and there were no new saving measures for schools last year. \"But the scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years means it is no longer possible to sustain that level of protection. \"We remain committed to supporting education and maintaining teacher numbers as far as we can, and especially for primary schools and rural communities.\" It added \"Other councils have made savings on additional need services in previous years, and we are now having to consider that. \"Other than this, there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in 90% of Highland schools, as we will protect all primary schools and our smaller secondary schools.\" Alistair Bell, Highlands secretary of the EIS, said that while the details set out in the letter were only proposals at this stage they were still a cause for concern. He told BBC Radio Scotland: \"If this is what is going to happen it is a grave situation for what is already a stretched service. \"At a time when the Scottish government is asking teachers in schools to bridge the attainment gap, this can only hinder that process.\"   ",

Zeman, 73, is a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an early fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and campaigned by warning against Muslim migrants in a country with tiny religious minorities. His challenger, a 68 -year-old chemistry professor, vowed to creturn dignity to the post, a reference to Zeman 9s frequent clashes with media and political rivals. Opinion polls signaled a close race before the two-day runoff. Voting will resume at 8 a.m. and last until 2 p.m. Saturday, with results expected in the afternoon. The Czech Republic boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU, the lowest unemployment in the bloc and the highest living standards among its post-communist members. Still, Zeman has tapped anti-establishment sentiment that boosted populist politicians that challenged the EU 9s liberal, multi-cultural values elsewhere across the continent in elections last year. While the president has a largely ceremonial role, the post serves as an influential voice in public debate.      cCzech society is very divided, said Balazs Jarabik, a scholar at Carnegie Europe. cThe urban elites should show a bit more understanding toward rural voters. They really do have totally different possibilities. And the differences are only growing. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ3Z.QCPsoL4/v0/60x-1.jpg) Jiri Drahos, left, and Milos Zeman during a television debate on Jan. 23. Photographer: Michal Cizek/AFP via Getty Images While most executive powers lie with the government, the president names the prime minister, appoints central bankers and commands the military.

Zeman has already pledged to give Babis a second chance(/news/terminal/P2Z5U5SYF01S \"Czech President Zeman Sticks to Plan to Name Babis Premier Again\") to form a cabinet regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.

Critics say his pro-Russian and anti-migrant rhetoric, jokes about killing journalists, vegetarians and teetotalers and his support of extremist political forces including a far-right party that advocates leaving the EU, have undermined the authority of the presidency. Zeman calls himself a euro-federalist, but he also suggested that Czech Republic should hold a Brexit-style referendum to leave the EU. He said he 9d vote to stay in although people should have a choice.     During the campaign, the incumbent accused Drahos of being soft on refugees. His supporters ran a full-page add in Pravo newspaper on Thursday that said cStop the migrants and Drahos. This country is ours. While Drahos said the Czech Republic ccan handle some 2,600 refugees, he also opposes the EU 9s quotas for migrants.   ",

Less than two weeks later, about 1,300 black men employed by the Memphis Department of Public Works went on strike demanding better safety standards. But another\\xa0issue that motivated the men 9s strike was the demand\\xa0for ca decent wage. The sanitation workers were mostly black and did not receive compensation and benefits comparable to other city employees, many of whom were white. The protests eventually prompted the Rev.

The poor majority should vote to tax the rich and divide the proceeds among themselves. But that 9s not happening in the United States. In fact, inequality has been rising for decades. Scholars suggest various explanations(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/opinion/democracy- inequality-thomas-piketty.html). Here 9s one possibility that few have discussed: Poor voters may oppose a policy of higher taxes and income transfers because they wrongly think they 9ll be victims of it.  Defying logic The idea that in democracies the poor soak the rich goes back to Aristotle(http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.3.three.html). The economists Allan Meltzer and Scott Richard formalized(http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261013) the logic in a classic paper. If the majority gets to set a flat tax rate and share the revenue equally among all voters, then when incomes are especially unequal, the majority should set the rate higher. But in the United States, things haven 9t worked out that way. Rather than expropriating the wealthy, low-income voters in several swing states helped put a billionaire(https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/01/the- full-list-of-every-american-billionaire-2016/4bcce2ee37ac) in the White House who then slashed taxes on the rich. As Nicholas Carnes and Noam Lupu showed here(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/05/its-time- to-bust-the-myth-most-trump-voters-were-not-working-class/) last year, polls suggest most Trump voters had above-average income. But the crucial states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania all saw(http://www.weeklystandard.com /the-election-came-down-to-77744-votes-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-and-michigan- updated/article/2005323) big drops in the share of low-income voters supporting the Democratic candidate. Had large minorities of the poor not backed Trump in these states, Hillary Clinton would have won. Why don 9t poor Americans use their voting power to shrink the income gap? Some observers blame the Democratic Party(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871547651?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0871547651) for abandoning blue-collar workers to cater to educated elites. Others see the influence of racial(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FKRXYV4?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B01FKRXYV4) divisions or the power of tycoons(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/11/us/politics/2016 -presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html) and lobbyists to distort the agenda. These factors may well contribute. But there 9s another piece to the puzzle.  What you don 9t know can hurt you In a recent article, Vladimir Gimpelson and I show(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract) that in many countries 4 the United States included 4 most people simply don 9t know how high inequality is or where they fall in the distribution. Nor can they say reliably how it 9s been changing. _ Here 9s how little Americans have learned about Donald Trump (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/21/heres-how- little-americans-have-learned-about-donald-trump)_ On many different surveys, answering a range of questions, the average respondent guesses right about inequality only slightly more often than chance. Respondents do a little better in rich countries than in poor ones 4 but not by much. For a citizen to judge how redistribution will affect her, she needs to know how her income compares to those of others. Is she among the rich who pay more in taxes than they get back from public programs 4 or the poor, who come out ahead? Many don 9t know. In 2015, Ipsos MORI asked respondents in 28 countries to guess the average annual wage. That year in the United States, the correct answer was around $59,000, according to the OECD(http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=AV_AN_WAGE). The average guess was less than half that 4 about $26,000(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract). (Even if we suppose respondents had in mind post-tax not pretax income, the guesses were way too low.) Another survey in 2007 asked Americans about average household income(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168014545414). The median respondent guessed $40,000. According to the Census Bureau, average household income that year was $69,193(https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_07_1YR_S1901&prodType=table) 4 again, much higher than the typical answer. _ You need two things for a successful anti-violence movement. Post-Parkland activism about guns has both. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey- cage/wp/2018/02/23/why-neveragain-is-different-from-earlier-movements-against- gun-violence)_ Suppose that 4 as the Meltzer-Richard theory predicts 4 those with below average wages or favor income redistribution while those with higher wages or income oppose it. Clearly, a lot of Americans who fall below the true average think they are above it. That implies that many who would benefit from redistribution wrongly think that they would lose.  The Lake Wobegon effect This fits with another common bias. People tend to think they are closer to the middle of the income distribution than they actually are. As in Garrison Keillor 9s fictional town(https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/garrison_keillor_137097) where all children are above average, residents of many countries like to think they are close to the mean. The poor underestimate how much the rich earn, while the rich underestimate the poverty of the poor. Some misperceptions appear extreme. For instance, among the 5 percent of U.K. respondents who said they or their family owned two homes, a whopping 40 percent thought they were in the bottom half of the income distribution. Meanwhile, 19 percent of Americans who said they had coften or csometimes gone without enough food in the previous year placed themselves 4 implausibly 4 in the _highest_ -earning half. Across countries, actual levels of inequality bear little relation to the percentage who think government should reduce the income gap. But the level of inequality citizens perceive(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract) correlates strongly with demand for more redistribution. If people are misinformed, would education solve the problem? Not necessarily. Some research suggests people resist changing their minds even when confronted with contrary facts. For instance, Eric Lawrence and John Sides(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168014545414) found that respondents, even after learning average income was higher than they had thought, were no readier to support aid to the poor or job training programs. Ilyana Kuziemko, Michael Norton, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360), using an online survey, randomized whether respondents received information about inequality, but found this had little or no effect on their attitudes toward income tax rates and transfer programs. The source of information matters. People are readier to believe a message when it comes from a person 4 or political party 4 that usually argues the opposite(https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal- of-political-science/article/rumors-and-health-care-reform-experiments-in- political-misinformation/8B88568CD057242D2D97649300215CF2). If Republicans said inequality was too high and advocated aid to the poor, that would get attention. Of course, that 9s unlikely to happen. All parties portray reality in ways that serve their base. Wealth may be different. Unlike with income, Americans overestimate(https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2017-07/ipsos-perils- of-perception-charts-2015.pdf) the asset share of the top 1 percent. And attitudes toward the estate tax seem more responsive to facts. Telling respondents how few Americans are subject to it 4 less than 1 percent(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360) 4 increases the share that support the estate tax (by 11(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X15610190) percentage points) and that favor raising its rate (by 36(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360) percentage points). Misperceptions are certainly not the only reason poor Americans resist higher taxes to pay for programs that would benefit them. Culture, racial prejudice and political messaging also contribute. But the desire of millions to see themselves as more or less average may help explain why they don 9t use their voting power to shape public policies in their interest. _Daniel Treisman(https://www.danieltreisman.org/) is a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles. _  ",

The Brilliant Club(http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/) is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal. In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15. In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.  University gap This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.     Image caption Pupils get extra lessons with postgraduate students, showing them university is in reach  The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%. Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome. In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and \"classrooms fit for purpose\". In Philippi, she says: \"The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT information and communications technology. \"With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa.\" Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.  Image caption Putting young people in the frame for university  While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the \"academic and social skills\" needed to complete their degrees. But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons. The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking. In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and see, perhaps for the first time, what it's like to be a student and to show that it's an accessible target.  Unequal chances It's a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.  Image caption When pupils complete the course, they go on a visit to university to find about life as a student  University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education. Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year. But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered. Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university. \"Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement,\" says the impact report on AccessEd's pilot phase. But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal. * * * More from Global education(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * Liberia's big school experiment(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * Helping to keep girls in school in India(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * Terror survivor campaigns for open speech(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the Global education series(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

The move has been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney in a bid to tackle a recruitment crisis in the profession. The Scottish government said it was providing \\xa31.3m to create hundreds more opportunities for people to qualify as teachers. Edinburgh's Queen Margaret and Napier universities will train new recruits from 2019. Mr Swinney said the government was addressing difficulties recruiting classroom staff and he hoped this would \"build capacity within teacher education\".    It comes as the EIS teaching union warned schools are facing a recruitment \"crisis\" - with this one of the reasons why they are demanding a 10% wage rise for teachers.  'Raising standards' Edinburgh Napier University will initially offer a total of 30 places on a one-year Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) course - which allows those who already have a degree to train as teachers - with a focus on maths and sciences. It is planned to expand that into areas such as English and computing, with up to 150 training places after three years. Queen Margaret University will recruit up to 120 students to an undergraduate primary course but will also have 20 places on a PGDE course for those who wish to be home economics teachers.  Image caption The move could create hundreds of new teachers  Mr Swinney said: \"Teachers have a key role to play in helping us raise standards and close the attainment gap. That is why we are doing everything we can to attract talented and enthusiastic people to the profession. \"We recognise that, in common with many other countries, it is hard to recruit teachers in the numbers we need, particularly in certain specialist subjects. \"Adding two additional universities to the institutions that offer initial teacher education, supported by \\xa31.3 million investment from the Scottish Government, means we can not only recruit additional teachers to take up post within the next two years but build capacity within teacher education. \"The two new teacher training courses offer more choice and flexibility for anyone considering teaching as a career, especially in the specialist home economic and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects where we know there are shortages at the moment.\"  'By teachers, for teachers' Kenneth Muir, chief executive and registrar of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, hailed the move as a \"landmark development in the provision of initial teacher education\". He added: \"We must continue to adapt to ensure we do not miss out to other professions on new, high quality teaching talent. \"It is important that high standards are maintained and we will ensure the courses offered by QMU and Napier universities satisfy fully our accreditation criteria.\" Alistair Sambell, vice principal and deputy vice chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, said: \"Our new teacher education programme will be designed by teachers, for teachers. \"As a university we have an applied approach to learning, and student placements in schools will be underpinned by practice-based learning in class, supported by practising teachers.\" Prof Petra Wend, principal of Queen Margaret University, added: \"Teacher education at QMU will offer research-informed, practice-based programmes developed in collaboration with professionals from the sector and inspired by the needs of Scottish children and schools today.\"   ",

His first teaching job was at a school on the White Mountain Apache Reservation in the poorest county in Arizona, where young people face extraordinary challenges.

He was a finalist for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Teacher of the Year in 2016, and you can find him on Twitter here: @JustinParmenter(https://twitter.com/justinparmenter) This first appeared in Teachers & Writers Magazine(https://teachersandwritersmagazine.org/a-defense-of-creative- writing-in-the-age-of-standardized-testing-4460.htm), which gave me permission to publish it here. _ The real reasons so many young people can 9t write well today 4 by an English teacher (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.2c2ec99f20ba)_ **By Justin Parmenter** Ask any English teacher what he or she could use more of, and chances are you 9ll get the same answer.\\xa0 Classroom resources are great, more money would be nice, but what we _really_ need is more time. Just like in any other discipline, English teachers have way more curriculum than we can cover in a year.\\xa0 Time constraints force educators to prioritize by order of what feels most important, and all too often that importance is determined by what 9s going to be on the test. Our students pay the price as activities that cultivate essential real-world skills such as collaboration and creativity and provide them with a much more engaging and well-rounded education are eliminated from their classes. Educators are under enormous pressures stemming from a data-driven culture most recently rooted in No Child Left Behind and its successor, the Every Student Succeeds Act, in which the ultimate measure of professional and academic success is a standardized test score. As a result of this standardized testing culture, many of our English students spend way too much time reading random passages which are completely detached from their lives and answering multiple choice questions in an attempt to improve test results.\\xa0 In many classrooms, writing has become little more than an afterthought(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.d0ecfaa28732). Creative writing, in particular, is seen by some as a frivolous waste of time because its value is so difficult to justify with data. _ Teacher: What happened when I stopped viewing my students as data points (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/10/11/teacher-what- happened-when-i-stopped-viewing-my-students-as-data- points/?utm_term=.e96d3c779c3f)_ Two decades before the advent of No Child Left Behind, the research of influential literacy professor Gail Tompkins identified seven compelling reasons(https://www.ericdigests.org/1996-3/writing.htm) why children should spend time writing creatively in class: _\\xa0_  * to entertain  * to foster artistic expression  * to explore the functions and values of writing  * to stimulate imagination  * to clarify thinking  * to search for identity  * to learn to read and write The majority of Tompkins 9s outcomes of creative writing could never be measured on today 9s standardized tests.\\xa0 Indeed, over the same period that standardized reading tests have pushed writing in English classes to the sidelines, efforts to evaluate student writing on a broad, systematic scale have dwindled.\\xa0 Measuring student writing is expensive, and accurately assessing abstract thinking requires human resources most states aren 9t willing to pony up.\\xa0 It 9s much cheaper to score a bubble sheet. Measurement and assessment aside, the soft skills that we cultivate through regular creative writing with our students have tremendous real-world application as well as helping to promote the kind of atmosphere we want in our classrooms.\\xa0 After many years as an English teacher, I 9ve found that carving out regular time for creative writing in class provides benefits for me and my students that we simply don 9t get from other activities. One of the benefits of creative writing in the classroom is how engaging it is for our students.\\xa0 In general, much of our curriculum follows a one-size- fits-all design and allows little room for freedom of exploration. For young people who are at a time in life when many of their decisions are made for them, this lack of power can be very demotivating and can negatively impact their interest and effort.\\xa0 To do their best work, students need to feel that school is about them, and they need to feel connected to the content on a personal level.\\xa0\\xa0 When students are given opportunities to experiment with their voices and create through their own original work, they feel a sense of place and they are able to feel in charge.\\xa0 That 9s when they shine. A former student and talented writer told me the following about her relationship with creative writing in the classroom: _\\xa0_ > Creative writing is important to me because it gives me a way to express myself. There are not a lot of ways, as a young teenager, to be able to freely express ideas and emotions. Many are personal feelings you wouldn 9t really want to share with others. But in writing you can put all of those mixed emotions into words. Next thing you know, you 9ve created an entirely different universe, with characters close to your heart. Everything is under your complete control. That is not something that you can experience in reality, even reading a book. The feeling that you have created something, something that you can call your own, is what makes it incredible. When we empower our students to create something that is only theirs, to make big choices in their writing, it can transform attitudes toward learning and school in general.\\xa0 Having students who are motivated to work to their full potential is a dream scenario for any teacher.\\xa0 Regular creative writing can help us to move in that direction. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8K3M3Vh_C9VYIHxPNgEqX578qqg=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLU33FNQF44V5K3LVOOELH333A.jpg)  Another very real benefit of creative writing in the classroom is that it can help to develop a sense of community among our students.\\xa0 In our bitterly polarized society, any activity that fosters empathy and collaboration is well worth our time. Students can share writing with each other at the drafting phase, working together to hone their individual stories.\\xa0 This teamwork allows our students to support each other and work to understand each other 9s perspectives.\\xa0 In addition to peer editing, having students co-author creative pieces, whether as an informal cchain story type activity or a longer, more polished product, can go a long way in nurturing the skills required for effective partnership.\\xa0 Sharing responsibility in the creative process serves as a powerful motivator for our students, often leading to better quality writing. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tyjx1BVSC7AUFaJhbM_lDgsVNsY=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GGVJHNNS4QZ2ZM7BOHLJD652LY.jpg)  It 9s unlikely that our English teachers are going to get the additional time they so desperately need.\\xa0 What we 9re left with is the task of prioritizing class content in such a way that we 9re truly meeting all the needs of our students.

As a regular part of that instruction, creative writing can empower our students and give them ownership so critical to their motivation.\\xa0 It can provide them essential practice at partnering with their peers in a world where more effective collaboration is sorely needed. At its most powerful, creative writing can help turn our English courses into the life-changing experience that all educators want their classes to be.  ",

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) The latest flap surrounding Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stems from her inability to answer basic questions about schools during an interview she gave to Lesley Stahl on CBS 9s c60 Minutes on Sunday night. But it wasn 9t the first time she has revealed a lack of knowledge about fundamental education issues in front of a big audience 4 or said something that infuriated advocates of public schools. Here are nine things DeVos has said 4 or refused to say 4 in recent years that explain her views and philosophy about education in the United States: **1)** In 2015, before she became education secretary in the administration of President Trump, she said flatly that traditional public schools are ca dead end. That encapsulates the longtime view that DeVos has held 4 and spent decades advocating. She and her husband, Amway heir Richard DeVos, have spent time and money on school choice advocacy for decades. They were instrumental in pushing through Michigan 9s charter school law in 1993, and they support programs that use public money for private and religious school tuition 4 a position that critics say shows her desire to privatize U.S. public education. As education secretary, DeVos has said repeatedly that her definition of holding school districts caccountable d\\xa0is how many alternatives to traditional public schools they offer to families. Here 9s a quote from a speech she gave at the 2015 SXSW EDU convention in Austin: > We are the beneficiaries of start-ups, ventures, and innovation in every other area of life, but we don 9t have that in education because it 9s a closed system, a closed industry, a closed market. It 9s a monopoly, a dead end. And the best and brightest innovators and risk-takers steer way clear of it. As long as education remains a closed system, we will never see the education equivalents of Google, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, Wikipedia or Uber. We won 9t see any real innovation that benefits more than a handful of students. **2)** Then there was the infamous comment she made about schools and guns and bears. During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked\\xa0whether DeVos would agree that guns don 9t belong in schools. She said: > cI will refer back to Sen. Mike Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies. That statement is often held up as an example of her inability to articulate an answer to a question in a setting where many expected her to be more prepared, such as her confirmation hearing or her c60 Minutes interview. When the Senate voted in February 2017 to confirm her as education secretary, she became the first Cabinet nominee in history to need a vice president, in this case Mike Pence, to break a tie. That underscored her status as the most controversial in a pool of controversial Trump nominees. _ Six astonishing things Betsy DeVos said 4 and refused to say 4 at her confirmation hearing (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/01/18/six-astonishing-things-betsy-devos-said-and-refused-to- say-at-her-confirmation-hearing/?utm_term=.d96738a0a0b4)_ **3)** Just three weeks after becoming education secretary, DeVos displayed her unwavering focus on school choice 4 and a misunderstanding of the history of historically black colleges and universities by calling these institutions cpioneers of cschool choice. Actually, black students were barred from white institutions and had no choice but to go to schools specifically created for them. Here 9s what the statement said in part: > cThey started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn 9t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. She later walked back the cpioneers of cschool choice notion in a series of tweets. **4)\\xa0** She has refused to say whether the federal government should prevent private schools that accept public money from discriminating against some students. She said it was up to the states. At a May 2017 budget hearing before the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, Rep. Katherine M. Clark\\xa0(D-Mass.) said\\xa0one private school in Indiana that accepts publicly funded vouchers maintains it may deny admission to LGBT students or those coming from families with chomosexual or bisexual activity. Clark asked DeVos whether she would tell the state of Indiana it could not discriminate\\xa0that way if it accepted federal funding, and she asked DeVos what she would say if a voucher school rejected African American students but a state csaid it was okay. DeVos responded: cWell again, the Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX protections are broadly applicable across the board, but when it comes to parents making choices on behalf of their students. . . Clark interrupted and said, cThis isn 9t about parents making choices; this is about the use of federal dollars. Is there any situation? Would you say to Indiana, that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars? Or would you say the state has the flexibility? DeVos said: cI believe states should continue to have flexibility in putting together programs . . . _ Five startling things Betsy DeVos just told Congress (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/24/five- startling-things-betsy-devos-just-told-congress/?utm_term=.2923e7fe99f8)_ **5)** And she repeatedly disparages people who disagree with her views (though she isn 9t the first U.S. education secretary to do). At a May 2017 speech she gave in Indianapolis to the American Federation for Children 9s National Policy Summit,\\xa0an organization promoting school choice that\\xa0she founded and led, DeVos said: > cIn order to succeed, education must commit to excellence and innovation to better meet the needs of individual students. Defenders of our current system have regularly been resistant to any meaningful change. In resisting, these 8flat-Earthers 9 have chilled creativity and stopped American kids from competing at the highest levels. Our current framework is a closed system that relies on one-size-fits-all solutions. We need an open system that envelopes choices and embraces the future. **6)** Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord on June 1, and DeVos issued a statement applauding the move. When reporters asked her a few days later about her views on climate change, she responded: > cCertainly, the climate changes. Yes. Not only was that an example of her refusal to directly answer many questions, but it also suggested\\xa0the U.S. education secretary supports Trump 9s view that human-caused climate change is not real 4 despite\\xa0overwhelming scientific evidence that it is. **7)** During her interview with Stahl on c60 Minutes, DeVos acknowledged she had never cintentionally visited a low-performing traditional public school, and she made this unusual statement: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Here 9s part of the conversation about what happens to underperforming traditional public schools when children leave for alternatives and take funding with them: > STAHL: cWhy take away money from that school that 9s not working 4 to bring them up to a level where they are,\\xa0that school is working? > > DEVOS: cWell, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school, school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. > > STAHL: cOkay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that 9s not working? What about those kids? > > DEVOS: cWell, in places where there have been, where there is, a lot of choice that 9s been introduced, Florida, for example, the studies show that when there 9s a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually, the results get better, as well. > > STAHL: cNow, has that happened in Michigan? We 9re in Michigan. This is your home state. > > DEVOS: cYes, well, there 9s lots of great options and choices for students here. > > STAHL: cHave the public schools in Michigan gotten better? > > DEVOS: cI don 9t know. Overall, I, I can 9t say overall that they have all gotten better. > > STAHL: cThe whole state is not doing well. > > DEVOS: cWell, there are certainly lots of pockets where this, the students are doing well and . . . > > STAHL: cNo, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. > > DEVOS: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. > > STAHL: cThe public schools here are doing worse than they did. > > DEVOS: cMichigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. > > STAHL: cHave you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they 9re doing? > > DEVOS: cI have not, I have not, I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. > > STAHL: cMaybe you should. > > DEVOS: cMaybe I should. Yes. **8)** At her 2017 confirmation hearing before the Senate panel, DeVos seemed not to understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. DeVos said states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it. > HASSAN: cDo you stand by your statement a few minutes ago that IDEA should be up to the states whether to follow it? > > DEVOS: cFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play. > > HASSAN: cSo were you unaware, when I just asked you about the IDEA, that it was a federal law? > > DEVOS: cI may have confused it. She did confuse it in a most fundamental way. **9)** In 2017, DeVos rescinded Obama-era Title IX guidelines on how schools should handle allegations of sexual assault. Saying that too many men were falsely accused, she set new rules making it harder for accusers to prove their accusations. During a Sept. 7 speech on the subject(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/12 /education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60-minutes- interview/?utm_term=.5329f9e47b6d), she said: > cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. Actually, survivors had pleaded with her not to change the rules, saying the Obama regulations gave them a voice they did not previously have. Many were furious at her decision.  ",

(Screen shot by The Washington Post) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered her first speech of 2018 and flatly declared that school reform efforts under\\xa0Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had not worked 4 nor had any other reform effort by any education secretary. She also said\\xa0the establishment of the Education Department by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 was essentially a cgiant nod to union bosses. DeVos gave a keynote address at the American Enterprise Institute 9s conference titled cBush-Obama School Reform: Lessons Learned, and then answered questions from Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the conservative think tank. Here are some things she said 4 and didn 9t say 4 in her speech and in her conversation with Hess, followed by the text of the speech: **DeVOS :** > The federal-first approach did not start with No Child Left Behind. The push for higher national standards was present in the Clinton administration 9s cGoals 2000 initiative. Before that, we had President George H.W. Bush 9s cAmerica 2000, also calling for higher national standards. These followed the Reagan administration 9s cNation at Risk report, released in 1983. That report gave dire warnings about the country 9s track if education was not reformed. cIf an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, the report warned, cwe might well have viewed it as an act of war. That came after President Carter 9s giant nod to union bosses: the establishment of the Department of Education, with the ironic charge to cprohibit federal control of education. . . . > We saw two presidents George W. Bush and Obama from different political parties and philosophies take two different approaches. Federally mandated assessments. Federal money. Federal standards. All originated in Washington, and none solved the problem. Too many of America 9s students are still unprepared. When Hess asked her if there was a single Obama or Bush school reform initiative that was successful, she said she couldn 9t think of one. What she didn 9t say was that the school reform she supports 4 the wide expansion of school choice in the form of charter schools and programs that use public money for private schools 4 has not shown to be a solution to the problems she says plague U.S. schools.  4 **DEVOS:** > Most teachers feel they have little 4 if any 4 say in their own classrooms.\\xa0 That statistic should shock even the most ardent sycophant of cthe system. It 9s yet another reason why we should shift power over classrooms from Washington back to teachers who know their students well. Federal mandates distort what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. . . . > > Let 9s trust teachers, too. Let 9s encourage them to innovate, to create new options for students. Not just with public charter schools or magnet schools or private schools, but within the traditional csystem and with new approaches yet to be explored. She didn 9t mention that she has done nothing to empower teachers but instead has supported efforts to diminish the role of their unions, which provide due-process rights. In the speech, in fact, she takes a few potshots at the teachers unions, calling them cChicken Littles, even though early in the talk she promised not to cimpugn anyone 9s motives or to do any cfingerpointing. Her comment is clearly about traditional public schools, and she doesn 9t mention that teachers in many charter schools also don 9t feel as if they have any say in their own classrooms.  4 **DEVOS:** > I agree 4 and have always agreed 4 with President Trump on this: cCommon Core is a disaster. And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead. What she didn 9t say was that the Common Core State Standards, while dead at her department, are not dead in most states, even if the name of the standards has been changed in some of states.\\xa0A November 2017 report by Achieve(https://www.achieve.org/state-standards-remain-strong), an education organization that was involved with the creation of the standards, analyzed state standards and found that the essence of the Core standards in English language arts and math still stand in most states. At least in this speech she didn 9t say 4 as she and President Trump have in the past 4 that they would kill the Common Core. The federal government can 9t do that; it 9s up to state officials.  4 **DEVOS:** > Our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. They deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced and challenging life-long learning journey. Schools should be open to all students 4 no matter where they 9re growing up or how much their parents make. > > That means no more discrimination based upon Zip code or socio-economic status. All means all. > > It 9s about educational freedom! Freedom from Washington mandates. Freedom from centralized control. Freedom from a one-size-fits-all mentality. Freedom from cthe system. What she didn 9t say is what she said more plainly in 2015 and implied here: that the traditional public education system is ca dead end. _ To Trump 9s education pick, the U.S. public school system is a 8dead end 9 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2016/12/21/to-trumps-education-pick-the-u-s-public-school-system-is-a -dead-end/?utm_term=.294bacec0aba)_ _ How Betsy DeVos has mastered the art of the non-answer (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/06/03/how-betsy- devos-has-mastered-the-art-of-the-non-answer/?utm_term=.fb022a42934e)_ **Here 9s the text of the speech as prepared for delivery and provided by the U.S. Education Department. She refers to Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, and AEI research fellow Michael Q. McShane.  ** > Thank you, Rick, for that kind introduction. Who would 9ve thought that after we were last together on a panel in Grand Rapids a couple of years ago, I 9d be here in this capacity today? > > It 9s an honor to be with all of you at an organization I have long appreciated. AEI is now in its 80th year and in that near century, the Institute 9s scholars have influenced and shaped the way Americans think about so many issues in the public square. AEI has been 4 and will continue to be 4 a treasured constant in this town of transition. And it should be noted that 9s due in no small part to the leadership of Arthur Brooks, who brings a unique and compelling perspective. I 9m grateful to call him a friend. > > I 9d like to especially thank Rick and Michael for putting this volume together and for hosting today 9s important discussions. Both of you have contributed significantly to the policy debates in American education, and, importantly, you 9ve put your distinct perspectives and experience to work with the goal of improving education for all. You both left the classroom out of frustration, and there are still far too many teachers who share that experience today. > > My work over thirty years has revolved around time spent on the outside, looking in. Outside Washington. Outside the LBJ building. Outside cthe system. Some have questioned the presence of an outsider in the Department of Education, but, as it 9s been said before, maybe what students need is someone who doesn 9t yet know all the things you ccan 9t do. > > To a casual observer, a classroom today looks scarcely different than what one looked like when I entered the public policy debate thirty years ago. Worse, most classrooms today look remarkably similar to those of 1938 when AEI was founded. Take a look at this! She shows some slides. These two operating rooms look starkly different, as does this general store and this website. But these two classrooms look almost identical. > > The vast majority of learning environments have remained the same since the industrial revolution, because they were made in its image. Think of your own experience: sit down; don 9t talk; eyes front. Wait for the bell. Walk to the next class. Repeat. Students were trained for the assembly line then, and they still are today. > > Our societies and economies have moved beyond the industrial era. But the data tell us education hasn 9t. > > The most recent Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, report, with which you are all familiar, has the U.S. ranked 23rd in reading, 25th in science and 40th in math. And, you know this too: it 9s not for a lack of funding. The fact is the United States spends more per pupil than most other developed countries, many of which perform better than us in the same surveys. > > I know that hard truth touches a nerve for everyone in this room. It does so for educators who try to help their students realize their potential. For employers who seek prepared employees. And, most importantly, for parents who only want the best for their children. > > Of course there have been many attempts to change the status quo. We 9ve seen valiant efforts to improve education from Republicans and Democrats, liberals, conservatives and everyone in between. > > That 9s because everyone is aiming for the same result. > > Everyone wants students to be prepared and to lead successful lives. > > We can 9t say that sort of public harmony exists in other policy arenas. Not everyone agrees about the outcome or goal of tax policy or energy policy or immigration policy. > > Our unity of purpose here presents an opportunity. > > But while we 9ve changed some aspects of education, the results we all work for and desire haven 9t been achieved. > > The bottom line is simple: federal education reform efforts have not worked as hoped. > > That 9s not a point I make lightly or joyfully. Yes, there have been some minor improvements in a few areas. But we 9re far from where we need to be. We need to be honest with ourselves. The purpose of today 9s conversation is to look at the past with 20/20 hindsight, examine what we have done and where it has 4 or hasn 9t 4 led us. > > First, let me be clear that I 9m not here to impugn anyone 9s motives. Every one of us wants better for students. We want better for our own children. We want better for our communities and our country. We won 9t solve any problems through finger-pointing. > > I also don 9t intend to criticize the goals of previous administrations 9 education initiatives. In the end, every administration has tried to improve education for students and grow the number who are learning valuable skills. > > We should hope 3 no, we should commit 3 that we as a country will not rest until every single child has equal access to the quality education they deserve. Secretary Spellings was right to ask cwhose child do you want to leave behind? > > But the question remains: why, after all the good intentions, the worthwhile goals, the wealth of expertise mustered, and the billions and billions of dollars spent, are students still unprepared? > > With No Child Left Behind, the general consensus among federal policymakers was that greater accountability would lead to better schools. Highlighting America 9s education woes had become an American pastime, and, they thought, surely if schools were forced to answer for their failures, students would ultimately be better off. > > President Bush, the ccompassionate conservative, and Senator Kennedy, the cliberal lion, both worked together on the law. It said that schools had to meet ambitious goals\\u2026 or else. Lawmakers mandated that 100 percent of students attain proficiency by 2014. This approach would keep schools accountable and ultimately graduate more and better-educated students, they believed. > > Turns out, it didn 9t. Indeed, as has been detailed today, NCLB did little to spark higher scores. Universal proficiency, touted at the law 9s passage, was not achieved. As states and districts scrambled to avoid the law 9s sanctions and maintain their federal funding, some resorted to focusing specifically on math and reading at the expense of other subjects. Others simply inflated scores or lowered standards. > > The trend line remains troubling today. According to the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress data, two-thirds of American fourth graders still can 9t read at the level they should. And since 2013, our 8th grade reading scores have declined. > > Where the Bush administration emphasized NCLB 9s stick, the Obama administration focused on carrots. They recognized that states would not be able to legitimately meet the NCLB 9s strict standards. Secretary Duncan testified that 82 percent of the nation 9s schools would likely fail to meet the law 9s requirements 4 thus subjecting them to crippling sanctions. > > The Obama administration dangled billions of dollars through the cRace to the Top competition, and the grant-making process not so subtly encouraged states to adopt the Common Core State Standards. With a price tag of nearly four and a half billion dollars, it was billed as the clargest- ever federal investment in school reform. Later, the Department would give states a waiver from NCLB 9s requirements so long as they adopted the Obama administration 9s preferred policies 4 essentially making law while Congress negotiated the reauthorization of ESEA. > > Unsurprisingly, nearly every state accepted Common Core standards and applied for hundreds of millions of dollars in cRace to the Top funds. But despite this change, the United States 9 PISA performance did not improve in reading and science, and it dropped in math from 2012 to 2015. > > Then, rightly, came the public backlash to federally imposed tests and the Common Core. I agree 4 and have always agreed 4 with President Trump on this: cCommon Core is a disaster. And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead. > > On a parallel track, the Obama administration 9s School Improvement Grants sought to fix targeted schools by injecting them with cash. The total cost of that effort was seven billion dollars. > > One year ago this week, the Department 9s Institute of Education Sciences released a report on what came of all that spending. It said: cOverall, across all grades, we found that implementing any SIG-funded model had no significant impacts on math or reading test scores, high school graduation, or college enrollment. > > There we have it: billions of dollars directed at low-performing schools had no significant impact on student achievement. > > These investments were meant to spark meaningful reforms. Schools were encouraged to significantly alter their teaching staffs, fire the principal or change the structure and model of the school. But most glossed over those recommendations. They simply took the federal money and ran the school the same old way. > > So where does that leave us? We saw two presidents from different political parties and philosophies take two different approaches. > > Federally mandated assessments. Federal money. Federal standards. All originated in Washington, and none solved the problem. Too many of America 9s students are still unprepared. > > Perhaps the lesson lies not in what made the approaches different, but in what made them the same: the federal government. Both approaches had the same Washington cexperts telling educators how to behave. > > The lesson is in the false premise: that Washington knows what 9s best for educators, parents and students. > > Rick, you 9ve rightly pointed out that the federal government is good at making states, districts, and schools do something, but it 9s not good at making them do it well. Getting real results for students hinges on how that csomething is done. > > That 9s because when it comes to education 4 and any other issue in public life 4 those closest to the problem are always better able to solve it. Washington bureaucrats and self-styled education cexperts are about as far removed from students as you can get. > > Yet under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Washington overextended itself time and time again. > > Educators don 9t need engineering from Washington. Parents don 9t need prescriptions from Washington. Students don 9t need standards from Washington. > > Throughout both initiatives, the result was a further damaged classroom dynamic between teacher and student, as the focus shifted from comprehension to test-passing. This sadly has taken root, with the American Federation of Teachers recently finding that 60 percent of its teachers reported having moderate to no influence over the content and skills taught in their own classrooms. > > Let that sink in. Most teachers feel they have little 4 if any 4 say in their own classrooms. > > That statistic should shock even the most ardent sycophant of cthe system. It 9s yet another reason why we should shift power over classrooms from Washington back to teachers who know their students well. > > Federal mandates distort what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. > > Ideally, parent and teacher work together to help a child discover his or her potential and pursue his or her passions. When we seek to empower teachers, we must empower parents as well. Parents are too often powerless in deciding what 9s best for their child. The state mandates where to send their child. It mandates what their child learns and how he or she learns it. In the same way, educators are constrained by state mandates. District mandates. Building mandates . . . all kinds of other mandates! Educators don 9t need Washington mandating their teaching on top of everything else. > > But during the years covered in your volume, the focus was the opposite: more federal government intrusion into relationships between teachers, parents and children. > > The lessons of history should force us to admit that federal action has its limits. > > The federal-first approach did not start with No Child Left Behind. The push for higher national standards was present in the Clinton administration 9s cGoals 2000 initiative. Before that, we had President George H.W. Bush 9s cAmerica 2000, also calling for higher national standards. These followed the Reagan administration 9s cNation at Risk report, released in 1983. That report gave dire warnings about the country 9s track if education was not reformed. cIf an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, the report warned, cwe might well have viewed it as an act of war. That came after President Carter 9s giant nod to union bosses: the establishment of the Department of Education, with the ironic charge to cprohibit federal control of education. > > The trend is evident. Politicians from both parties just can 9t help themselves. They have talked about painting education in new colors and even broader strokes. But each time, reform has not fundamentally changed cthe system. Each attempt has really just been a new coat of paint on the same old wall. > > When we try the same thing over and over again, yet expect different results, that 9s not reform 3 that 9s insanity. > > We will not reach our goal of helping every child achieve his or her fullest potential until we truly change. Let me offer three ways we can move forward in that pursuit. > > First, we need to recognize that the federal government 9s appropriate role is not to be the nation 9s school board. My role is not to be the national superintendent nor the country 9s cchoice chief 4 regardless of what the union 9s cChicken Littles may say! Federal investments in education, after all, are less than 10 percent of total K-12 expenditures, but the burdens created by federal regulations in education amount to a much, much larger percentage. > > The Every Student Succeeds Act charted a path in a new direction. ESSA takes important steps to return power where it belongs by recognizing states 4 not Washington 4 should shape education policy around their own people. But state lawmakers should also resist the urge to centrally plan education. cLeave it to the states may be a compelling campaign-season slogan, but state capitols aren 9t exactly close to every family either. That 9s why states should empower teachers and parents and provide the same flexibility ESSA allows states. > > But let 9s recognize that many states are now struggling with what comes next. State ESSA plans aren 9t the finish line. Those words on paper mean very little if state and local leaders don 9t seize the opportunity to truly transform education. They must move past a mindset of compliance and embrace individual empowerment. > > Under ESSA, school leaders, educators and parents have the latitude and freedom to try new approaches to serve individual students. > > My message to them is simple: do it! > > Embrace the imperative to do something truly bold . . . to challenge the status quo . . . to break the mold. > > One important way to start this process is to make sure that parents get the information they want and need about the performance of their children 9s schools and teachers. ESSA encourages states to be transparent about how money is spent, down to the school-building level. > > Some states have developed information that is truly useful for parents and teachers. Others have worked just as hard to obfuscate what is really going on at their schools. To empower parents, policymakers and teachers, we can 9t let cthe system hide behind complexity to escape accountability. > > We must always push for better. > > ESSA is a good step in the right direction. But it 9s just that 4 a step. We still find ourselves boxed in a csystem, one where we are in a constant battle to move the ball between the 40-yard lines of a football field. Nobody scores, and nobody wins. Students are left bored in the bleachers, and many leave, never to return. > > So why don 9t we consider whether we need a new playbook? > > That brings me to point number two. And, to finish the analogy . . . let 9s call a new play: empowering parents. > > Parents have the greatest stake in the outcome of their child 9s education. Accordingly, they should also have the power to make sure their child is getting the right education. > > As Deven Carlson points out, there is little constituency in America for the top-down reforms that have been tried time and again. In order for any reform to truly work, it must attract and maintain the support of the people. > > I have seen such support for parental empowerment. The more parents exercise it, the more they like it. This growing support is why states are responding to that demand one by one. It 9s also why sycophants entrenched in and defending the status quo are terrified. They recoil from relinquishing power and control to teachers, parents and students. > > Well, I 9m not one bit afraid of losing power. Because I trust parents and teachers, and I believe in students. > > Equal access to a quality education should be a right for every American and every parent should have the right to choose how their child is educated. Government exists to protect those rights, not usurp them. > > So let 9s face it: The opponents of parents could repeal every voucher law, close every charter school, and defund every choice program across the country. > > But school choice still wouldn 9t go away. There would still be school choices\\u2026 for the affluent and the powerful. > > Let 9s empower the forgotten parents to decide where their children go to school. Let 9s show some humility and trust all parents to know their kids 9 needs better than we do. > > Let 9s trust teachers, too. Let 9s encourage them to innovate, to create new options for students. Not just with public charter schools or magnet schools or private schools, but within the traditional csystem and with new approaches yet to be explored. > > What we 9ve been doing isn 9t serving all kids well. Let 9s unleash teachers to help solve the problem. > > You know, I 9ve never heard it claimed that giving parents more options is bad for mom and dad. Or for the child. What you hear is that it 9s bad for cthe system 3 for the school building, the school system, the funding stream. > > That argument speaks volumes about where Chicken Little 9s priorities lie. > > Our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. They deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced, and challenging life-long learning journey. Schools should be open to all students 3 no matter where they 9re growing up or how much their parents make. > > That means no more discrimination based upon zip code or socio-economic status. All means all. > > It 9s about educational freedom! Freedom from Washington mandates. Freedom from centralized control. Freedom from a one-size-fits-all mentality. Freedom from cthe system. > > Choice in education is not when a student picks a different classroom in this building or that building, uses this voucher or that tax-credit scholarship. Choice in education is bigger than that. Those are just mechanisms. > > It 9s about freedom to learn. Freedom to learn differently. Freedom to explore. Freedom to fail, to learn from falling and to get back up and try again. It 9s freedom to find the best way to learn and grow . . . to find the exciting and engaging combination that unlocks individual potential. > > Which leads to my final point: if America 9s students are to be prepared, we must rethink school. > > What I propose is not another top-down, federal government policy that promises to be a silver bullet. No. We need a paradigm shift, a fundamental reorientation . . . a rethink. > > cRethink means we question everything to ensure nothing limits a student from pursuing his or her passion, and achieving his or her potential. So each student is prepared at every turn for what comes next. > > It 9s past time to ask some of the questions that often get labeled as cnon-negotiable or just don 9t get asked at all: > > Why do we group students by age? > > Why do schools close for the summer? > > Why must the school day start with the rise of the sun? > > Why are schools assigned by your address? > > Why do students have to go to a school building in the first place? > > Why is choice only available to those who can buy their way out? Or buy their way in? > > Why can 9t a student learn at his or her own pace? > > Why isn 9t technology more widely embraced in schools? > > Why do we limit what a student can learn based upon the faculty and facilities available? > > Why? > > We must answer these questions. We must acknowledge what is and what is not working for students. > > Now, I don 9t have all the answers or policy prescriptions. No one person does. But people do know how to help their neighbors. People do know how they can help a dozen students here or 100 there. Because they know the students. They know their home lives. They know their communities. They know their parents. They know each other. > > That means learning can, should, and will look different for each unique child. And we should celebrate that, not fear it! > > I 9m well aware that change 4 the unknown 4 can be scary. That talk of fundamentally rethinking our approach to education seems impossible, insurmountable. > > But not changing is scarier. Stagnation creates risks of its own. The reality is . . . we should be horrified of not changing. > > Our children don 9t fear their futures. Think of a newborn, born into hope 4 not fear. They begin life with a clean slate. With a fresh set of eyes to see things we don 9t currently see. That 9s how students begin their lifelong learning journeys . . . with unlimited potential . . . yet with limited time. > > Their dreams, their hopes, their aspirations, their futures can 9t wait, while another wave of lawmakers puts yet another coat of paint on the broken csystem. One year may not seem like much to an adult, but it 9s much too long for the child who still can 9t read cGoodnight Moon. > > We, the public, can 9t wait either. Education is good for the public. > > Everything else 4 our health, our economy, our continued security as a nation 4 depends on what we do today for the leaders of tomorrow. It follows, then, that any educator in any learning environment serves the public good. If the purpose of public education is to educate the public, then it should\\u2026 not\\u2026 matter what word comes before school. > > What matters are the students the school serves. What matters are their futures. We 9ve been entrusted with their futures not because we asked to be, but because it 9s a duty to destiny 3 theirs . . . and ours. It all depends on what we do now. > > When our grandchildren tell their children about this moment in history, let them say we were the ones who finally put students first. > > Thank you, and I look forward to this conversation.

        "article": " Dr. Arnold Gold, a pediatric neurologist whose belief in the importance of an empathetic bedside manner led him and his wife to create a foundation to inspire young doctors to practice compassionate patient care, died on Jan. 23 in Manhattan. He was 92. , His wife, Sandra Gold, confirmed his death. ,  cYou 9re only half a physician if you 9re just good at your craft, Dr. Gold said in an interview in 2016 for the Arnold P. Gold Foundation(http://www.gold-foundation.org/). cUnless it 9s coupled with patient-centered care and humanism, it 9s suboptimal care. , Dr. Gold, who treated patients and taught for more than 50 years at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons(http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/education/physicians_surgeons), part of Columbia University Medical Center, had a cheerful but authoritative demeanor. On rounds, he wanted to know about the life of the patient, not just his vital signs. He talked face to face with his young patients, often sitting on the floor and playing with them. ,  cHe enjoyed kids and he dealt with them in a wondrous way, Dr. David Mandelbaum, a former student of Dr. Gold 9s at Columbia who is a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the Brown University Alpert Medical School, said in a telephone interview. cHe always sensed what a kid was able to do, not what he couldn 9t do. , He was also concerned with the patients 9 parents, spending time, for example, to understand the effects that a neurologically damaged child 9s condition had on their marriage and finances. And if he could not give them hope, he gave them answers. ,  cHe told me the worst news in the most loving way, Amy Gleicher said in a telephone interview, recalling Dr. Gold 9s diagnosis concerning her year-old son, Max, in 1993. cHe told me my son was mentally retarded in such a way that I had dignity and my child had value. , Dr. Gold continued his humane approach as advances like M.R.I. 9s and CT scans revolutionized medicine. But he became distressed in the 1970s and 980s, he said, as he watched students and other doctors become too focused on technology and not enough on the people they were treating. ,  cSo one day in 1988, he said in the 2016 interview, cI was making rounds with the students and residents and a student presented me 8the brain tumor in 209. 9 And I said: 8The brain tumor? Isn 9t there a child involved in this? Tell me about the child, tell me about the family. Tell me how this is impacting on the family. Do you know any of this? 9 They did not, he said. , At home that night, he told his wife of his concerns about where medicine was headed. As he recalled, she told him, cYou know, Arnold, I 9m tired of you griping about medicine. _Do_ something about it or shut up. , They began the Arnold P. Gold Foundation together in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in 1988, hoping to clone Dr. Gold 9s humane approach to patient engagement. They started white-coat ceremonies at medical schools(http://www .gold-foundation.org/what-do-medical-students-hope-to-remember-about-their- white-coat-ceremony/) in which students pledge the Hippocratic oath in the early days of their education, rather than at graduation, as is common practice. Dr. Gold felt that graduation was too late to set expectations for the clinicians they would become. ,  cThis should be established at Day 1, he said in the interview. , Arnold Perlman Gold was born in Manhattan on Aug. 8, 1925. His father, Michael, a Jewish native of Dublin, and his mother, the former Rebecca Perlman, were lawyers. As a youngster, Arnold read cArrowsmith, Sinclair Lewis 9s 1925 novel about a doctor 9s search for truth. ,  cArnold was very idealistic and wanted to save the world, said Dr. Brian Benson, Dr. Gold 9s son-in-law, cand he was very impacted by that book. , In 1938, when Arnold was 13, his father died, and his mother sent him to live with an aunt in Galveston, Tex., believing that he might get a better chance at an education there. He attended the University of Texas, Austin, but left to serve stateside in World War II as a Navy corpsman. , He later graduated from the University of Texas, studied for a master 9s at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and earned his medical degree from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. , During his internship at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Dr. Gold tended to 30 children with polio who were in iron lungs. His mentor there, Dr. Margaret Smith, ctaught me a lot about patient-centered care, and she also led me into the field of pediatrics, he said in 2016. ,  cI was originally going to be an internist, an endocrinologist, he said. , When he was chief resident at Cincinnati Children 9s Hospital, part of his work placed him in Dr. Albert Sabin 9s laboratory while Dr. Sabin(http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0826.html \"His obituary.\") was developing the oral polio vaccine. While in Cincinnati, Dr. Gold rode horseback for the Frontier Nursing Service to treat people in rural Kentucky. , He returned to New York as visiting chief resident at the Babies Hospital(http://www.nyp.org/morganstanley/about-us/history) at the NewYork Presbyterian-Columbia University campus (now Morgan Stanley Children 9s Hospital) before beginning his long career at Columbia in child neurology. , Dr. Gold lived with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which affected his muscles later in his life and made it difficult for him to breathe. He treated patients until he was 88 and spoke at last year 9s white-coat ceremony at the(http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2017/08/14/ps-community-welcomes- class-2021-white-coat-ceremony/) College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia. , Besides his wife, the former Sandra Orenberg, who has a doctorate in counseling, he is survived by two daughters, Amelia Gold and Maggie Gold Seelig; a stepdaughter, Jennifer Arnold; a stepson, Stephen Silver; and 13 grandchildren. His stepson Jeffrey Silver died(http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/community-mourns-passing-of- pure-soul/) in 2010. , Dr. Gold recalled that in creating his foundation, his goal was to change the course of medical education. ,  cMy colleagues were very distressed, he recalled in the 2016 interview. cThey looked at me as sort of, 8What 9s happening to Arnold? 9 And one of them even said to me, 8I think you 9re smoking opium, 9 and, 8How could you ever believe that you can change medicine? 9 People were not very encouraging. , But 30 years later, the foundation said, more than 170 medical schools and physician assistant programs hold white-coat ceremonies annually. More than 260 nursing schools hold similar gatherings. , The foundation has also inducted 30,000 students, residents and faculty into its Gold Humanism Honor Society to recognize their compassionate patient care. The designation became prestigious enough for medical students to include it in applications for residencies. , Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, the president and chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said in an email that the honor society cdemonstrates that, increasingly, the medical profession recognizes humanistic attributes such as empathy and compassion as being every bit as important as academic achievement. , He added, cThis is just one more element of Dr. Gold 9s outstanding legacy.

Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said that \"choosing to ignore the rights of transgender students and to not enforce Title IX when it comes to their protection is an unambiguous step backwards for civil rights in this country.\" The development, which was first reported by BuzzFeed News(https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/edu-dept-trans-student- bathrooms?utm_term=.afY251de6.ctYNZRj6r), was widely criticized by civil rights groups, who said it could endanger the welfare of transgender students. \"While civil rights advocates have suspected that the Department of Education was not acting on complaints brought forward by transgender students, reports that these violations are completely being ignored are reprehensible,\" said HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow. \"The department's failure to act conflicts with the law in multiple jurisdictions, including federal circuits, and further emboldens those who seek to discriminate against transgender students. Once again, Secretary Betsy DeVos proves she is not interested in protecting transgender students and instead is choosing to advance the dangerous Trump- Pence anti-LGBTQ agenda.\" Eliza Byard, the executive director of GLSEN, called the Department of Education's decision not to investigate the complaints \"cruel\" and said the department's policies were \"hurting transgender students in concrete and far- reaching ways.\" \"Congress created the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education in order to ensure that marginalized and vulnerable students had a champion. Under Secretary DeVos, the office has abdicated that solemn responsibility for transgender youth,\" Byard said. \"OCR's cruel new policy flies in the face of the highest court rulings on this issue, which found unequivocally that denying transgender students appropriate bathroom access is a violation of Title IX.\"  ",

But economists, surely, inhabit planet Earth, surveying it dispassionately. Alas, a new paper suggests that even dismal scientists divide on gender lines. Ann Mari May and Mary McGarvey of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and David Kucera of the International Labour Organisation surveyed economists from 18 European countries, and found that differences in the wider population can survive even an economics education. Male economists are more likely than female ones to prefer market solutions to government intervention, are more sceptical of environmental protection, and are (slightly) less keen on redistribution (see chart).  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Women were 14 percentage points less likely to agree that Walmart generates net benefits, and 30 points more likely to agree that American openness to trade should be tied to higher labour standards abroad. Perhaps the divergence does not matter. Good economics should, after all, involve using theory and data to quell prejudices. But some evidence suggests that ideology seeps into economists 9 work. Zubin Jelveh of the University of Chicago, Suresh Naidu of Columbia University and Bruce Kogut of Columbia Business School parse the language used in economics papers to identify the authors 9 predilections, and confirm that they match their participation in political petitions. They find that right-wing economists tend to produce estimates that fit their anti-interventionist views. Other data crunched by Mr Naidu confirm that women use more left-leaning language than men. The differences in opinion are cause for concern when the overwhelming preponderance of men in the economics profession is taken into account. Ms May and her co-authors found that men in their sample were twice as likely to be full professors as women. If economists 9 senior ranks are skewed in favour of men, then the profession 9s output might also be biased towards results they find appealing. A final difference that Ms May and her co-authors uncover suggests one reason why economists might dismiss gender differences as a problem. Male economists are relatively likely to think that men and women face equal job opportunities generally, and that pay gaps are largely explained by differences in skills and choice. By contrast, women are more likely to perceive unequal opportunities, both in general and specifically within academia. If women hold different views to men, then that could put them at odds with the profession 9s more senior gatekeepers. And if men are more likely to have faith in markets to nudge women to the best jobs, then they could be more resistant to the idea that the gender imbalance is a problem that needs solving. Men were also more sceptical than women that greater gender balance in research teams would improve economic knowledge. Of course, some differences of opinion need not necessarily reflect well on women. It might be that they suffer from cmotivated reasoning d, believing that their lack of promotion is because of the system rather than their own shortcomings, or that economics would benefit from more people like them. Alternatively, their personal experiences could give them information that men do not have. It seems plausible that men are susceptible to motivated reasoning too. It is easier to attribute one 9s success to hard work than to unfair privilege. Even the most brilliant of economists can be blind to their own biases. In 1960 George Stigler, a late Nobel laureate and dogged empiricist, bemoaned the cdeleterious effects of economists 9 policy desires on their theory, but maintained that overall, as a positive science, economics was ethically and politically neutral. Yet some of his own views fell short of this ideal. Susan Brandwayn, one of his former students and now an independent economist, remembers Mr Stigler telling her class that the day the University of Chicago 9s economics faculty hired a woman was the day that he would leave.  _ **Correction (February 25th 2018):** An earlier version of this piece referred to Susan Brandwayn as one of George Stigler 9s graduate students and suggested he had made his comment about the hiring of women to her. In fact he was speaking to her class in graduate school._ This article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Battle of the X 9s\"  ",

England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed \\xa370m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities.    It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North.   * Is there a north-south divide in schools?(/news/education-38172816)   * Osborne urges action on north-south divide(/news/business-42893861)  The commissioner's research also finds:   * too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up   * more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good   * large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18   * there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities  Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. * * *  Teenagers' concerns Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. \"There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,\" said Hafsah. \"Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south.  !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p062dkf7.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionHow Northern students see North-South education gap \"It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. \"It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. \"For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out. But it's not fair.\" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. \"A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. \"So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you.\" Qasim added: \"If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education.

She added: \"Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. \"There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. \"Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives.\"  Image copyrightOffice of the Children's CommissionerImage caption The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England  Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. \"The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do.\" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. \"We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. \"So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. \"Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. \"The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools.\"  'More to do' The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as \"Opportunity Areas\" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: \"We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. \"As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. \"Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes \\xa33.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, \\xa312m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home.\" The government has also committed \\xa370m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. \"By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England\"   ",

(Maria Danilova/AP) The Trump administration 9s 2019 budget proposal for the U.S. Education Department was just released, and it shows the continuing support that President Trump and Secretary Betsy DeVos have for expanding school choice, or alternatives to traditional public education. For the second year in a row, the administration has proposed slashing the department 9s budget while spending more than $1 billion on vouchers 4 which use public money for private and religious schools 4 and other choice programs. Congress may not approve the request, but it shows Trump 9s and DeVos 9s priorities. _ DeVos seeks cuts from Education Department to support school choice (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/devos-seeks- massive-cuts-from-education-department-to-support-school- choice/?utm_term=.2d61b70c2e0d)_ Charter schools and vouchers are well-known choice alternatives, but there are others that are less familiar, including what 9s called cEducation Savings Accounts, or ESAs. They may become more popular in states as the billionaire Koch brothers and their network plan to spend millions of dollars to push them and other efforts to privatize public education. ESAs are personal accounts created by a state for parents to use for a range of educational costs 4 including private school tuition and fees, as well as private tutoring 4 with state education funds. The trend in ESAs is that there is no means test, part of a larger shift in some parts of the school choice movement from advocating for choice being for low-income students to escape failing traditional public schools to choice being for all families. This is the vision that conservatives, such as the Kochs and DeVos and her longtime ally, former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), want to see become reality throughout the United States. Critics say that a publicly funded school system that is open to all students cannot function without stable budgets that would be disrupted by such a choice program. Here is a primer on ESAs written by Carol Burris, a former award-winning New York high school principal who is executive director of the Network for Public Education(https://networkforpubliceducation.org/), a nonprofit advocacy group. Burris was named the 2010 Educator of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State, and\\xa0in 2013, the National Association of Secondary School Principals named her the New York State High School Principal of the Year. Burris has been chronicling problems with modern school reform and school choice for years on this blog. She has previously written about problems with charter schools in California and a number of other states. _ What 8school choice 9 means in the era of Trump and DeVos (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/22/what-school- choice-means-in-the-era-of-trump-and-devos/?utm_term=.58cd4fa382c7)_ _**By Carol Burris**_ > _ cMy personal opinion is that the 12,000 or 13,000 government-run, unionized, politicized monopolies 4 we call them school districts 4 is not the best governance model for the world we 9re moving towards. 4 Jeb Bush_ The above definition of a public school district was given by former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) at a recent panel on Education Savings Accounts(http://www.aei.org/events/education-savings-accounts-jeb-bush-on- the-future-of-educational-choice-2/) at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. At the event, Bush, who was a pioneer in the education reform movement that relied on high-stakes standardized tests for evaluation purposes and on the Common Core State Standards, argued that states should give parents tax dollars on a debit card to buy customized education services as an alternative to public schools. The marketplace would be in charge. Parents, he said, would be cthe regulators. Welcome to the world of Education Savings Accounts, often referred to as ESAs. If you are not familiar with Education Savings Accounts, you should be. During a recent three-day seminar in Indian Wells, Calif.,(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/?utm_term=.ad7c0c96ef50) hosted by the billionaire Koch brothers, ESAs were announced as one of their identified legislative priorities of 2018. And they have already gotten started. The Koch 9s 501(c)4, Americans for Prosperity, is pouring millions into an effort to defeat a November ballot referendum to overturn the expansion of ESAs in Arizona. _ The Daily 202: Koch network laying groundwork to fundamentally transform America 9s education system (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/)_ Last year, the Arizona legislature narrowly passed a bill making ESAs eventually available to all K-12 students in the state\\xa0 4 despite reports(https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona- education/2017/01/31/arizona-school-vouchers-expansion-audit/97163702/)\\xa0of lax oversight and fraudulent spending in the state 9s small existing program. Following the passage of the bill, a scrappy group of parents and teachers came together to form Save Our Schools Arizona(https://sosarizona.org/), gathering enough signatures to put ESAs up for a public vote. The Kochs have fought to shut down the referendum in the courts and on the airwaves ever since. Of all the various school privatization programs, Educational Savings Accounts are the most market-based and the least accountable. What they ultimately do is reduce society 9s obligation to educate our nation 9s youth to the dropping of tax dollars onto a debit card. There are six states with ESA programs: Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Nevada. Nevada 9s program is nonoperational and unfunded. In a seventh state, New Hampshire, ESAs are likely to be approved this year. Last year, more than 20 state legislatures introduced ESA bills, with the proposed programs nearly always going by a different name. For example, ESAs are called Gardiner Scholarships in Florida, Individualized Education Accounts in Tennessee and Empowerment Scholarship Accounts in Arizona. Despite the different names, intended to hide the joint effort by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful conservative organization, to promote the same basic bill, they operate in similar ways. _ This ALEC state report card speaks volumes about Betsy DeVos 9s education agenda (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/08/13/this-alec-state-report-card-speaks-volumes-about-betsy- devoss-education-agenda/?utm_term=.c059f6c08804)_ Parents pledge not to enroll their son or daughter in a public school or a charter school. In exchange, they get nearly all of what the school would have spent (usually 90 percent) placed on a debit card or in an account. The remaining 10 percent is used to fund program administration. Parents can use the money for private or religious school tuition, online learning, books, hippotherapy (horseback riding for therapeutic purposes) and home schooling 4 or they can choose to spend minimal dollars on K-12 education and save for college. There is no obligation that the curriculum that is used to teach students who use ESAs to attend private schools be developmentally appropriate, challenging or even accurate. Although a few states require parents to promise that their children receive instruction in reading, grammar, mathematics, science and social studies, what content is taught and what is learned is immaterial. If at this point you are thinking that most taxpayers would view such an unaccountable and unregulated system as one in which families could easily be victimized by misinformation, false claims, profiteering and fraud, you would be right. This is not lost on the proponents of ESAs. That is why they have developed all kinds of language to make ESAs seem hip and cutting-edge, when they are really advocating a return to a time before the 1830s when schooling was a haphazard event for all but the wealthy. **The Language of the cCustomizers d** The AEI panel that Bush introduced provided insight into how proponents cmarket ESAs. Lindsey Burke of the Heritage Foundation(https://www.heritage.org/) referred to many ESA parents as ccustomizers who buy ca la carte education with their debit card. According to Burke, 20 percent of all Florida ESA students never set foot in a bricks-and-mortar school, which she enthusiastically embraced as success. Adam Peshek of Bush 9s Foundation for Excellence in Education(https://www.excelined.org/) proposed that individual teachers go into business for themselves by recruiting students for their cmicro schools. He suggested that they could charge students $100 a session to attend. ESAs, he said, will lead to the cnext generation of accountability modeled after Yelp and Urbanspoon. Peshek views ESAs as a gamble in innovation, saying that ESAs allow cyou to make small bets in education where if it works, great. And cif it doesn 9t work, no problem, because you 9re making small bets and you 9re adjusting in real time. But there is a problem he didn 9t mention. Those csmall bets are made at kids 9 expense. Panelist Jonathan Beckam of Step Up for Students(https://www.stepupforstudents.org/) described how his organization, with the help of ctwo big companies, created cthe largest online marketplace for ESAs. Here is how he described his work: > cSo from a family 9s perspective, it 9s really like an Amazon shopping experience. I can log on to this private marketplace. I can see thousands of products and services that are preapproved for acceptable use for my program. I can click into those products and get detailed product information and availability for it. I can add it to my shopping cart and check out using my ESA funds directly. When the panel was over, it was time for questions. An earnest young man from the University of Georgia asked the following: > cThe University of Georgia is in one of the poorest counties in the state of Georgia: Adams Clark County. A bunch of parents are working two, three jobs to help their children get by and to, you know, possibly save up so their children can get a better life than they did. My question for you is: With all of these programs, with this $21,000 you were talking about, how do you work with giving the parents the time to get as involved as we would want them to be? How would we 4 how do you work with giving the parents the time as well as that money? The host responded: cI will hold off that. Thank you for that one, and we 9ll take a question here. All of the talk of customization, a la carte services and the glorification of choice, is designed to entice parents to support what many people see as an unsustainable and irresponsible system were it to become widescale. ESAs are a mechanism to change the way we fund education by assigning each child a backpack full of cash. How much is in the backpack would be determined by the state. Over time, if parents want more than some basic educational services, they would need to kick in money themselves. It is the Chilean model. As money is drained from school districts, services go down, resulting in more students exiting with their funding, leaving still less for those who remain. Beth Lewis, one of the co-founders of SOS Arizona, knows exactly what happens over time when school choice becomes the means to undermine public education.  cIn the past two decades in Arizona, we 9ve seen millions of public dollars diverted to private schools through ESA vouchers and other programs, she said. cIn this same time period, our state leaders have strategically divested in our public schools, driving us down to 49th in the nation in teacher pay and per-student spending. Arizona is a cautionary tale of what can (and will) go wrong with the privatization of our public schools. And there is no reason to believe that the Koch brothers and other right-wing libertarians such as the DeVos family will stop with public schools. As Texan Stacy Hock told The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/?utm_term=.e81227228508)at the Kochs 9 Indian Wells soiree, K-12 education is on the agenda because it is the clowest-hanging fruit for policy change in the United States. Easy pickings may not be final pickings for those who want to commercialize every aspect of America 9s public services.  ",

        "article": "  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deployed a new weapon at the Olympics to fight back against the Trump administration 9s sanctions and threats of a preemptive strike against his nuclear program: His sister. Kim Yo Jong shook hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, cheered enthusiastically for a unified Korean team, and displayed a sense of humor in weekend meetings. She also delivered a letter inviting(https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-10/kim-jong-un- invites-south-korea-s-moon-to-summit-in-pyongyang \"Kim Summit Invitation to South Korea May Ease Peninsula Tensions\") Moon to a summit with her brother in Pyongyang, and asked him to play a cleading role in reuniting the two Koreas after nearly seven decades.  cI never expected to come here on such short notice to be honest, and I thought it would be strange and different but it 9s not, Kim Yo Jong said at a dinner Sunday night before heading home. cThere are many things similar and the same. I hope we can quickly become one and meet these good people again in Pyongyang.     The warm words were aimed at further exploiting divisions between the U.S. and South Korea, which differ on the best way to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. Her visit amounted to a charm offensive designed to counter the U.S. narrative that Kim Jong Un is a madman who tortures his own people and would blow up Los Angeles or New York City if he didn 9t get his way. North Korea 9s participation in the Olympics has already allowed Kim Jong Un to undermine President Donald Trump 9s pressure campaign, with some sanctions suspended temporarily until the event ends. In pushing for a summit with Moon, Kim is seeking to consolidate those gains while maintaining his nuclear arsenal to deter a U.S. invasion. The question now is whether the U.S. and South Korea can stay united in keeping up the pressure on North Korea just as sanctions limiting export revenue and curbing fuel imports start to bite. While Trump 9s advisers have threatened military action to prevent Kim from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon, Moon is seeking to prevent a war that could devastate South Korea and the region. Kim 9s proposal for a summit was ca brilliant diplomatic maneuver, said Andrei Lankov, a historian at Kookmin University in Seoul who once studied in Pyongyang. Moon would irritate Trump if he accepts the invitation, while declining would make the U.S. and South Korea appear cunreasonably bellicose, he said. How North Korea Managed to Crash the Olympics Party(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/the-koreas-get-in- the-olympic-spirit-for-now \"Click for full story\")      cThe proposal, as well as North Korea 9s presence at the Games, sends a signal that the North Koreans are ready to talk, Lankov said. cAnd this signal helps the opponents of a military operation in Washington and elsewhere. Signs of discord in the U.S.-South Korea alliance were evident immediately after the announcement. Moon 9s office initially provided conflicting accounts of whether he accepted the invitation, with a Blue House spokesperson later clarifying that pre-conditions first needed to be met. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence didn 9t discuss the invitation with Moon Saturday while they watched a speed-skating event, a senior White House official said. Speaking to reporters later, Pence reiterated that there was cno daylight between the U.S., South Korea and Japan in pushing to isolate North Korea until Kim abandons his nuclear program.  Pence Talks Later on, Pence told the Washington Post that the U.S. is ready to engage in talks about North Korea 9s nuclear program even as it maintains pressure on Kim 9s regime. In the interview, he said Moon assured him that the North Koreans wouldn 9t get economic or diplomatic benefits for just talking 4 only for taking concrete steps toward denuclearization. Moon came to power promising a softer approach to Pyongyang and has repeatedly sought a summit with Kim Jong Un. Moon initially opposed U.S. plans to deploy a missile shield in South Korea, and last year vowed to prevent war at all costs after Trump threatened cfire and fury against North Korea. Moon faces the risk of a backlash at home if he goes too far. His approval ratings, while still high at 63 percent, fell after he pushed for a unified women 9s ice hockey team for the two Koreas. Conservative groups have protested the appearance of North Korean athletes at the Games in Pyeongchang with vulgar signs.  8Wild Dream 9 South Korea 9s Unification Ministry said Monday that the dialogue would be led by the two Koreas with cooperation and support from international partners. South Korea cwill faithfully implement the international sanctions on North Korea, while also adhering to the principle of resolution through peaceful means, it said. North Korea has shown no signs it 9s willing to discuss denuclearization. Its negotiators protested last month when South Koreans raised the issue during talks over the Olympics, a line North Korea 9s state-run media has reiterated. Last week, a commentary published by the Korean Central News Agency called denuclearization ca wild dream that can never come true. Moon won 9t have much space to negotiate with North Korea without backing from the U.S.,\\xa0said Christopher Green, senior adviser on the Korean peninsula at the International Crisis Group in Amsterdam.  cHis goal is to do enough on the inter-Korean front to get the United States and North Korea to jaw-jaw, Green said. cThe real strategic games have only just begun.  _ 4 With assistance by Sohee Kim, and Toluse Olorunnipa_   ",

        "article": " But for the latter movement, stories of officer-involved shootings were dismissed at first as gratuitous race-baiting, then as exceptional cautionary tales, then as isolated incidents, then as pleas not to allow one bad apple to spoil the bunch. The court of public opinion was slow to grant validity, eventually yielding only to numbers tabulated in headstones. But in the post-MeToo era, it seems the tide has changed. Anecdotes are sufficient; formal due process is perhaps optional. Deaf ears are now empathetic, and unwilling to entertain the notion that misconduct could ever be \"justifiable.\" What matters is listening to ensure that no one else will find their loved one's name next to a hashtag. Find it ironic? Me too. !Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180110130620-02-catherine-deneuve- file-large-169.jpg)(/2018/01/10/opinions/le-monde-letter-catherine-deneuve- perez-opinion/index.html) Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(/2018/01/10/opinions/le-monde-letter-catherine-deneuve-perez- opinion/index.html) But Justice Ginsburg's revelation was hardly intended to identify a powerful irony. It was intended to acknowledge the powerful force of momentum. The Supreme Court hears but a lean fraction of cases seeking its review. Among the factors (https://www.supremecourt.gov/filingandrules/2017RulesoftheCourt.pdf)it considers is the divisiveness of the issue presented, the impact of the court's holding on the nation, and whether the conduct at issue offends our collective constitutional principles. But as landmark civil rights cases like Brown v. Board of Education or Lawrence v. Texas demonstrate, momentum has a way of catapulting an issue to the front of the figurative queue. But sometimes momentum yields unfortunate results. Before invalidating a key provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get pre-authorization from the Department of Justice before making any changes to its voting laws, for instance, Chief Justice John Roberts implied(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/holder-v-roberts) the election of black men and women to political office placed us in a post-racial world that no longer required this kind of government oversight. Ginsburg correctly dissented, arguing instead that such protections were necessary in spite of perceptions of progress. She, like others who have experienced discrimination, understood that pruning the tree of oppression doesn't destroy its roots. Milestones, no matter how significant, should neither be blindly touted nor used as an excuse to call off the watchdogs. It should shock and offend you that a nation this old should still be patted on the back for taking its first steps. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the MeToo movement seems to prompt such visceral reactions. People believed that we were in a post-gender world. We're not. People are surprised to learn that democratic principles of equality remain aspirational, and elude huge segments of our population. Even 45 years after the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade, the right of women to exercise autonomy over their bodies remains vulnerable to political attack. The litmus test for whether you believe in equality is not whether one wears a pin; it is whether you understand that equality is the linchpin of a democratic society.

Almost half of students from the fifth grade cannot read texts meant for second-graders. Private tutors are called upon. Buses are plastered with ads for cramming institutes claiming to have coached exam ctoppers d, a status that rivals cricket superstardom. (A rival to Byju 9s is inevitably called Toppr.) According to one estimate, a quarter of all Indian students attend private coaching classes. Byju Raveendran should know. A few years ago, he used to attract 25,000 students to a particular stadium in Delhi, and fly to nine cities every week to teach high-school maths. Youngsters would learn shortcuts and tips to ace the fiendishly hard Common Admission Test for the best schools. Given the enormous size of the classrooms, it was impossible to make the sessions interactive, so Mr Raveendran came up with the idea of converting the lessons into video gobbets and hosting them online. The business has 900,000 paid users who spend over 50 minutes on the app each day 4metrics that media firms might envy. Around nine-tenths of customers of Byju 9s renew subscriptions despite an annual price tag of $350-450, not far from half the median annual income of an Indian. Sales for the twelve months to March 2017 reached $40.6m, and the firm says it expects to turn a profit in the current financial year. Prominent investors including Silicon Valley 9s Sequoia Capital and China 9s Tencent have put in a total of $200m, and Byju 9s has a punchy valuation of $800m. That is despite a patchy record for Indian edtech firms. Indian schools are price-sensitive and tend not to be early tech adopters, says Kartik Aneja of Nayi Disha, which makes educational digital games. Educomp, a maker of technology-enabled classroom products, used to sell expensive digital content and multimedia equipment to schools and was valued at over $1.4bn in 2008, but filed for bankruptcy last year. Byju 9s managed to bypass schools by selling directly to students and parents. Other challenges remain. The company has to send out physical memory cards to students who might not have sufficient internet bandwidth to download materials (a previous satellite-based method proved unreliable in bad weather). And a network of hundreds of agents is needed to collect cash from parents unused to paying digitally, adding to costs. Smartphones will spread, broadband will improve and online payments should become simpler. Less certain is whether parents will allow their kids to learn chiefly from screens. Little verifiable evidence exists that methods devised by Byju 9s succeed as well as customers hope. It would be an unusual child, though, that could be left unmoved by one bit of maths content advertised by the firm 4Shah Rukh Khan, a Bollywood star, guiding a troupe of dancers rhythmically laying out a proof for Pythagoras 9s theorem.

If successful, this regressive law (https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hr-620-could-put-disability-rights-at- risk)would significantly hinder a person with a disability's right to file a lawsuit for violations of access. It would require creating a written claim with specific legal requirements to document the violation (which would be onerous for an attorney, let alone your average John Q. Public with little experience with accessibility requirements and measurements). Businesses would then have 60 days to respond and an additional 120 days make \"substantial progress(https://www.defendingourfuture.org/hr-620-ada-education-and-reform- act/)\" -- a term still undefined. In practice, business owners could spend decades failing to comply with the accessibility requirements of the ADA as long as they claim to be attempting substantial progress. This attempt to undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities is happening largely in response to several stories claiming that there is a growing army of disabled people cruising the streets, looking for potential lawsuits wherever they go, and are getting rich off of the spoils. The reality, of course, is that the only thing that can be collected in ADA lawsuits are attorney's fees, so no disabled person who brings charges can actually get monetary damages from a lawsuit. All they can achieve is the business remedying its inaccessibility. !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley-family-1-large-169.jpg) !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley- family-1-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family 04:42 Furthermore, in cases where it's assumed that there are hundreds of lawyers repeatedly filing case after case to the point of appearing fraudulent, the Center for American Progress (where I am a senior fellow) has traced the number of attorneys doing so to only 12 lawyers, and there are disciplinary actions available to take action against them in state bar associations or district courts. A federal law -- especially one that would harm more than help -- is hardly necessary here. There is a significant countermovement against this legislation, comprised of a mix of social media (with groups like Crip the Vote and others using HandsOffMyADA), traditional civil disobedience by ADAPT(http://adapt.org/) and others, visits to legislators and phone banking by older disability organizations like the ARC and the Autism Society. These organizations are also working with groups like Little Lobbyists (https://www.littlelobbyists.org/)and other parent/family organizations who organized last year to protect Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. For those of us who are parents and working in the disability justice space, these alliances are proving to be interesting examples of not having to choose one group or the other. As someone who was 10 years old when the ADA became law, I have little memory of life before it, beyond what I've heard from my parents and elders in the community. The notion that I will need to start thinking about life without the ADA or with extremely limited access, paired with additional bureaucratic measures required to access public spaces, feels like I forgot to turn off Netflix before bed and an especially dark episode of \"Black Mirror\" is still playing in the background.

Almost half of students from the fifth grade cannot read texts meant for second-graders. Private tutors are called upon. Buses are plastered with ads for cramming institutes claiming to have coached exam ctoppers d, a status that rivals cricket superstardom. (A rival to Byju 9s is inevitably called Toppr.) According to one estimate, a quarter of all Indian students attend private coaching classes. Byju Raveendran should know. A few years ago, he used to attract 25,000 students to a particular stadium in Delhi, and fly to nine cities every week to teach high-school maths. Youngsters would learn shortcuts and tips to ace the fiendishly hard Common Admission Test for the best schools. Given the enormous size of the classrooms, it was impossible to make the sessions interactive, so Mr Raveendran came up with the idea of converting the lessons into video gobbets and hosting them online. The business has 900,000 paid users who spend over 50 minutes on the app each day 4metrics that media firms might envy. Around nine-tenths of customers of Byju 9s renew subscriptions despite an annual price tag of $350-450, not far from half the median annual income of an Indian. Sales for the twelve months to March 2017 reached $40.6m, and the firm says it expects to turn a profit in the current financial year. Prominent investors including Silicon Valley 9s Sequoia Capital and China 9s Tencent have put in a total of $200m, and Byju 9s has a punchy valuation of $800m. That is despite a patchy record for Indian edtech firms. Indian schools are price-sensitive and tend not to be early tech adopters, says Kartik Aneja of Nayi Disha, which makes educational digital games. Educomp, a maker of technology-enabled classroom products, used to sell expensive digital content and multimedia equipment to schools and was valued at over $1.4bn in 2008, but filed for bankruptcy last year. Byju 9s managed to bypass schools by selling directly to students and parents. Other challenges remain. The company has to send out physical memory cards to students who might not have sufficient internet bandwidth to download materials (a previous satellite-based method proved unreliable in bad weather). And a network of hundreds of agents is needed to collect cash from parents unused to paying digitally, adding to costs. Smartphones will spread, broadband will improve and online payments should become simpler. Less certain is whether parents will allow their kids to learn chiefly from screens. Little verifiable evidence exists that methods devised by Byju 9s succeed as well as customers hope. It would be an unusual child, though, that could be left unmoved by one bit of maths content advertised by the firm 4Shah Rukh Khan, a Bollywood star, guiding a troupe of dancers rhythmically laying out a proof for Pythagoras 9s theorem.

        "article": " New York 9s 1.1 million students have this week off, giving Richard A. Carranza(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/nyregion/carranza-new-york- schools-chancellor.html), as of Monday the chancellor of the city 9s public schools, a chance to ease into running the country 9s largest school system. , With 75,000 teachers and 1,800 schools, the job is a big leap for anyone. Mr. Carranza faces an additional set of challenges. He is new to New York and has never worked in the system, unlike his predecessor, Carmen Fari\\xf1a, who spent 52 years in the city 9s schools. His new boss, Bill de Blasio, is a second-term mayor with likely ambitions for higher office and a reputation as a micromanager. , At the news conference where his appointment was announced, Mr. Carranza declared that there was cno daylight between himself and the mayor, which makes it hard to know how much he will set a new course for the school system or push on issues, like segregation, that the administration has soft- pedaled. , Mr. Carranza comes to New York by way of Houston where he had a short stint as superintendent. Before that, he worked in San Francisco, Clark County, Nev., and Tucson, where he grew up. As he steps into his new position, here are some of the biggest issues he will face. , A 2014 report (https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration- and-diversity/ny-norflet-report-placeholder \"The report\")found that New York City has one of the most segregated school systems in the country. Nearly 70 percent of students are black and Latino, and they overwhelmingly go to school in racially isolated classrooms, with few white and Asian children. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Fari\\xf1a have repeatedly blamed the city 9s segregated neighborhoods and have suggested there is little they can do. Even after facing intense public pressure, they have taken only modest steps, such as setting aside seats in some schools for low-income students. When the mayor released what had been billed as a cbigger vision d(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/nyregion/mayor-bill-de- blasio-new-york-public-schools-diversity-plan.html \"Times coverage\") for integrating schools, he resisted even using the word csegregated. , A high-profile example of the problem is the lack of black and Latino students at the eight specialized high schools where admission is decided by a single test. This spring, only 10 percent of offers(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/nyregion/admissions-specialized- high-schools-new-york.html) at these schools went to black and Latino students. When Mr. de Blasio was running for mayor in 2013, he pledged to diversify these schools, but more recently he has suggested(https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/newsletters/politico-new- york-education/2018/03/12/de-blasio-on-specialized-high-school-diversity- crisis-043202) that his hands are tied and that any change must come from the state. , Mr. de Blasio came into office pledging to lift up low-performing schools, rather than close them, as his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had done. But his $582 million Renewal initiative, which flooded 94 schools with resources while subjecting them to sometimes contradictory directives, has produced disappointing results(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/nyregion /new-york-city-will-close-or-merge-19-schools-most-from-renewal-program.html). This year, the city proposed closing eight of the schools 4 the largest number it had ever closed in one year 4 drawing protests from parents and elected officials. , Mr. Carranza will have to decide whether to continue the initiative, whose future looks cloudy; the official who led the effort was recently moved aside, and no successor has been named. Fifty schools are expected to remain in the program next year. Another challenge: The city 9s Education Department has said that, to replace some of the schools it is closing, it will open eight new schools in the fall, something that this administration has little experience doing. , Though the city has made real progress on increasing overall graduation rates, the academic divides between different groups of students are yawning. Citywide, the graduation rate last year was 87.5 percent for Asian students and 83.2 percent for white students. For black students, the rate was 70 percent and for Hispanic students, 68.3 percent. Just 32.5 percent of students still learning English graduated. , Even within the same school, black and Hispanic students and those who live in poverty can fall behind their peers. A study(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/nyregion/study-black-white- achievement-gap-schools.html) from the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School looked at student performance for third through fifth graders on the 2016 state math exam, and it found the poorer the students, the lower their scores tended to be on the test, even if they attended school with wealthy children. , The issue is far from unique to New York. In San Francisco, Mr. Carranza faced a similar gap: African-American children there have long scored among the lowest in California on standardized tests. cIt 9s fair to say that like all the superintendents before him he was not able to find the magic formula, said Norman Yee, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco and a former president of the city 9s Board of Education. , In San Francisco, where Mr. Carranza spent his longest-tenure as a superintendent, he oversaw about 55,000 children. In New York, double that number 4 more than 111,500 students 4 were homeless at some point during the 2016-17 school year. That is 10 percent of the city 9s public school population. , Those homeless students include anyone in a temporary living situation, which could include children living in a car or a hotel or staying on the sofa at a friend 9s house. , In addition to the emotional toll, the academic effects of homelessness can be severe. Homeless students are chronically absent at far higher rates than other children, are more likely to drop out than their peers and less likely to graduate or to test on grade level. Even after finding housing, the Education Trust-New York found that formerly homeless children continue to struggle academically(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/homeless- students-school-new-york.html) for years. , Following through on a campaign promise, Mr. de Blasio in his first term created a public prekindergarten seat for every 4-year-old in the city. He is now planning to go further, creating thousands of seats for 3-year-olds in what he is calling c3-K. But while the prekindergarten initiative has been popular among parents, it has caused problems(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/nyregion/free-preschool-deblasio- new-york-city.html) for the previously existing system that provides free or subsidized child care and early education to low-income families. , Home-based child care providers have lost income and stand to lose more as 3-K is rolled out. So-called EarlyLearn centers, which serve infants to 5-year- olds 4 and, unlike prekindergarten classes in public schools, are open 10 hours a day and do not close for school vacations 4 are struggling to retain teachers, because teachers in public schools can make as much as $30,000 more per year. Many centers have had to close classrooms because they cannot find teachers to oversee them. , Directors of these programs have begged the city to address the salary disparity, which they say has drawn experienced teachers away from classrooms serving low-income children 4 who need those teachers the most 4 to classrooms serving higher-income children. ,  cThe narrative out of City Hall is that the signature initiative is early childhood education, and how that has helped low-income families, said David Nocenti, the executive director of Union Settlement, which serves roughly 350 children in centers in East Harlem. cThe reality is quite different. , About 200,000 New York City public school children are identified as having a disability, which can range from mild learning differences to severe challenges. , Spending on special education has increased under the de Blasio administration, while results for these students remain poor. The graduation rate among students with disabilities last year was just 46.7 percent, and the enormous system that serves them is riddled with problems. According to an annual report that the Education Department makes to the City Council, 48,000(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/nyregion/special-education-nyc- schools.html) students during the last school year received only some of the services they needed, or none at all. , Highlighting an additional area of vast shortcomings, the city 9s public advocate, Letitia James, found(https://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/sites/advocate.nyc.gov/files/denial_of_service_report_7717_1.pdf) that in the 2015-16 school year nearly half of the 9,000 issued vouchers, which allow students to receive services their schools cannot provide, went unused, in part because there were too few therapists in certain parts of the city. The Special Education Student Information System, the electronic platform that tracks student needs and services, is also riddled(https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/05/09/new-york-citys- special-ed-tracking-system-malfunctioned-more-than-800000-times-per-day-but- changes-are-underway/) with problems that, for example, lead it to provide incomplete information about whether students are receiving the services they need. , Mr. de Blasio ran for office criticizing charter schools and promising to halt the practice of giving them space in public school buildings, but he soon got a lesson(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/nyregion/cuomo-put-his-weight- behind-charter-school-protections.html) in the danger of going head-to-head with their wealthy supporters. In 2014, the year that Mr. de Blasio took office, a pro-charter group spent $9.6 million on lobbying(https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/nyregion/groups-that-back- bloombergs-education-agenda-enjoy-success-in-albany.html), more than any other organization in the state, much of it on advertisements attacking him. , Since then his administration has at times struggled to navigate its relationship with the city 9s 227 charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated and serve roughly 10 percent of the city 9s public school students. Perhaps the biggest challenge in the coming years will be finding space for new or expanding charter schools. Under legislation passed in 2014, the city must provide space for these schools or be responsible for at least part of their rent. But nearly every decision to place a charter school inside a school building is controversial, requiring other schools to squeeze into less space. , Ms. Fari\\xf1a has at times been disparaging of charters, and charter leaders are hoping that Mr. Carranza 9s arrival will be an opportunity for a reset. James Merriman, the chief executive officer of the New York City Charter School Center, said he hoped Mr. Carranza would embrace charter schools as partners. He suggested that Mr. Carranza could ask charter leaders to start schools specifically aimed at serving homeless students, for instance, or, with a change in state law, ask a high-performing charter to take over an elementary school zone and enroll all students in the zone rather than admit students through a lottery. ,  cIf he 9s willing to meet the sector at that level and see us as full partners, he 9ll find people on the other side, and together with philanthropy, we could do some interesting things, Mr. Merriman said.

'Brainwashing' process Kanat and other human rights advocates describe, citing sources on the ground, how people supposedly prone to influences of Islamic extremism undergo a \"brainwashing\" process inside the detention camps -- often housed in converted schools or government buildings. Detainees are required to praise the ruling Communist Party, sing revolutionary songs, learn to speak Mandarin, study the thought of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and confess perceived transgressions such as praying at a mosque or traveling abroad, according to activists. \"It's completely unlawful -- the authorities provide no legal documentation to the families and there are no time limits (on the length of detention),\" said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, which published a detailed report on the subject last September and called on Beijing to free all detainees. !Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180201130146-xinjiang-anti-terror- propaganda-posters-large-169.jpg) Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014. \"There's a lot of fear, with people losing contact with loved ones.\" Xinjiang authorities have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for information on the political education camps and response to activists' allegations, but state media outlets have covered these facilities and touted their effectiveness in de-radicalizing the locals. One newspaper article last April said that Uyghur residents \"eat and live alongside party cadres\" in one such camp that had \"already trained 2,008 people.\"(http://www.xinjiangyaou.com/xinjiang/002/1455513.shtml) Calling for a \"great wall of iron\" to safeguard the region's stability, President Xi has further expanded and strengthened China's vast security forces in Xinjiang.  Ubiquitous surveillance Activists say the regional government, now led by a hardline Xi loyalist, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs but also increasingly relied on high-tech tools to keep the population in check. They cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65. The authorities also enacted a sweeping anti-extremism law last year, with long beards, veils in public and home-schooling all on the ban list,(https://cnn.com/2017/03/31/asia/china-xinjiang-new-rules/index.html) prompting new denunciations from international human rights groups. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment as well as curtailed religious freedom in their homeland. Other critics have linked the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's repressive reign there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. !A Chinese paramilitary policeman watches as an ethnic Uyghur family walks in front of Urumqi&39;s Grand Bazaar, July, 2009.

Over the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, has also fueled ethnic tensions, despite the government's best effort to paint a picture of ethnic harmony. \"We guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnicities and prohibit the discrimination and oppression against any ethnic groups,\" Zhang Yijiong, a senior Communist Party official in charge ethnic minority affairs, told reporters last October. \"The cultures, histories, languages and traditions of all ethnicities are protected and respected by national laws.\" Critics of Beijing's Uyghur policy see a starkly different scenario in Xinjiang, as the authorities intensify their crackdown and forced political indoctrination spreads. \"These campaigns are purportedly about counter-extremism and counterterrorism, but ... it's really about surveillance, control and assimilation,\" said Wang, the Human Rights Watch researcher. \"The real intention of the Chinese government is to eliminate the Uyghurs as a distinct ethnic group,\" Rebiya Kadeer, a longtime exiled Uyghur leader who recently stepped down as president of the World Uyghur Congress, told CNN in an interview in Washington last year. \"Religious suppression, cultural restrictions, Uyghur language ban -- all this repression in Xinjiang only makes the Uyghurs hold on to their identity more firmly,\" she added. \"China has awakened the Uyghur people.\"  ",

        "article": " Facial recognition technology is improving by leaps and bounds. Some commercial software can now tell the gender of a person in a photograph. , When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time. , But the darker the skin, the more errors arise 4 up to nearly 35 percent for images of darker skinned women, according to a new study that breaks fresh ground by measuring how the technology works on people of different races and gender. , These disparate results, calculated by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, show how some of the biases in the real world can seep into artificial intelligence, the computer systems that inform facial recognition. , In modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women. , One widely used facial-recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white, according to another research study. , The new study also raises broader questions of fairness and accountability in artificial intelligence at a time when investment in and adoption of the technology is racing ahead. , Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending. , Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults(https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement 4 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases. , Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far. ,  cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail 4 to make them socially accountable, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah. , Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, Google had to apologize(https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/google- photos-mistakenly-labels-black-people-gorillas/) after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as cgorillas. , Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini 9s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations. ,  cBut this is the first work I 9m aware of that shows that empirically, Ms. Friedler said. , Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long. , But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face. , By then, face recognition software was increasingly moving out of the lab and into the mainstream. ,  cO.K., this is serious, she recalled deciding then. cTime to do something. , So she turned her attention to fighting the bias built into digital technology. Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of calgorithmic accountability, which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair. , Her short TED Talk(https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms) on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the Algorithmic Justice League(https://www.ajlunited.org/), a project to raise awareness of the issue. , In her newly published paper(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf), which will be presented at a conference(https://fatconference.org/) this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems 4 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China 4 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software 4 and their code was publicly available for testing. , She found them all wanting. , To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark- skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents. , The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race. , Then, each company 9s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft 9s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM 9s and Megvii 9s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males. , Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was cdeeply committed to cunbiased and ctransparent services. This month, the company said, it will roll out an improved service with a nearly 10-fold increase in accuracy on darker-skinned women. , Microsoft said that it had calready taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology and that it was investing in research cto recognize, understand and remove bias. , Ms. Buolamwini 9s co-author on her paper is Timnit Gebru, who described her role as an adviser. Ms. Gebru is a scientist at Microsoft Research, working on its Fairness Accountability Transparency and Ethics in A.I. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/fate/)group. , Megvii, whose Face++ software is widely used for identification in online payment and ride-sharing services in China, did not reply to several requests for comment, Ms. Buolamwini said. , Ms. Buolamwini is releasing her data set for others to build upon. She describes her research as ca starting point, very much a first step toward solutions. , Ms. Buolamwini is taking further steps in the technical community and beyond. She is working with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(https://www.ieee.org/index.html), a large professional organization in computing, to set up a group to create standards for accountability and transparency in facial analysis software. , She meets regularly with other academics, public policy groups and philanthropies that are concerned about the impact of artificial intelligence. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation(https://www.fordfoundation.org/), said that the new technology could be a cplatform for opportunity, but that it would not happen if it replicated and amplified bias and discrimination of the past. ,  cThere is a battle going on for fairness, inclusion and justice in the digital world, Mr. Walker said. , Part of the challenge, scientists say, is that there is so little diversity within the A.I. community.  ,  cWe 9d have a lot more introspection and accountability in the field of A.I. if we had more people like Joy, said Cathy O 9Neil, a data scientist and author of cWeapons of Math Destruction. , Technology, Ms. Buolamwini said, should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it 9s used on. ,  cYou can 9t have ethical A.I. that 9s not inclusive, she said. cAnd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards.

Gen. Joe Logan announced during a news conference Tuesday. The employee who sent the alert has been fired and another is in the process of being suspended without pay.\\xa0 Logan, the agency's director, said Miyagi submitted his resignation Tuesday morning and he accepted it. Logan also said the \"button pusher\" has been terminated. The employee who sent the alert -- creating a panic across the state(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-false-missile-alert-how-one-family- reacted/) \\-- thought an actual attack was imminent, the Federal Communications Commission said earlier Tuesday. Hawaii has been testing alert capabilities, and the employee for the state Emergency Management Agency mistook a drill for a real warning about a missile threat. He responded by sending the alert without sign-off from a supervisor at a time when there are fears over the threat of nuclear-tipped missiles from North Korea.\\xa0 !hawaii.jpg (https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/01/30/56dbe4e9 -1a0b- 4c70-9625-74b0d158c066/crop/339x350+140+0/resize/220x/3345c67ed85c635d061bea56b43cede8/hawaii.jpg) Vern Miyagi has resigned as administrator for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.  Hawai\\u02bbi Emergency Management Agency \"There were no procedures in place to prevent a single person from mistakenly sending a missile alert\" in Hawaii, said James Wiley, a cybersecurity and communications reliability staffer at the FCC. There was no requirement to double-check with a colleague or get a supervisor's approval, he said.\\xa0 In addition, software at Hawaii's emergency agency used the same prompts for both test and actual alerts, and it generally used prepared text that made it easy for a staffer to click through the alerting process without focusing enough on the text of the warning that would be sent.\\xa0 The worker, whose name has not been released, has refused to talk to the FCC, but federal regulators got information from his written statement that state officials provided.\\xa0 The alert was sent to cellphones, TV and radio stations in Hawaii on the morning of Jan. 13, leading people to fear the state was under nuclear attack. \"THIS IS NOT A DRILL,\" it said. For what felt like an eternity, islanders heard an audible warning: \"A missile may impact on land or sea within minutes. This is not a drill.\"  * Hawaii gov. says message about false alert delayed because he didn't know login info(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-false-missile-alert-message-delayed-because-he-didnt-know-login-info/)  Amanda Thompson screamed when she read the alert. She and her husband threw water and supplies into a tiny closet under the stairs and huddled with their infant and 2-year-old, believing they were about to die.\\xa0 \"We grabbed everything we possibly could -- blankets, pillows, diapers, wipes, food, water bottles -- as I'm crying my eyes out,\" Thompson said. \"We called his parents, and I'm crying so hard that they can't understand me.\" It took 38 minutes for officials to send an alert retracting the warning because Hawaii did not have a standardized system for sending such corrections, the FCC said.\\xa0    The federal agency, which regulates the nation's airwaves and sets standards for such emergency alerts, criticized the state's delay in correcting it.\\xa0 The head of the FCC has called the error \"absolutely unacceptable(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-false-ballistic-missile- alert-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-investigation/).\" Earlier this month,\\xa0Miyagi gave CBS News correspondent David Begnaud a tour(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-hawaiis-emergency-alert-command- center/) of Hawaii's Emergency Alert Command Center and discussed what went wrong. During their conversation, Miyagi explained cellphone users weren't told about the error sooner because his agency didn't have procedures for issuing corrections. That has since changed 4 and two people will now be required to send out alerts in the future.\\xa0 The FCC said the state Emergency Management Agency has already taken steps to try to avoid a repeat of the false alert, requiring more supervision of drills and alert and test-alert transmissions. It has created a correction template for false alerts and has stopped ballistic missile defense drills until its own investigation is done. According to the FCC inquiry, the recorded message used for the drill began by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" -- the script for a drill, the FCC said. Then the recording used language that is typically used for a real threat, not a drill: \"this is not a drill.\" The recording ended by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise.\" However, the worker on duty did not hear the \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" part of the message and believed the threat was real, according to the employee's statement. The worker responded by sending the alert.   ",

        "article": " My first step was, like most people, to Google it. This led me to the W3Schools(https://www.w3schools.com/) tutorials, a handy site where you can learn to program. To build a website I needed a computer, but no one in my family could afford one. Luckily, my relative gave me a Nokia 2690 phone. It wasn't very advanced, but adequate enough for me to learn the language of programming.  The new Zuckerberg? !Nokia 2690 phone.(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Nokia 2690 phone.(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180104171441-nokia-2690 -phone-large-169.jpg) Nokia 2690 phone. Once I had become a capable programmer, the idea for my first web project was sparked after I watched The Social Network movie, which about the founding of Facebook. I was inspired by Mark Zuckerberg. But I wanted to go further and create something better. At that time Facebook was set up to connect people you already knew, but I wanted to create a platform which connected everybody. After some time and a lot of effort, my attempt to replace Facebook fell through. I couldn't get enough users to sign up on the website. The few that signed up didn't stick around because there was only a few people to chat with.  A new idea, a new app !The dot Learn team.

I quickly moved onto my next idea: an app that makes it easy to send text messages to multiple people at once and at an affordable price. The cost of sending text messages in Nigeria was around $0.013, I planned on reducing it to $0.005. To build the app, I learned a new programming language called Java. I also needed to have a computer to compile the code, but I still couldn't afford one. Fortunately, I was able to find a way to build an app right on my Nokia phone, through an application called J2ME SDK Mobile(http://elvischidera.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/create-j2me-apps-with-your- mobile-phone.html). I spent days programming, carefully typing everything on the phone's small number pad. After a few months, I had built the website and the app. !Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171207115153-kenya-cyrptocurrency- miner-restricted-large-169.jpg)(/2017/12/18/africa/inside-life- cryptocurrency-miner-kenya-africa/index.html) Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner(/2017/12/18/africa/inside- life-cryptocurrency-miner-kenya-africa/index.html) The app launch went well\\u200a -- \\u200aat least better than my first project. We got some local press and grew to about 5,000 users. There were a few daily transactions, but over time, due in part to my inexperience (I was still only 14 years old), I was not able to keep up with the number of users and had to shut the app down. It was becoming clear that to take my programming skills to the next level I would need a computer. I cut my daily expenses and lived a simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop. Still, it wasn't enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job building a website to earn the remaining sum. How do you build a website for PC on a feature phone? Simple: have a Facebook friend you disturb every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback. It was cheaper than going to a cyber cafe.  Making apps !Welcome, to the bleeding-edge of African innovation: VR, 3D printing, AI and the rest.

I switched immediately to creating Android apps. The Android platform didn't have the limitations that exist on the J2ME platform which, for a techie like me, was very exciting. At this point, I was now a high school graduate, and I was looking for freelance jobs to support my family. I saw a job advert for an Android developer position at dot Learn. I looked them up and realized it was set up by two MIT-based technologists working in a field that I was passionate about, education technology. !African &39;smart cities:&39; the future of the continent?(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!African &39;smart cities:&39; the future of the continent?(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130318100618-hope-city-1-story- top.jpg)(/2017/12/12/africa/africa-new-smart-cities/index.html) African 'smart cities:' the future of the continent?(/2017/12/12/africa /africa-new-smart-cities/index.html) They had a unique idea: to solve the problem of access to online education by making educational videos extremely data-light\\u200a -- \\u200aas low as 1MB for every hour of video. I felt this was key to making education more accessible, as cheap and fast internet connection needed to download large videos is still uncommon in Africa. I am very passionate about revolutionizing education in Africa. In fact, I had already built a free (ad-supported) exam prep app called PrepUp(http://techcabal.com/2015/12/18/this-app-makes-exam-prep-sessions- look-like-a-day-in-the-game-truck/) with over 30,000+ installs and was one of the finalists at the West Africa Mobile Awards 2016(https://techpoint.ng/2016/03/24/west-africa-mobile- awards-2016-finalists/). !This West African lab made a 3D printer from toxic e-waste(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!This West African lab made a 3D printer from toxic e-waste(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171101142626-3d-printer- togo-04-large-169.jpg)(/2017/11/28/africa/3d-printer-electronic- waste/index.html) This West African lab made a 3D printer from toxic e-waste(/2017/11/28/africa/3d-printer-electronic-waste/index.html) After several days of debating with myself, I finally applied for the position. Well, long story short: after lots of preparation, a phone interview, coding projects, and answering challenging questions, I was accepted. Working at dot Learn, I have met lots of awesome people from MIT, Harvard, and other great places. As a team, we have been part of some testing competitions like the Techcrunch Battlefield Africa(https://techcrunch.com/video/dot- learn-startup-battlefield-africa-2017/59df0c729e45105de569e2c1/), Cisco Innovation Challenge(https://blogs.cisco.com/news/the-price-of-knowledge-dot- learn), and the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge(https://www.mitinclusiveinnovation.com/finalists). It's been incredible so far, and dot Learn is just one of many startups, like Andela and iROKO, in the growing tech ecosystem bursting in Lagos.

        "article": " AUTOMATION and globalisation have brought drastic changes to Western labour markets. Middle-skilled jobs are disappearing fast. In America, wages for blue-collar workers have been largely stagnant since the 1970s, whereas those for university graduates have soared. Silicon Valley types frequently warn that advances in technology, especially in artificial intelligence, will be devastating for low-skilled workers. One prominent study, by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University, estimated that 47% of jobs in America could be automated over the next two decades. The spectre of mass unemployment, along with increasing levels of income equality, has led many policymakers to see investment in university as crucial for economic prosperity. Governments have plenty of reason to be bullish about higher education. Perhaps the best piece of evidence they have of the wisdom of investing more in universities is the graduate-wage premium 4the difference in wages between those with university degrees and those without. In their book cThe Race between Education and Technology d, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz of Harvard University point out that this premium fell during the first half of the 20th century in America as universities expanded enrolment, but started rising sharply around 1980. Although the premium has started to level off in recent years, the fact that university graduates still make around 70% more than non-graduates suggests that demand for skilled workers still far exceeds supply.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

While universities are places of learning, they are also social sorting mechanisms. Part of the reason why university graduates earn more is because they are brighter and harder-working to begin with. Some professionals, such as doctors or engineers, do require an extensive amount of technical training, but many do not. The fact that humanities graduates, whose courses often have little to do with their subsequent work, tend to earn more if they come from more prestigious institutions suggests that one reason for going to university is to get ahead of peers in the job market. Bryan Caplan, an economist at George Mason University, argues that earning a degree is like cstanding up at a concert d. Doing so improves your view of the show, but it comes at a cost to those sitting behind you. Across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, 43% of adults aged 25-34 now have tertiary degrees, up from 23% in 1995. Yet it is not clear to what extent these degrees have translated into economic gains. An analysis by _The Economist_ of American labour-market data finds that since 1970 the share of workers with degrees has increased in virtually every occupation. But in around half of occupations with better-educated workers average wages have still fallen in real terms. The ubiquity of the degree means that for many workers going to university is more of an obligation than a choice. Moreover, university does not suit all learners. Estimates of the economic returns to higher education tend to assume that all students will graduate. In practice, around 30% of students in Europe and 40% of students in America will drop out before earning their degrees. This means that the expected economic returns of a university education for average students are far lower than commonly understood. Governments are right to fret about training future workers, but they should look beyond just universities.  ",

Some told stories of discussing long- hidden shame, others shared experiences of trauma using descriptions that were remarkably similar. Still others, like 83-year-old Geraldine Wallace, wrote in saying that she told her granddaughter that cI 9m glad your generation isn 9t putting up with this. , This week, after an anonymous allegation against Aziz Ansari was made public in an online magazine called Babe(https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz- ansari-28355), those conversations seemed to take on a different tone. Women of all ages debated what the article, which recounted a date between a 23 -year-old woman known as cGrace and the actor in 2017, actually depicted. Was it, in Grace 9s words, a case of sexual assault 4 or was it merely a really bad date? The opinions seemed to fall starkly along generational lines. , Caitlin Flanagan, a critic in her 50s writing for The Atlantic(https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the- humiliation-of-aziz-ansari/550541/), argued that the article was, in effect, c3,000 words of revenge porn 4 a case in which a woman who did not clearly say no stayed in a situation in which she was uncomfortable. ( cApparently there is a whole country full of young women who don 9t know how to call a cab, she wrote.) , Meanwhile, a 33-year-old staff editor and writer, Bari Weiss, wrote in The Times Opinion(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe- sexual-harassment.html?_r=0) section that Mr. Ansari was guilty of only one thing: Not being a mind reader. , In Vox(https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace- babe-me-too), Jezebel(https://jezebel.com/babe-what-are-you- doing-1822114753) and The Guardian(https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/16/aziz-ansari- story-missed-opportunity), women in their 20s and 30s noted that while they considered the Babe piece to be poorly reported, it had sparked an important and necessary conversation about the complicated dynamics of sexual consent. , We gathered Ms. Weiss and two other Times staffers 4 ages 29 and 59 4 to talk sexual consent, metoo and the seeming generational divide. , **JESSICA BENNETT: This particular story has left me grappling with a particular question. Is it possible for something to be nonconsensual but** **also** **not sexual assault?** , **BARI WEISS, STAFF EDITOR AND WRITER, OPINION, 33** : One of the most remarkable aspects of this truly remarkable moment is that we are collectively and openly reassessing what we regard as kosher when sex and power is involved. But one of the more distressing and underreported aspects of this re-moralization is that some younger feminists are telling older feminists that they don 9t understand their own lives. They are telling women who experienced what they considered cbad dates or cbad sex that those experiences were, in fact, assault. Or worse. , Many older feminists I know are sitting there saying cHow dare you look at me 4 me who has kicked open the door of every room you occupy, who had to beg for the paid maternity leave you now enjoy, who endured the alienation of being the only woman at the table so that now you get to sit at its head 4 and tell me I 9m not self-aware enough to understand my own life? , **FAHIMA HAQUE, SOCIAL STRATEGY EDITOR, 29** : I probably sound salty but it doesn 9t surprise me that women, generationally, are differing on the MeToo movement. I am a younger feminist, but I 9m not an unthinking one who assumes I have no agency. I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I 9ve grappled with, nearly every day of my life, what needs to happen for men to be better and for women to feel strong enough to use their voice clearly to hold men accountable. So I fully admit that I 9m pretty militant about male behavior. , **SUSAN CHIRA, SENIOR GENDER CORRESPONDENT, 59** : I share my generation 9s general unease with labeling sexual awkwardness sexual assault. It 9s not only about refusing to see yourself as a victim, but also it 9s a fundamental act of fairness. I also think all generations are confronting that sex is an area of great uncertainty, vulnerability and, at times, abuse of power. Just because it 9s common to emerge from bad sexual encounters feeling bruised doesn 9t mean we shouldn 9t question why it 9s so common and what needs to change. , **There seems to be one thing some younger women have insisted on: That Aziz did abuse his power in the situation, even if it wasn 9t professional power. What do you think?** , **BW:** Refusing to give a factory worker a promotion unless she blows you? That is an abuse of power. Going on a date and hooking up 4 however boorishly 4 with another person? That is simply not an abuse of power. If we are going to weigh every relationship on the scales of power, well, then investment bankers won 9t be allowed to date baristas. We need to draw a bright line between what happens in the workplace and what happens in the privacy of our apartments (or kitchens). Right now they are getting conflated. , **SC:** I think it 9s crucial to make distinctions, and Aziz 9s accuser fell far short because she didn 9t. Yes, he was more powerful than she was 4 not only as a man who often takes the role of aggressor in sex, but also because of his celebrity. But he held no institutional power over her career or advancement. And yet if he behaved boorishly or insensitively, if he failed to pick up cues she may have been too embarrassed to verbalize, he, like other men who 9ve behaved this way, should be reflecting on why this encounter went so awry. , **Bari, you wrote this week that the only thing Aziz is guilty of is not being a mind reader. That 9s true, but Grace also describes expressing her discomfort in multiple places. Shouldn 9t we have a higher bar for men 9s emotional intelligence?** , **BW:** Absolutely. But that is not going to happen overnight. And until that blessed day of universal male emotional intelligence is upon us 4 or when someone figures out how to clone Jeff Goldblum 4 I want fewer women to be harassed, assaulted and raped. In part that means telling women to use their common sense. , **FH:** Aziz Ansari did write a (very good) book on modern romance, but this just highlights that even the most sensitive, thoughtful 4 dare I say 8woke 9 4 kind of man also has a lot to learn. We need to have a higher bar. , **Daphne Merkin, a critic and novelist, recentlymade the point(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/opinion/golden-globes-metoo.html) in our Opinion section that we are treating women like frail Victorian-era housewives. I heard similar from a middle-aged friend, who wondered why Grace didn 9t cjust get up and leave. Thoughts?** , **FH:** The cget up and leave theory is, in theory, a good one. But that just feels ugly and callous in practice. It paints some women as strong warriors and others as weak fools. I will always respect first- and second- wave feminists for taking those crucial first steps for women 9s rights, but to shun the new wave of women because their approach is different is divisive. We won 9t move forward. I get that Grace 9s actions are grating, because ideally she would have felt confident enough in herself to leave. But I remember that at 23 it can be daunting to be the one who says no. , **SC:** Not sure this cuts generationally, though it may. That is, there are so many reasons women may be constrained from saying explicitly when they 9re uncomfortable, or they end up staying what turns out in hindsight to have been too long. Yes, it 9s important to learn to say no firmly. But we all know men don 9t always listen to that. And we also know that women themselves are often conflicted. Sex is always going to be messy and fumbling, to some degree. And I personally think we have to be tolerant of some uncertainty, some grayness. But if MeToo is going to spur real changes, men have to curb their sense of entitlement. , **Here 9s a question we get often from readers: What about due process? Is it really fair to place Aziz Ansari 9s name on the same spectrum as Harvey Weinstein?** , **BW:** Our current situation 4 guilty because accused, as Margaret Atwood put it(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/am-i-a-bad- feminist/article37591823/) 4 is absolutely terrifying to me. And it should be to anyone that cares about justice and due process. , **FH:** The MeToo movement is the best part of social media. And trial by Twitter is the worst part of social media. But, most people aren 9t on Twitter exhaustively the way media folks are, so frankly while it 9s troubling that some bring out their 280-count pitchforks, I 9m just not too concerned that it 9s going to sideline the overall power and scope of such newfound, increased transparency. , **SC:** What 9s extraordinary 4 and deeply unsettling 4 is that MeToo gives women power that men have had for so long. Men could ruin reputations, undermine or destroy women 9s careers, act impulsively. I hope and believe that women can wield power more responsibly and more justly. , _This interview has been edited and condensed._ , _**Make a friend 9s day: Forward this email.**_ , _Get this from a friend?Sign up here(https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters /gender-issues). _ , _You can also read uson the web(https://www.nytimes.com/series/metoo-moment) or listen to us on WNYC 9s The Takeaway(https://www.wnyc.org/series /metoo-memos-understanding-cultural-moment). _ , _Share your feedback atnytgender@nytimes.com(mailto:nytgender@nytimes.com)._  ",

Where do morals come from? What is the difference between Jesus in the Bible and in other scriptures? These are just some of the questions the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) says that secondary school pupils grapple with on a regular basis. But the REC is warning that a shortage of religious education teachers could contribute to religious stereotyping and discrimination, leaving pupils at risk of becoming ignorant, or bigoted. It says high quality specialist teaching about all faiths, beliefs and world views is essential in a diverse society and is launching a campaign to try to attract more teachers into the profession. Government data shows that in 2017-18, only 405 of initial teacher training places in England for RE were filled - well below the target of 643; figures for Wales have not yet been published.    The figures come against a backdrop of schools struggling to retain existing teachers(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42873153) \\- last month a report found the number of qualified teachers leaving the profession (for reasons other than retirement) had increased from 6% (25,260) of the qualified workforce in 2011 to 8% (34,910) in 2016.  'The big mysteries of life' For Lynsey Wilkinson, head of religious education at Redhill Academy in Arnold near Nottingham, RE is important, given the range of views and opinions to which pupils are exposed. \"We live in a dynamic ever-changing society full of different perspectives, beliefs and cultures,\" says Miss Wilkinson. \"Learning about these things helps the pupils in my classroom see the world clearly and helps them develop a genuine understanding about the world and the people in it. \"And that understanding will help them to shape the society of the future - a better society.\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Miss Wilkinson says that while she does not have a religious faith herself, it's exhilarating to debate big questions of life with pupils. \"I don't consider myself religious, but there's an academic side to RE that's fascinating to me - the idea of approaching these huge concepts from an intellectual point of view is one I've developed a real passion for. \"I spend my day helping these tirelessly curious kids get to grips with the big mysteries of life, examining spiritual beliefs, walking them through abstract philosophical concepts and getting into spirited debates over morals and ethics.\"  'At risk of ignorance' Rudolf Eliott Lockhart, chief executive of the REC, says specialist teachers are crucial for keeping young people properly informed. \"Without good quality religious education delivered by a qualified RE teacher, who provides accurate and balanced information about the array of different world views that make up modern Britain, young people are placed at risk. \"Not only are they at risk of ignorance that might lead to misunderstanding or even bigotry, but as they go through life, they risk basing their knowledge, understanding and opinions on sources that perpetuate inaccurate and misleading stereotypes. If and when those prejudices and falsehoods surface in the classroom, well trained teachers of RE are equipped to challenge and correct them. \"With information and opinion so freely available on social media and other online sources, pupils need to be taught to differentiate between sources that are reliable and reputable and those that are more likely to lead to religious discrimination and hatred. \"It is clear that in Britain today, we need to develop a better understanding of different faiths and beliefs so that we build more cohesive communities. In a world where religious literacy is now a vital skill in all walks of life, the shortage of qualified RE teachers is a deep concern and needs to be urgently addressed.\"  What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Religious education remains compulsory at each key stage for all state-funded schools, including academies and free schools, and we expect all schools to fulfil their statutory duties. \"In addition, we have changed the law and the requirements in schools so that they have to actively promote mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.\" A spokesman for the Welsh government said: \"We are currently reforming the way in which initial teacher education is delivered - putting in place new accreditation criteria and strengthening the ways in which schools and universities work together. \"An advisory board has also been established to consider issues of teacher recruitment and retention. \"We believe that this, together with a new curriculum, a new approach to our foundation phase and a commitment to professional learning will help us attract the very best teachers.\"   ",

In his first public speech since taking up the post, Mr Hinds said schools needed a mix of traditional academic subjects and a sense of \"resilience\" and skills such as public speaking. Mr Hinds said that a high proportion of new jobs would require digital skills. He also called for improvements in vocational training for adults. The education secretary said young people needed the skills to be able to \"write apps\" as well as being able to use them.    He said lessons in computing were needed to prepare young people for industries being changed by artificial intelligence and the arrival of technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Speaking at the Education World Forum in London, Mr Hinds emphasised the need for both \"core academic subjects\" and other, \"soft skills\" that could make young people more employable.  'Sports and voluntary work' But in his first presentation since becoming education secretary in the recent ministerial reshuffle, he gave few clues about any significant change in direction. Instead, Mr Hinds focused on how schools needed to prepare people for a shifting jobs market - and the importance of skills in communication and developing character. \"I would suggest that there is nothing soft about these skills,\" he told this international education gathering. \"The hard reality of soft skills is, actually, these things around the workplace, and these things around character and resilience are important for anybody to achieve in life, as well as for the success of our economy,\" said Mr Hinds. He stressed the importance of the \"ethos of a school, the expectations set for students\" and activities such as \"sport, public speaking and voluntary work\". Mr Hinds said these would shape the \"character, resilience and workplace skills that our young people take with them\". The new education secretary also pointed to the importance of helping adults to retrain for a changing jobs market. The conference heard that the UK's economy could receive a huge financial boost if there were improvements in the levels of basic skills. Andreas Schleicher, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) director of education, said that a fifth of 15-year-olds in the UK struggled to achieve even the most basic levels in maths and reading. \"If the United Kingdom were to ensure that all students had at least basic skills, the economic gains could reach $3.6 trillion (\\xa32.58trn) in additional income for the economy over the working life of these students,\" he told the conference. On the basis of standards rising in other countries, Mr Schleicher said: \"Such improvements in educational performance are entirely realistic.\"   ",

(AP Photo/Press Trust of India, File) NEW DELHI 4\\xa0It 9s only the fourth day of annual examinations in India 9s largest state of Uttar Pradesh and already the government says 661,643 students\\xa0 4 around 10 percent of the total number enrolled\\xa0 4 have failed to show up. A government official said it 9s because this year they've upped their anti-cheating efforts, and clamped down on the state 9s notorious education mafia by installing CCTV cameras and deploying a police task force to catch the cheaters. India 9s hugely competitive examination system coupled with poor teaching\\xa0standards in schools has seen the growth of a massive cheating industry in recent decades. Students need top marks\\xa0 4 sometimes over 99 percent 4 to get into the country 9s highly oversubscribed universities and so examiners are bribed, answer sheets leaked and exam rooms infiltrated. No more,\\xa0said Neena Srivastava, secretary of the Uttar Pradesh board of education, who described the ccheating mafia as part of organized crime. cWe are fighting against this evil. We have to cleanse the state of this menace. To\\xa0curb cheating, Uttar Pradesh 9s education minister, Dinesh Sharma told(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/crackdown-on- education-mafia-will-enhance-up-boards-brand-value-dy-cm-dinesh- sharma/articleshow/62841391.cms) Times of India that the government 9s new measures this year included clamping down on suspicious exam centers and firing lax district inspectors. Top scorers would have their exam sheets published, he said, so everyone could see how they performed. cIn the cheating racket, genuine students are worst sufferers, he said. Without the option of cheating, thousands of\\xa0students are simply not showing up.\\xa0Others are taking their chances. In one school, a teacher was caught dictating answers to students, despite CCTV cameras being turned on, according to Scroll(https://scroll.in/latest/867936/over-1-8-lakh-students- absent-on-the-first-day-of-the-uttar-pradesh-board-examinations). In another, Times of India(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/five- arrested-for-abetting-cheating/articleshow/62814191.cms?) reported,\\xa0five people including a school principal\\xa0were arrested for facilitating mass cheating. India 9s rapid development has seen a huge demand for college graduates in the past\\xa0three decades. Aspiring young Indians hope to rise above their parents 9 status and take a portion of the growing pie of wealth in cities. But getting into those colleges requires top scores in state-level exams. So crucial are school exams to ordinary Indian families, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi even penned a new book released this month called cExam Warriors giving young Indians top tips for exam success. Among them are doing yoga, using acronyms as a learning device, and laughing as you enter and leave the exam hall. But even Modi 9s exam mantras can 9t surmount the chronic problems of India 9s education system. Schools are often understaffed, teachers absent, and curricula is focused on rote learning. In villages, schools sometimes don 9t have electricity or the right textbooks. A\\xa0lack of toilets and running water, especially for menstruating girls, leads to high dropout rates. Srivastava and others, intent on cleaning up the exam system, said the tough new anti-cheating measures will deter future cheaters. cChildren should study. Teachers should give better and timely education. Children should not be enticed into these nefarious activities. Exams will end March 12.  ",

        "article": " WILLIAM HITE, Philadelphia 9s school superintendent, has a difficult job. His school district, which contains some of the poorest pupils\\xa0in the nation, has been under state control since 2001, an arrangement that will end this year. Proficiency in reading and maths lags about 30 percentage points behind the rest of the state. To boost results the district has turned to proliferating charter schools, which receive public funds but have independent management and now educate one in three children in the district. Twenty-one low-performing public schools, christened cRenaissance schools d, have been turned over to charter operators. At a school-board meeting on February 15th vocal charter supporters, mostly black parents frustrated with poor local schools, confronted angry, mostly white, teachers.  cI can 9t and I won 9t let my sons down, testified Rasheeda Fossey, whose children are in the school system. After a lawyer for charter schools finished speaking, teachers booed and hissed cBullshit d. Mr Hite, trapped in the middle of the squabble, says his role is cto ensure high-quality schools and cnot ask what kind of school it is d. \\xa0Charters are chafing under the district 9s supervision, which they see as biased, while the teachers 9 union operates in a state of war. The expansion of charter schools represents ca concerted effort to dismantle public education as we know it d, says Jerry Jordan, the president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

That is despite the appointment of Betsy DeVos, a longtime funder of school-choice efforts, as secretary of education. The federal government pays for less than 10% of public-school funds. Control is devolved to states and school districts, leaving the education secretary rather weak in setting policy. At a recent breakfast put on by school-choice advocates on Capitol Hill for Republican congressional staffers, Ms DeVos was not mentioned once. She may have had more influence as a deep-pocketed donor, who helped the rapid expansion in charter schools in Michigan, than as education secretary. States, especially those governed by Republicans, are expanding schemes such as vouchers and education savings accounts, where the state transfers cash directly to parents. Spending on such programmes, which now include 470,000 children, has tripled as a share of education expenses in the past ten years, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group.\\xa0Charter schools now educate 3.1m pupils, a sevenfold increase since 2000. In New Orleans, which rebuilt its woeful education system after Hurricane Katrina, 93% of pupils are now educated in charters, where they have made considerable improvement. Other urban school districts are not as far along as New Orleans, but many are emulating it. Cities like Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Washington, where 46% of pupils are enrolled in charters, are examples of a growing cportfolio model movement. Under this approach, school districts treat their charter and traditional public-school offerings much as stock-pickers do their financial portfolios, by strenuously monitoring performance and quickly ridding themselves of low-performing assets. Rather than creating unfettered markets, where the ready availability of public cash can attract unscrupulous providers, technocrats wield a heavy cudgel 4the threat of closure 4to force accountability. The financial analogy of cportfolio model d, and its association with Michael Bloomberg when he was mayor of New York City, has made the term pejorative among those who talk of education being privatised. But the portfolio model is actually less like a pure market in education, because it takes choices away from parents, many of whom are attached to their local school, no matter how mediocre. Paul Hill, the intellectual progenitor of the portfolio model, reckons that 40 school districts, most of them large and urban, have now adopted this method. Even with their impressive growth, charters educate only 7% of American pupils. The grand experiment can be justified on two grounds. The first is moral 4there is inherent good in being able to pick schools. cParents 9 right to choice is really the civil-rights issue of the 21st century, says John Schilling, president of the American Federation for Children, which Ms DeVos once chaired and helped found. cLow-income parents should also have the ability to send their kids where they want, he adds. The second justification for choice is pragmatic 4to spur competition and innovation which would cdrag education out of the 19th century d, as Milton Friedman put it. For this crowd, outcomes are important. But, like the traditional public schools they seek to replace, charter schools tend to produce uneven results. The best nationwide study, by researchers at Stanford University, suggests they have little overall effect on learning. Detroit 9s charters, which Ms DeVos pushed mightily, are widely seen as a mess. Students in Philadelphia 9s charters do better in reading exams, but not in maths. The evidence on school vouchers is similarly uninspiring, with little gain in test scores and only marginal increases in graduation rates. Pupils who took part in Indiana and Louisiana 9s voucher schemes posted significantly worse results than those who remained in the public-school system. Treating schools like a portfolio, where bad ones are quickly pushed out of business, might work a bit better.

          "article": " BORDEAUX, France 4 Bordeaux, the region, is unrivaled historically as the greatest, most prodigious producer of fine wine in the world. , Bordeaux, the port city on the Garonne river, has played a crucial role as the center of the wine trade. Historically, though, it has lacked charm and lovability, and paradoxically, beyond its commercial ties, Bordeaux has had little connection with the wine producers in the growing regions that define the region and practically surround the city. , But an ambitious wine museum that opened in the city of Bordeaux on the west bank of the river in 2016 is working to change that. While capturing the worldwide culture of wine in a modern, immersive, multimedia style, La Cit\\xe9 du Vin(http://www.laciteduvin.com/en) hopes to serve as a critical link between the urban center of the wine trade and the myriad producers who have historically stood apart. , Simply as a cultural center, the City of Wine succeeds brilliantly in many ways. As a symbol, the curvaceous, contemporary building designed by XTU(https://www.designboom.com/tag/xtu-architects/), a Parisian architecture firm, swirls up from the riverside not unlike the Guggenheim Museum flowing upward on staid Fifth Avenue. As a statement, it says that hidebound, conservative Bordeaux is no more. , Situated between the districts of Chartrons, the historic center of the wine trade, and Bacalan, a docks and manufacturing area, La Cit\\xe9 anchors a growing tourist hub, which includes a huge, concrete German bunker that once housed U-boats(https://uboat.net/flotillas/bases/bordeaux.htm) during the Nazi occupation and is now being transformed into an underground arts center. , The few wine museums I have visited around the world have never quite fired the imagination. The more ambitious the museum, the more transparently promotional it is for a particular region, a certain producer or the benefits of wine. The most successful have been the most local, which have simply presented artifacts without forced narratives. , But La Cit\\xe9 consciously avoids the outright promotion and celebration of Bordeaux. Instead, it takes an ecumenical approach, looking at the scope of wine culture worldwide and letting history 4 and the people who make the wines 4 speak largely for themselves. ,  cThe challenge was to tell ourselves, 8We 9re not promoting wine, we 9re promoting wine culture, 9 said Sylvie Cazes, who was instrumental in pushing the Cit\\xe9 du Vin project forward both as a member of the Bordeaux City Council from 2008 to 2014, and as part of an important Bordeaux wine family that owns Ch\\xe2teau Lynch- Bages(https://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/bordeaux-wine-producer- profiles/bordeaux/pauillac/lynch-bages/), among other properties. , Vinexpo Bordeaux(http://www.vinexpo.com/events/vinexpo-bordeaux), a vast wine trade exposition held every two years, was a particular inspiration, she said. ,  cVinexpo works because all the wines of the world take part, Ms. Cazes said. cThat made it a success. , La Cit\\xe9 encompasses 10 levels, including a wine bar, a retail shop, exhibition spaces, areas for special tastings, a theater (named for Thomas Jefferson) and, on the top floor, a panoramic restaurant with gorgeous views of the city. , But at its heart is a permanent exhibition of 19 themed spaces that provide an overview of the world 9s vineyards, the development of domesticated grapevines, the intricacies of how wine is made, the nuances of tasting and drinking it, and historical presentations on transporting wine and enjoying it dating from 6000 B.C. , Ultimately, it poses the existential question of why humans have gone to such extreme efforts to create a beverage that is not essential to existence. , Upon arrival, visitors are issued a ccompanion du voyage, individual electronic guides about the size of cellphones that connect directly with each stop along the tour, explaining in eight languages exactly what you are looking at and how to interact with it. From there, you are on your own, free to wander among the exhibits at your own pace, in your own fashion. , You might begin with a dizzying virtual helicopter tour of the world 9s vineyards, a sweeping overview that spans the globe in about 15 minutes on three big, curved screens. Or you could watch winemakers discussing their vineyards, from the famous, like Dominique Lafon(http://www.decanter.com/wine/producer-profiles/domaine-des-comtes- lafon-producer-profile-245913/) in Meursault Perri\\xe8res(https://www.wine- searcher.com/regions-meursault+perrieres), one of the great sources of white Burgundy, to a monsignor at Alaverdi Monastery Wine Cellar(http://www.winesgeorgia.com/site/domaine/alaverdi-monastery-wine- cellar) in the country of Georgia, one of the cradles of wine civilization, where techniques have changed little over centuries. , The videos are so sharp that at one point I found I could not pay attention to the winemaker Wilhelm Haag of Fritz Haag(http://weingut-fritz- haag.de/vineyards/), a fine riesling producer in the Mosel region of Germany, because the backdrop 4 the astoundingly steep Juffer Sonnenuhr vineyard 4 distracted me with its beauty. , Displays explain how vines and grapes were domesticated, how they occupied exalted mythological positions within ancient societies and how vines adapt to wildly different terrains. , Atmospheric enhancements penetrate almost unconsciously as you examine the exhibit: birds singing, thunder, the sound of a helicopter. Later, while learning about the use of barrels and how wine evolves in them over time, I suddenly became aware that I was smelling oak, used in the construction of the display. , Not all the exhibits are so straightforwardly historic. A buffet table offers the opportunity for cindulging in the sensory experience of wine tasting, offering surprisingly effective examples of different aromas and textures, and the opportunity to test your nose if so inclined. , I especially enjoyed an animated presentation of how wine merchants through the ages challenged themselves over millenniums to transport wine overseas to customers who craved it. It 9s not strictly realistic, as one character chides a god: cYou 9re all the same. You have eternity but no patience. , The entire visit can take about two hours to complete, by which time you are ready for the glass of wine included with admission. , The permanent exhibition is geared toward anyone who wants to learn more about wine. La Cit\\xe9 also puts on two temporary exhibits a year, in conjunction with other wine regions, which go deeply into particular subjects like wine and art, or wine and music. , In its first year, Ms. Cazes said, 445,000 visitors came to the museum, which far surpassed initial projections. , One particularly hopeful sign for La Cit\\xe9 is that the city of Bordeaux is now attracting more visitors. Once drab and dirty, with few interesting places to visit or eat, Bordeaux has undergone a transformation in the last 15 years(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/travel/what-to-do-in-bordeaux.html). , The facades of its 18th- and 19th-century architecture, once gray with filth, are now sparkling. An extensive new tram system offers an easy-to-use mass transit network, and the narrow streets of the old city are bustling with busy restaurants and wine bars. In truth, many of the wine bars are so hip that it 9s much easier to find natural wines(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/dining/natural-raw-wine-fair.html) than it is to get a bottle of good, old Bordeaux. , As for whether La Cit\\xe9 can help to bridge the divide between the city and its surrounding wine industry, tourism will play a central role in whether it succeeds. The museum will serve as a point of departure for tours of the M\\xe9doc, the historic area encompassing the famous areas of Margaux, St.-Julien and Pauillac. Some will go by bus. Others will leave by boat from La Cit\\xe9, heading up the Garonne to the Gironde Estuary. , Tourism has not historically been encouraged in Bordeaux estates, Ms. Cazes said. Cellars were not equipped for visits and, she said, merchants in Bordeaux were concerned that visitors would buy wine directly from the producers rather than through their networks. , Indeed, the Bordeaux tourist board has a desk within La Cit\\xe9, she said, and is eager to sell tickets for tours. , _Follow NYT Food on Facebook(https://www.facebook.com/nytfood/), Instagram(https://instagram.com/nytfood), Twitter(https://twitter.com/nytfood) and Pinterest(https://www.pinterest.com/nytfood/).

(Alex Brandon/AP) _This post has been updated._ Teresa Manning 4 an antiabortion activist in charge of the Health and Human Services Department 9s family planning programs 4 resigned her post Friday, according to a department spokeswoman. Manning, who served as deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Population Affairs(https://www.hhs.gov/opa/), has spent much of her career fighting abortion and has publicly questioned the efficacy of several popular contraception methods. Her job included overseeing the Title X program, which provides family-planning funding for about 4 million poor Americans or those without health insurance. In an email Friday evening, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley confirmed Manning 9s resignation but did not provide\\xa0a reason for her abrupt departure.  cHHS would like to thank her for her service to this Administration and the American people, Oakley said. Manning was escorted from the building by security officials Friday.\\xa0 According to an HHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter, Manning already had turned in her badge and the escort allowed her to get back out through security. Her resignation does not appear to represent a major ideological shift in the department, since Valerie Huber, a prominent abstinence education advocate, has been named acting deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Population Affairs. Huber has served as chief of staff in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health since June. Manning, who was appointed by President Trump(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/01/trump- picks-antiabortion-activist-to-head-hhs-family-planning-program/) last May, formerly lobbied for the National Right to Life Committee and worked as a legislative analyst for the Family Research Council. She was one of several antiabortion activists and leaders Trump has picked for key positions at the agency. Like many conservatives who oppose abortion rights, Manning has repeatedly objected to the use of RU-486, or\\xa0mifepristone, which is often used with misoprostol\\xa0to trigger an abortion during the early stages of a pregnancy, as well as the morning-after pill. But she also has expressed deep skepticism of birth control overall, suggesting in a 2003 interview with NPR that ccontraception doesn 9t work.  cIts efficacy is very low, especially when you consider over years 4 which a lot of contraception health advocates want to start women in their adolescent years, when they 9re extremely fertile, incidentally, and continue for 10, 20, 30 years. The prospect that contraception would always prevent the conception of a child is preposterous, Manning said at the time. Abortion-rights activists protested Manning 9s appointment, saying someone opposed to contraception shouldn 9t oversee Title X. Her replacement has long advocated for abstinence education. Huber managed Ohio 9s abstinence program from 2004 to 2007 and subsequently led Ascend, a group initially founded as the National Abstinence Education Association. She says she prefers to use the term csexual risk avoidance, telling Focus on the Family 9s Citizen magazine that Ascend 9s mission is broader than telling teens not to have sex.  cI bristle at the terminology 8abstinence only, 9 because our programs are so holistic, Huber said. cThey contextualize a whole battery of different topics that surround a young person 9s decision whether to have sex or not. Rather than someone telling a young person, 8Do this, don 9t do that, 9 it 9s casting a vision for a young person 9s future. Some family planning advocates, such as Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive at the nonprofit Power to Decide, criticized the administration 9s decision to put Huber in charge of the Office of Population Affairs.  cManning 9s departure would be positive news except for the fact that the Trump administration has chosen to replace Manning with Valerie Huber, who is well known for placing ideology over an evidence-based approach to ensuring that young people have the information and services they need to avoid an unplanned pregnancy, said Ehrlich, whose group backs federal support for sex education and a wide range of contraception methods. cWhat we really need is for this administration to take women 9s health issues seriously and appoint an individual who is not only\\xa0well qualified for the position, but also values women. **Read more:** Behind closed doors, Trump signs bill allowing states to strip federal family planning funds from abortion providers\\xa0 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/04/13/behind-closed- doors-trump-signs-bill-allowing-states-to-strip-federal-family-planning- dollars-from-abortion-providers/?tid=a_mcntx&utm_term=.f918c0204c7c) Trump administration narrows Affordable Care Act 9s contraception mandate(https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump- administration-could-narrow-affordable-care-acts-contraception- mandate/2017/10/05/16139400-a9f0-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html) \\xa0  ",

Academics at Durham University found the \"apparent success\" of these wholly selective schools was down to their brighter and more advantaged pupils. They say increasing the number of schools that select pupils by ability would be dangerous for equality. The government said it was working to widen access to grammar schools. Grammar schools have a reputation for high academic achievement and dominate the top of the school league tables.     'Social segregation' But this research, based on the detailed results of nearly 550,000 pupils, suggests once the ability and social background of pupils is taken into account, grammar schools are no more or less effective than other schools. The research not only looked at the social backgrounds of grammar pupils, but also:   * rates of chronic poverty   * ethnicity   * home language   * special educational needs   * age in the year group  The findings suggest England's grammars take only a tiny proportion of pupils who are, or have been, eligible for free school meals.  Image copyrightGetty Images This is important, say the researchers, because such pupils' results tend to decline with every year they are on free meals. This means that other schools in selective areas are taking more than their fair share of the poorest and chronically poor pupils. The Conservative government had to abandon plans to allow new grammar schools to open, following its weak position in Parliament after the general election. But ministers are keen to continue to allow existing grammars to expand.  'No clear gain' An analysis of pupil numbers by the BBC(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42416365) showed the equivalent of 11 new selective schools had been created since 2010 as existing schools had expanded. Prof Stephen Gorard, from Durham's School of Education, said: \"Dividing children into the most able and the rest from an early age does not appear to lead to better results for either group. \"This means that the kind of social segregation experienced by children in selective areas in England, and the damage to social cohesion that ensues, is for no clear gain. \"This is not to decry the schools that are currently grammars, or the work of their staff. \"However, the findings mean that grammar schools in England endanger social cohesion for no clear improvement in overall results. The policy is a bad one.\" A Department for Education official said: \"We want every child to receive a world-class education and to give parents greater choice when it comes to picking the school that's right for them - grammar schools are a part of this. \"Around 60% of these schools already prioritise admissions for disadvantaged children, and we are continuing to work closely with the school sector to widen access further. \"Research shows that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds make better progress across core subjects in selective schools, and attain better results.\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: \"There is a wealth of evidence that selection at 11 works against the government's stated ambition of improving social mobility. \"Creating new grammars schools is not the best way to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Instead, greater investment in high quality early years education would have a bigger impact on life chances - 11 is too late to bridge the gap.\"   ",

A rise in the number of 18-year-olds by 2030 will push demand up by 50,000, the Higher Education Policy Institute says. A further 350,000 places will be needed to keep pace with the existing growing participation rate, it adds, but other factors may reduce that by 50,000. The government has set up a review of university fees and funding. Last year, 534,000 students were accepted on to the hundreds of mainly three- year degree courses on offer in England.    The Hepi report examines the impact of policy changes on university entrant rates, feeding a number of scenarios into the calculations to arrive at the 300,000 figure. The 18-year-old population has been declining steadily for a number of years, but from 2020 it will increase again, rising by nearly 23% by 2030, says Hepi.  Questions for future It estimates there will be 14,709 additional entrants arising from demography alone, which will amount to about 50,000 additional students by 2030. And if participation continues to increase at the current rate, about 350,000 extra places will be needed on top. Countervailing factors such as Brexit, are likely to reduce that total by about 50,000, the research says. Currently, more women than men go to university. And if males were to increase their rates of participation, the research says, 500,000 extra places would be needed in total by 2030. It notes that there is not much sign of a change ahead in this area but cautions that the higher education system would come under great pressure and require a comprehensive reassessment if there was.  'Large increase' Bahram Bekhradnia, one of the authors and Hepi president, said as nearly every new student required a government-subsidised loan, \"it is difficult to see - under the current finance model - how the policy of uncapped student recruitment can continue\". \"This is particularly pertinent given the constraints on public expenditure and the absence of any suggestion from the Treasury that more money will be available for higher education in the future,\" he added. The report says the policy consequences of this very likely large increase in demand need to be considered. \"Given the extent of the loan subsidy provided for student loans... the higher education budget will need to be significantly increased in order to meet the financial consequences,\" it says. They suggest a cap on student numbers may have to be reintroduced. A DfE spokesperson said: there were more people going to university than ever before - including record numbers of 18-year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds entering full-time. \"We want anyone with the talent and potential to have the opportunity to go to university, which is why we lifted the cap on student numbers and reduced barriers that people face. \"We are conducting a major review of post-18 education to ensure that the system provides genuine choice for young people, and students and taxpayers are getting value for money.\"   ",

Donovan gave the vendor 100 pesos and told him to keep the change. As he drove away, Donovan saw the man cross himself and look to the sky. , It was a small moment, probably forgettable for most people, but it resonated for the 36-year-old Donovan. For him, it stood in sharp contrast to the venom that marked so many of his previous interactions with strangers in a country that for years reviled him as the living embodiment of its bitter soccer rivalry with the United States. , It was also the kind of benign, ordinary exchange Donovan has been reveling in since moving to Mexico, a country he visited regularly as a player over the course of two decades but, by his own admission, never really got to know. , It has been just over two months since Donovan was lured out of retirement by Club Le\\xf3n, a storied team now lurking in the middle of the standings in Liga MX, Mexico 9s top division. , In purely soccer terms, the move has been a test of patience: Donovan has spent most of the games since he arrived sitting on the bench. But with his wife, Hannah, and their two young sons in tow, it has also been a chance for him to reset his relationship with Mexico, a soccer-crazed country where he may be more widely known than in the United States 4 though also widely loathed. , For years, as the soccer rivalry deepened between the neighboring countries, Mexican animosity toward the American team seemed to concentrate with laserlike focus on Donovan. He did not shy from this role, stoking the fires with provocative comments and once even urinating near the field at Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara before a practice(https://youtu.be/vJS9r5MWD3w?t=55s), an act that was caught on video and has never been forgotten in Mexico. , During matches in Mexico, particularly at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, fans greeted every touch of the ball by Donovan with searing choruses of jeers and epithets, and they bombarded him with cups and coins and sometimes far worse(http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer-news/2958947-us-mens-national-team- guatemala-world-cup-qualifying-match-tv-television) as he set up for corner kicks. , In an interview in 2012, Donovan took some of the blame for this caustic relationship, admitting he had been ca punk kid(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liQMaVZY_uM&feature=youtu.be&t=2m30s) earlier in his career. cI ran my mouth a lot and I said a lot of stupid things and I was very ignorant and I caused a lot of, probably, hatred toward me, he said. , But he was viewed by many in Mexico as a worthy adversary, with his playing prowess 4 and ability and willingness to conduct interviews in Spanish 4 earning him a grudging respect. Late in his career, perhaps in a sign of a softening in the relationship, Donovan appeared in a series(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Dz0wD1jeQ) of ads(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6zsw2rec6Q) for the Mexican lottery that played off the country 9s distaste for him. ,  cMexicans hated him in a joyous way, said Robert Andrew Powell, author of cThis Love Is Not for Cowards, a book about soccer and violence in Ju\\xe1rez, a Mexican border city. cThey got a lot of pleasure out of hating him. , Donovan has often said that he owes his career in part to Mexicans, specifically the immigrants and their children he played soccer with while growing up in Southern California. Had he grown up in a place where the sport was not a central part of the culture, he said, he might never have taken it up. , Still, despite all the times he played in Mexico as a member of the United States national team, he said, he never really saw or experienced much of the country beyond its airports and hotels and the infernal caldron of its stadiums. , The Le\\xf3n offer, he said, was a chance to set aside a cpretty simple and easy life of family and daily recreational tennis in California and really get to know the country in a deeper, more meaningful way. ,  cWhen this opportunity came up at first, it was a hard no, Donovan said in an interview this week. But the team persisted, and in short order, Donovan was on a plane to Le\\xf3n to check it out. He attended a match, met the team and the coaching staff, and took a tour of the city. ,  cThe only Mexico I 9ve really known is Cabo San Lucas, where you don 9t really leave the hotel, or Mexico City or Guadalajara for games, he said. cSo all I see is the hotel, a drive to the stadium where people are yelling at you, cursing at you. In the stadium, people are throwing stuff at you, booing you. That 9s the only Mexico I 9d ever known in a real way. So having the chance to just see it through a different lens was really enjoyable, even for just that 24 hours. , With his wife 9s encouragement, he signed a one-year deal. , Donovan quickly turned his decision into something of a political statement, taking an apparent swipe at President Trump 9s proposed border wall in a Twitter post. ,  cI don 9t believe in walls, I want to go to Mexico, dress in green and win trophies in Le\\xf3n, he wrote(https://twitter.com/landondonovan/status/952033551754522624), endearing himself to Le\\xf3n fans and to Mexicans more broadly. , The Le\\xf3n fan base 4 or a significant part of it 4 was quick to shelve its grievances and welcome him. On Jan. 15, he landed at the regional airport and was whisked to Le\\xf3n 9s stadium where, even though it was 9 p.m. on a Monday, more than 7,000 fans turned out to greet him. , In some quarters of the city, however, the club 9s decision to bring an aging former star out of retirement, no matter how good he may have been, was viewed as a cynical act of marketing with only a marginal chance of helping the team 9s performance. , But interviews with a range of fans outside the Le\\xf3n stadium last Saturday evening, before the team 9s most recent game, reflected a generosity of spirit toward Donovan, even if he has made only six appearances 4 all as a late-second-half substitute 4 in nine league and cup matches since joining the roster. , Alan Garc\\xeda, 25, a Le\\xf3n fan who works in a store that sells air compressors, said the news of Donovan 9s signing cwas like a bomb for us. ,  cWhat us fans are asking for is that they give him more playing time, he added. , But there would be none for Donovan that night. He remained a shadow on the bench in a 2-2 draw against Lobos BUAP, a team from the city of Puebla, and avoided reporters by ducking onto the team bus afterward. , Donovan acknowledged some irritation at his lack of playing time in the interview days later at the team 9s practice facility, a bare-bones compound, with three soccer fields and a weight room, at the end of an unmarked dirt road. ,  cI just want to help, and that 9s where it gets frustrating, he said. But his maturity, he said, has helped to keep his frustrations in check. Instead, he has been trying to help the club in other ways, providing guidance to younger players and setting an example on and off the field. , At the practice facility, he was unfailingly courteous to the grounds crew and other staff members, greeting everyone he encountered. An intern working for the team said Donovan, unlike most of the team 9s players, frequently stopped by the offices to say hello to the staff before heading to the locker room. , His schedule has been relentless: He did not have a day off until last weekend, and he seized the opportunity to take his family to San Miguel de Allende, a colonial city popular with tourists. There, as with everywhere else he has gone, strangers recognized him on the street and greeted him warmly, eager to talk about the team and soccer. ,  cHad I come here to live as a U.S. soccer player, it 9s different because they don 9t view you as one of their own, he said. But now that he had joined a Mexican team, he had, in essence, become a welcome part of Mexico 9s fabric. , While Donovan and his family 9s home is in a guarded residential enclave, he said they tried to live their lives as normally as possible, venturing out often to eat at the city 9s restaurants and shop at its stores. Even his decision to take his family with him, rather than leaving them in San Diego, was a commitment to a fully immersive experience, despite his initial and very serious concerns about the country 9s reputation for violence. , It 9s also why his thoughts during an interview easily returned to the pineapple salesman, to the few moments of pleasantries exchanged at the roadside, to the 50 pesos left behind as a tip and a thank you. In a country that once cursed the mere mention of his name, Donovan is now revealing a kinder face, and receiving one in return. ,  cThey 9re hardworking, they 9re nice people, they 9re trying to do good, they 9re trying to support their families, he said. ,  cIt 9s a perception I would never have had if I had just gone to Mexico City, to the Azteca, back to the hotel and back to the United States. And now I have such a greater appreciation for all of it.  ",

Several members of my family, who had been chatting animatedly over mugs of hot sweet tea, were abruptly silent. We were all packed in a modest hotel room in Rameswaram, an island off the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The unnatural moment of stillness was instantly noticeable for two reasons - the sudden peal of rain beating against the windows, and the fact that there is rarely silence when my family, who live on three continents and talk every day on WhatsApp, get to be together. My aunt, who had been lying casually on her hotel bed, stood up to reach for her handbag. She pulled out a sanitary towel and handed it over to me.    \"This will tide you over until we can stop by a pharmacy,\" she said. And looking rather sadly at me, she added: \"You know what this means, don't you?\" I didn't. \"You won't be able to come to the temple.\"  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption The \"holy baths\" at Rameswaram, where people take a dip to pay their respects to ancestors  Our family were not holidaying in Rameswaram. Although tourism and fishery are the two dominant industries of the 60 sq km (23 sq miles) island, we were there for a very specific and sombre reason. It had been a year since the death of my beloved grandmother, the glue that kept our trans-continental family close. On hearing the news of her death last December, we had all taken the next available flight to attend her funeral.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption Tamil Nadu is a popular pilgrimage destination. A recent fire at Meenakshi temple destroyed dozens of shops  There are numerous traditions in Hindu culture surrounding death, depending on which part of India you're from. My family observes a set of South Indian Hindu rituals for the death of someone close. We took her body back to our family home, wrapped her in white cotton, laid her on a large banana leaf and prayed together. The men took her body for cremation - a moment I wished I could have attended. We hadn't eaten meat for 15 days after her death. We performed a special ceremony 90 days after. We said our goodbyes to each other at the airport, promising that we would meet again for the next stage of the ritual, the final chapter of our mourning, at Rameswaram - a well-known Hindu pilgrimage site.  Image caption Megha Mohan's grandmother as a younger woman  It is where my grandmother performed the final rites when my grandfather died 36 years ago. Rameswaram is famous for its historic temple, perched on the Bay of Bengal. Legend says that this was the place from where the Hindu god Rama built a bridge across the sea to Sri Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor. At various points during the three flights and the bumpy car journey, I'd read about the long ornate corridors, sacred towers and huge engraved stone pillars, and how people came to Rameswaram at significant moments. I hadn't considered myself religious but it occurred to me that I was now also a pilgrim. I'd thought a lot about Rameswaram and what the final chapter of saying goodbye would be like in the months following my grandmother's death.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption Rameswaram is one of India's most popular centres for Hindu pilgrimage  Back in my aunt's hotel room, holding her sanitary pad, having her tell me that I was now excluded from entering the the final part of our shared family mourning, I found myself on the defensive. \"You're saying I can't come to the temple because I'm on my period?\" I asked curtly. She narrowed her eyes swiftly enough for me to know that that tone hadn't been welcome in my youth, and most certainly wouldn't be tolerated in adulthood. \"I'm sorry,\" I conceded quickly. \"But surely that's not what you're saying. You're not saying that I've flown all the way here to not be able to go with you inside the temple.\" \"It's not what I'm saying,\" she said. \"That's just the way it is.\" \"Says who, though?\" I pressed. \"It is the way it is. It is a big deal.\" The sentence was stern, indicating to everyone else in the room that it would not be wise to speak up in my defence even if they wanted to. They didn't. The decision was made. I would be waiting with the driver outside the temple. * * *  Find out more   * **From Our Own Correspondent** has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world   * Listen on iPlayer(http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlq), get the podcast(http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fooc) or listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST  * * * Growing up I'd been given a pass from family outings to the temple when I was menstruating. The reasons why varied. One aunt had told me that it was tradition preserved from a time when women didn't have modern sanitary materials to absorb menstrual flow. My mother had told me that it was because it was the one time of the month where women were exempt from any duties, including household chores, a time when women could rest completely. Speaking to academics recently, I found contradictory statements on exactly why women were excluded. One pointed to the Hindu practice of Chaupadi, where menstruating women are considered impure and unlucky during her period. Yet a priest told me that women are at their purest during their cycle and hence would be tainted by being exposed to others, even at a temple. * * *  You may also like: Banished for bleeding(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt- sh/banished_for_bleeding) My dad jokes about my first period(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-41324799/my-dad-jokes-about-my- first-period) 'It's OK to make mayonnaise while on your period'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-41311476/it-s-ok-to-make- mayonnaise-while-on-your-period) * * * Dr Arvind Sharma, a professor of religion at McGill University in Montreal who specialises in the role of women in Hinduism, said the restriction has to do with concepts of ritual purity and impurity. \"There are certain times when human beings are considered ritually impure, as upon contact with a dead body, or excreta and so on. Women are considered so during periods,\" he says, \"It's hard to answer why as religious texts do not give reasons. \"The form of Hinduism we are talking about here is Smarta Hinduism, or the kind of Hinduism found in the Smritis (ancient Hindu texts). But in Shakta Hinduism (which is the body of Hinduism that celebrates the feminine, the Goddesses), menstruation is considered purifying rather than polluting.\"  Image copyrightVidya Nair Menstruation has been a hot topic in India in recent years, with activists running missions to provide sanitary napkins to rural women. Indian women have also challenged taboos attached to menstruation by staging social media campaigns using provocative hashtags like HappyToBleed. A recent Bollywood film Pad Man, which has been called the world's first feature film on periods(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment- arts-42732782), explored the subject. The film is inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26260978), a Tamil Nadu- based social activist who campaigned to provide low-cost sanitary pad machines in rural parts of South India where few women have access to them. The lead actor Akshay Kumar said: \"I have lived with women all my life, yet I have learnt more about the topic while making this film than ever before. This is not the Stone Age - menstruating is natural.\" All this played on my mind as I waited outside the temple, watching my family head through the gates.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption The \"corridor of 1,000 pillars\" at Rameswaram  I reached for my phone to WhatsApp a female cousin, who couldn't make it to the final ritual. She sympathised with me, and then she paused typing for a few moments. \"You shouldn't have told them you were on your period,\" she wrote finally. \"They wouldn't have known.\" \"Have you been to the temple on your period?\" I asked. \"Most women our age have,\" she said casually, and contradicting my aunt's earlier statement just half an hour earlier, she added, \"It's not that big a deal if no-one knows.\"  _Follow Megha Mohan on Twitter_@meghamohan(https://twitter.com/meghamohan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  _Join the conversation - find us on_Facebook(https://www.facebook.com/BBCStories/) _,_Instagram(https://www.instagram.com/bbcstories/) _,_YouTube(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgKRB26m6M3okTSP7C_UwA) _and_Twitter(https://twitter.com/bbcstories) _._   ,  Have you had a similar experience?

        "article": " At George Mason University, where I teach, I regularly have lunch with a group of economists that includes a libertarian provocateur with an impish sense of humor named Bryan Caplan. Whether you agree with him or not (I usually don 9t), Bryan makes you think hard about what you believe and what you think that you know. Now he 9s is out with a new jeremiad, cThe Case Against Education, in which he argues that Americans waste hundreds of billions of dollars a year on a higher-education system that teaches too little to too many. Citing copious amounts of social science data, Caplan calculates that at least half of the 67 percent premium earned by the average college graduate can be explained simply by the talent, knowledge and discipline that they already had when they arrived for freshman orientation. Much of the rest, he argues, is merely a signal to employers that college graduates are willing to put up with four years of (mostly) boring lectures and (mostly) tedious assignments in courses that (mostly) serve no purpose other than to test perseverance and willingness to conform to a prevailing culture. At most, he figures, only 20\\xa0percent of the college premium reflects any actual learning and skill development. For the typical student, he writes, a year in college cneither raises their productivity nor enriches their lives. If it is the coursework that makes college students more valuable workers, Caplan asks, then why don 9t more people skip the admissions process and the tuition and just sneak into large lecture courses to soak up that valuable knowledge free? If it is classroom learning that matters, why does the labor market offer almost no wage premium to those who have successfully completed one, two or even three years of college, while providing a sizable premium to those who have completed four? And why do tests taken before and after college reveal almost no retention of course material and little in the way of progress on generalized skills such as critical thinking and statistical analysis? As Caplan sees it, our higher-education system is an effective but needlessly costly system for signaling employers about which workers to hire. The same goal, he suggests, could be accomplished with a smaller system that educates a much smaller number of talented and engaged students in practical subjects like science and engineering. Everyone else would be left to develop job skills at technical schools, in apprenticeships or on the job. Caplan calculates that while those who stick it out and earn a degree earn a good return on their personal investment, that doesn 9t apply to the half of poorly performing students who drop out. And as for public spending on higher education, he estimates rates of return ranging from paltry to negative, due to the high costs and dropout rates and the modest effect that additional higher education seems to have on economic output. If you find all this hard to swallow, you are not alone. There are plenty of reasons to think that Caplan has overreached in his gloomy conclusions. His book is full of clever but faulty logic and rhetorical straw men set up and easily knocked down. Many of his conclusions reflect the overconfidence of the social scientist who thinks everything that matters has been accurately measured in cthe data, and the narrow focus of the economist who confuses education and worker training. He ignores the value of sports and other non-classroom experiences that often reveal interests and hidden talents and help to shape character and ambition. He too easily dismisses the importance of exposing young people to new ideas and values and life possibilities, and recognizes no role for higher education in equalizing opportunity, creating a shared set of cultural values or having more informed voters. At times, Caplan tells us that labor markets are rational and efficient. At other times, not so much. Yet nowhere in the book is there evidence that he talked to real employers or real workers about how labor markets really work. And when confronted with the fact that people in every successful country seem to have made the same mistake of investing more of their new wealth on education, Caplan writes it off to csocial desirability bias, a kind of political correctness that causes people to refuse to accept unpleasant truths about themselves and others. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wSUPJVcxcEDG9DVvdGTdFYS1oBU=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R57I5OBCHII6RFDMSQQAMDFXXU.jpg)  As long as graduates earn a 67 percent wage premium, universities will continue to focus on ways to enroll more students. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) What is unfortunate is that these flaws will make it easy for people 4 particularly those in higher education 4 to ignore the very real evidence Caplan presents that our system of higher education is not all it 9s cracked up to be. For starters, you don 9t have to be an elitist to conclude that too many students are showing up at too many universities unprepared. That may be because high schools have failed to teach the knowledge or skills or study habits that they need, or that at 18 they are not emotionally mature enough for the challenge, or that they are simply bored by classroom learning. Whatever the reason, the right solution is to develop other pathways to career and life success. That may be as simple as encouraging students to take a few years off after high school to do something else, or creating a system of high-quality vocational and technical training, or relying more on internships and apprenticeships to determine career interests and develop basic skills. The idea that a traditional college education is right for everyone who reaches age 18, or that it is necessary for getting a good job or achieving success in life 4 that is simply wrong. As I regularly remind my Mason students, life rarely proceeds in a straight line. Caplan is also right that too many college courses are focused on transmitting specialized knowledge that we will never remember or use, and not enough on teaching students to analyze data, think logically and critically, come to reasonable conclusions and make a clear and cogent argument. There are also important social skills to be developed. These are the things that will be important long after students have forgotten what the War of the Roses was all about or the third law of thermodynamics. Some schools have begun to require teachers to fill out all sorts of forms identifying clearning outcomes and demonstrating how the course achieves them, but like so much in education, this has wound up being mostly a box-checking exercise. The reality is that while university provosts, deans and department chairmen give lip service to improving educational quality and accountability, they haven 9t done much about it. One reason is that today 9s students are surprisingly complacent and don 9t demand it. But the bigger reason is that professors resist it as a violation of their academic freedom and independence. Professors are hired and evaluated on the basis of their academic pedigree and research chops, not their ability to teach undergraduates. Once they are hired 4 and certainly once they get tenure 4 nobody reviews their syllabi, sits in on their classes or speaks to their students about their classroom experience. That 9s not to say there aren 9t many good and effective professors who take pride in their teaching and care about their students. But from an organizational perspective, the absence of quality control and the lack of focus on the experience 4 what is taught, how it is taught and how it can be improved 4 is a big problem. Caplan is also right to warn of the danger of an educational arms race. To attract more students and ensure that they graduate, too many universities have lowered standards and reduced their workload, making the college degree a less valuable signal to employers about who they are hiring. In turn, more students have come to believe they must earn a graduate degree to attract the attention of employers. One reason the returns on investment for higher education are not greater has to do with how big the investment has become. Despite all the hand-wringing about tuition increases and student debt, universities have never been serious about making the kind of deep structural changes that could lower costs and tuitions without sacrificing quality. There is serious money to be saved by trimming bureaucracies, making more extensive and creative use of teaching technology, altering schedules and calendars to make more efficient use of buildings and equipment and eliminating support for faculty research that is mediocre or lacks impact. The unfortunate reality, however, is that as long as their graduates earn a 67 percent wage premium, universities will continue to focus on ways to enroll more students rather than delivering better value to 4 and demanding more from 4 the students they already have.

          "article": " ONE of the biggest ideas to hit the political world in recent years is that politics is increasingly defined by the division between open and closed, rather than left and right. Openness means support for both economic openness (welcoming immigration and free trade) and the cultural sort (embracing ethnic and sexual minorities). Closedness means the opposite. This argument, which _The Economist_ explored in a cover article a couple of years ago, has recently been reinforced by the launch of a new think-tank, Global Future. Global Future marked its arrival with an opinion poll which suggests not only that the open-closed division is the most salient one in British politics, but that copen has time on its side. There is a 51-percentage-point difference between the under-45s and the over-45s on the question of whether immigration is a force for good, for example.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Donald Trump won by promising to put America first. But Bagehot is reluctant to give it the same force as the old distinction between left and right. The division is too self-serving for comfort. It looks more like ammunition for a political war than dispassionate analysis, and thereby contributes to the polarisation that it claims to diagnose. There are also too many facts that don 9t fit. Consider Brexit. Remainers regard it as the quintessential revolt against the open society. Yet some of the most prominent Leavers, such as Daniel Hannan and Douglas Carswell, are classical liberals who regard the European Union as a protectionist bloc that is bent on subsidising inefficient industries. It is true that the UK Independence Party thrived on fears of immigration. But at the height of its popularity it received only 4m votes, whereas 17m voted to leave. A poll of 12,000 Leavers found that their main motive, cited by 49%, was democratic self-government. By their own lights they were voting against a closed elite in favour of open and accountable government. The most obvious problem with the open-closed theory is that the divide is so slippery. Few people support entirely open societies 4it would be perverse to allow Ebola victims to cross borders unimpeded. By the same token, few people advocate becoming a hermit kingdom like North Korea. Nor are open and closed necessarily opposites. Having a strong border can make people more open, by giving them a sense that they can manage openness. Historically, most of the world 9s great centres of commerce have been walled cities. Constantinople, the crossroads between east and west, boasted not just a formidable wall but an outer and inner harbour. And different forms of openness and closedness don 9t always go together. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is open when it comes to transgender rights and immigration, but closed when it comes to foreign companies owning British utilities, or trade unions operating closed shops. Many Brexiteers are the opposite. The biggest problem with the open-closed divide, however, is that open people often aren 9t as open as they think 4indeed, they are open in so far as it serves their interests and no further. The young cosmopolitans celebrated by Global Future are closed when it comes to giving a fair hearing to social conservatives. Try opposing gay marriage in a college bar and you will discover the meaning of Herbert Marcuse 9s phrase crepressive tolerance d. This is even clearer in economics, where open people cluster in industries that have been less affected by globalisation than manufacturing. Steelworkers have been upended by competition from China. Public-sector bureaucrats have not been touched. Supposedly open people have also protected themselves from competition by constructing a wall of licences, restrictions and other barriers to entry. The post-1979 deregulation of the economy was one-sided. Working-class closed shops, such as that of the printworkers, were broken, while professional closed shops, notably for barristers, were left to thrive. Academics like to think of themselves as open to their core. But academia is rife with restrictive practices. The most highly prized commodity in academic life is tenure 4that is, the right to an income for life whatever happens to the world. University towns have some of the strictest planning laws around, so that insiders see the value of their most important asset soar. Academic publishers make their profits by rolling several sorts of rent- seeking together. They get free content because academics have to publish to get tenure, and a guaranteed market because academic libraries have to buy their books and journals. Bankers have similar double standards. Critics rightly point out that they are arch-globalists when the market is on the up, but then turn to national governments when it crashes. But the problem runs deeper. Like other industries, finance is rigged from the inside by firms that invest in lobbyists and hire ex-politicians who still wield influence. The real divide There is a better explanation of political polarisation than the open-closed split. It is the gap between exam-passers and exam-flunkers. Qualifications grant access to a world that is protected from the downside of globalisation. You can get a job with a superstar company that has constructed moats and drawbridges to protect itself, or with a middle-class guild that provides job security, or with the state bureaucracy. Failing exams casts you down into an unpredictable world of cut-throat competition. Exam-passers combine a common ability to manage the downside of globalisation with a common outlook 4call it narcissistic cosmopolitanism 4that binds them together and legitimises their disdain for rival tribes. Exam- flunkers, meanwhile, are united by anger at the elitists who claim to be open as long as their jobs are protected. They are increasingly willing to bring the system crashing down. Talking about open v closed is a double error. It obscures the deeper forces dividing the world, and spares winners by playing down the legitimate concerns of losers.

The Alphabet Inc.(/quote/GOOGL:US \"Company Overview\") unit had cirrefutable policies, memorialized in writing and consistently implemented in practice, of systematically discriminating in favor job applicants who are Hispanic, African American, or female, and against Caucasian and Asian men, according to the complaint filed in state court in Redwood City, California. Arne Wilberg, who worked at Google and its YouTube unit for about nine years both as a contractor and an employee, claims he was terminated in retaliation for complaining to human resources about the company 9s hiring practices. Wilberg also alleged that late last year, management deleted emails and other digital records of diversity requirements.

In March 2017, a YouTube staffing manager emailed recruiters and told them, \"Please continue with L3 level three candidates in process and only accept new L3 candidates that are from historically underrepresented groups.\" In another email, the same manager wrote, \"We should only consider L3s from our underrepresented groups.\"     The case is Wilberg v.

        "article": " KABUL, Afghanistan 4 With three children under the age of five and a husband who could neither read nor write, 25-year-old Jahantap Ahmadi dreamed of going to college. Her high school degree was enough to become a teacher at the only elementary school in her village in central Afghanistan __ in an open field 4 but she wanted more. On March 15, cheered on by her husband, Jahantap set out for the Daikundi provincial capital of Nili to take the university entrance exam. She walked until her feet were blistered and bruised and then sat for 10 hours with her infant daughter, Khezran, cradled on her lap in a rickety bus over rugged rocky roads. Once in Nili, she took the exam and scored a respectable 152 out of a possible 200. But it was a picture of Jahantap posted on Facebook, sitting cross-legged on the classroom floor, her 2-month-old baby asleep on her lap as she took the exam, that made the dream of going to college come true. A teacher in Nili who was moved by Jahantap 9s determination to get an education posted pictures on Facebook. In Afghanistan, where women still struggle for even the most basic of rights, it went viral.  cMy brother who was working in Kabul called me and said 8I saw your picture in Facebook, 9 she said in an interview in Kabul where she is now enrolled at a private university. cI wanted to get my education, so I could help my village, change my village. I want to help my society. But first I wanted it for my children, so one day they could be educated. Nearly 17 years after the overthrow of the Taliban government, which outlawed women 9s education, an estimated 6 million children are in school in Afghanistan and a third of them are girls. However, most girls don 9t study beyond elementary school, and of the 3.5 million Afghan children who have never gone to school, 75 percent are girls, according to the 2017 annual report of the United Nations Children 9s Fund, which was released in February. Zahra Yagana, who runs a small non-governmental organization that provides awareness of the environment and the value of education, said the picture of Jahantap on the floor, while other students sat at desks, inspired her to get Jahantap to Kabul and into a university.  cLife is still very difficult for women in Afghanistan. We need the international community to stay for 50 or 100 years to change things here for women, said Yagana.  cWhen I saw the picture of Jahantap on Facebook, I was so impressed, she said. cRight away the next day I wrote a story about her, but I thought we have to do something for her, help her get her education. She inspired me. Yagana went to the government and recruited Farkhunda Zahra Naderi, a senior adviser to President Ashraf Ghani, as well as Sarwar Danish, a vice president. Naderi is paying Jahantap 9s university tuition and Danish will pay the rent on the family 9s home in Kabul.  cThey said she is a symbol for women and education, said Yagana. In a country that remains deeply conservative and patriarchal, Jahantap 9s husband, Musa Mohammadi, would seem an anomaly.  cI am so proud of my wife, said Mohammadi, who never attended school and is illiterate.  cThat 9s not the life I want for my children, he said. cI see a sign on the road and I can 9t read it. I go to the pharmacy to get medicine, but I can 9t read the name of the pills. That 9s not right. It is very difficult for me. Before taking her entrance exams in March, Mohammadi said his wife taught children in the open field beneath the blistering summer sun. cI saw how many people wanted education. They all brought their children for her to teach. His uncle, Mohammad Reza Hesani, said when Jahantap married Mohammadi she bought pens and books for the children in her new husband 9s family, most of whom had never been to school.  cJahantap has given light to the women in our village, said Hesani. cWe respect her. My wife is so interested now in going to school after she saw Jahantap. Still, there 9s a lingering fear that any peace deal with the Taliban would set back the fragile gains made over the last 17 years. Already, women 9s rights groups have assailed Ghani 9s government for failing to pass legislation to protect women and allowing clerics to rail against rights for women, stalling the little progress made thus far. Masuda Karokhi, a member of parliament, told The Associated Press she is ctired and disappointed that each time legislators press for laws to advance the rights of women, including a law to eliminate violence against women, conservative members intervene to delay it. She said the government panders to those members at the expense of women 9s rights. A 2017 Human Rights Watch report on Afghanistan said attempts to reform family law, including divorce provisions, have stalled. At a conference on violence against women, Karokhi said one conservative member of parliament argued that Islamic law allowed for violence against women.  cWhy is it that if a woman laughs, these conservative men say there is something in Shariah (Islamic law) that says it is wrong, but men can do anything and there is nothing in Shariah against them, Karokhi said. cIt 9s so disappointing and frustrating, the attitudes of men in Afghanistan. ____ Associated Press writer Amir Shah contributed to this report.

        "article": "  **Rabat, Morocco -** Overcrowding, the lack of an efficient strategy and poor administration are harming public schools in Morocco(https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/morocco.html)\\xa0and diminishing the opportunities available to underprivileged children, experts, teachers and students have told Al Jazeera.  The crisis in the education sector comes despite repeated efforts by successive governments to reform the archaic system.  Meanwhile, social disparity is widening with the growth of private schools as higher-income families increasingly opt to pay for better services, threatening those who rely on free and quality education.  Despite high tuition costs, the number of those shifting from public to private schools soared from 4 percent in 1999 to 15 percent in 2015.  A World Economic Forum report in 2015 placed Morocco at 101 out of 140 countries in a quality of education index.  According to a 2014 Unesco report, Morocco was ranked among the 21 worst countries in the field of education, with more than half of students in public schools failing to acquire necessary reading and maths skills.  > It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career.\\r > > Anas Mrabti, high school student > >   Morocco's King Mohammed VI has highlighted the dire situation on several occasions.  \"The education system faces many difficulties and problems especially due to adopting some programmes and educational curricula, which do not suit the requirements of the labour market,\" King Mohammed said in a speech on August 20, 2013.  \"The current situation in the education and training sectors requires an assessment process that measures achievements and identifies the weaknesses and imbalances,\" he added.  Anas Mrabti, a high school student at a public school in Rabat, expressed concern over the future of underprivileged pupils.  \"It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"The majority of students at public schools come from poor families, who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools. The dilemma is that there is a big gap between the public and private schools in terms of quality education and services.\"  He added that financial disparities could affect higher education.  \"Students from public schools find it very difficult to compete with students from private schools to access reputable institutions and universities. Parents normally send their kids to private schools because they know that those schools can earn their kids higher marks,\" he said.  Because privately-educated children usually attain better grades, it becomes \"very difficult for students from public schools to \\u2026 access major universities and institutions,\" said the student.\\xa0   'Students not equipped'   ****In recent years, successive governments have tried to implement structural adjustments to increase access to education and improve the education system's performance, the latest of which is the Council of Education's \"Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School\".  This strategy was first implemented in 2015 and is expected to continue until 2030.\\xa0  But so far, there have been few solutions.  According to Mohammed, a headmaster of a public school in Tetouan who declined to give his last name, \"the educational field has been suffering for a while from the gap between theory and practice, and of the gap between ideas and application\".  He told Al Jazeera: \"Students are not equipped with the practical skills they need to integrate them into the job market.  \"Our public schools are like buildings lacking pillars that keep them standing. Any major reform bid needs to transform goals into practical solutions.\"  An academic researcher, who preferred not to give his name, agreed that the Ministry of Education's previous and current attempts at reform were superficial.  \"All reform attempts were inspired by Western models that do not take into consideration the possibility of application, and whether the country is ready to apply such reforms on ground.  \"The country has its own identity and characteristics. The setup of any effective reform plan can only be achieved through a participatory approach that should include academics, educational syndicates, researchers and trainers.  \"Securing logistics and funding are not enough to ensure good educational quality. Public schools used to enjoy a good reputation in the past, and the authorities in this country should restore that dignity by finding solutions for such a vital sector.\"  Mohamed Jouji, a retired father who has two daughters in private schools, said Morocco is far from achieving its goals in the public education sector.  \"The issues are mainly school dropouts, weak numbers of schooling in the rural world, the high illiteracy rate, and the deterioration of educational performance,\" Jouji told Al Jazeera.   The end of free education?   ****Another headache added to the Moroccan burden is a new draft bill introduced by the government, which aims at putting an end to free education in the kingdom.  The bill proposes that preschool, primary and secondary education should remain free of charge for all Moroccans, but suggests registration fees for high schools and universities for middle and high-income families.  The draft law has angered parents and education syndicates, who consider the move a violation of Moroccan citizens' right to free education.  ",

And what kind of ideas will you be promoting? Betsy DeVos: I have actually asked to head up a task force that will really look at what states are doing. \\xa0See there are a lot of states that are addressing these issues in very cohesive and coherent ways. Lesley Stahl: Do you feel a sense of urgency? Betsy DeVos: Yes. Lesley Stahl: 'Cause this sounds like talking. Instead of acting. Betsy DeVos: No, there is a sense of urgency indeed.  \"I hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.\" The reason Betsy DeVos wanted to be secretary of education was so she could promote school choice, offering parents options other than traditional public schools 3 where 90 percent of kids go. She has proposed massive cuts in public education funding and wants to shift billions to alternative players like private, parochial and charter schools. Betsy DeVos: We have invested billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal level And we have seen zero results. Lesley Stahl: But that really isn't true. Test scores have gone up over the last 25 years. So why do you keep saying nothing's been accomplished? Betsy DeVos: Well actually, test scores vis-\\xe0-vis the rest of the world have not gone up. And we have continued to be middle of the pack at best. That's just not acceptable. Lesley Stahl: No it's not acceptable. But it's better than it was. That's the point. You don't acknowledge that things have gotten better. You won't acknowledge that, over the-- Betsy DeVos: But I don't think they have for too many kids. We've stagnated Lesley Stahl: Okay, so there's the big argument. So what can be done about that? Betsy DeVos: What can be done about that is empowering parents to make the choices for their kids. Any family that has the economic means and the power to make choices is doing so for their children. Families that don't have the power, that can't decide: \"I'm gonna move from this apartment in downtown whatever to the suburb where I think the school is gonna be better for my child\" if they don't have that choice 3 and they are assigned to that school, they are stuck there. I am fighting for the parents who don't have those choices. We need all parents to have those choices.\\xa0  \"We should be funding and investing in students, not in school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems.\" Question is: does her solution work? Do choice schools perform better than public schools? Naturally -- there are conflicting studies. It's complicated. But DeVos spends a lot of time showcasing choice schools like Cold Spring Elementary, a public school in Indianapolis 3 that was allowed to get rid of the local teachers' union and create an innovative curriculum. But when parents choose these options, taxpayer funds follow the child and that means that the public school left behind can end up with less money. Lesley Stahl: Why take away money from that school that's not working, to bring them up to a level where they are-- that school is working? Betsy DeVos: Well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school-- school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. Lesley Stahl: Okay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that's not working? What about those kids? Betsy DeVos: Well, in places where there have been-- where there is-- a lot of choice that's been introduced-- Florida, for example, the-- studies show that when there's a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually-- the results get better, as well. !0311-60mins-betsy2.jpg (https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/11/a2a5f0cd-f379-4ca0-bbd5-e70a6dc01908/resize/770x/243981d29ef1d3c319504203e025e205/0311 -60mins-betsy2.jpg) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos works with students at Cold Spring School in Indianapolis  CBS News Lesley Stahl: Now, has that happened in Michigan? We're in Michigan. This is your home state. Betsy DeVos: Michi--Yes, well, there's lots of great options and choices for students here. Lesley Stahl: Have the public schools in Michigan gotten better? Betsy DeVos: I don't know. Overall, I-- I can't say overall that they have all gotten better. Lesley Stahl: The whole state is not doing well. Betsy DeVos: Well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this-- the students are doing well and-- Lesley Stahl: No, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in Michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. Betsy DeVos: I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Lesley Stahl: The public schools here are doing worse than they did. Betsy DeVos: Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. Lesley Stahl: Have you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they're doing? Betsy DeVos: I have not-- I have not-- I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. Lesley Stahl: Maybe you should. Betsy DeVos: Maybe I should. Yes. DeVos is the only Cabinet secretary protected by a squad of U.S. Marshals because she's gotten death threats. She's frequently met by protesters who accuse her of pushing an elitist agenda. She often manages to offend, as when she called historically black colleges and universities \"pioneers\" of \"school choice\" 3 as though they had a choice. At this commencement speech at Bethune-Cookman University, students booed and turned their backs to her. Lesley Stahl: Why have you become, people say, the most hated Cabinet secretary? \\xa0 Betsy DeVos: I'm not so sure exactly how that happened. But I think there are a lot of really powerful forces allied against change. Lesley Stahl: Does it hurt? Betsy DeVos: Sometimes it does. Sometimes it does. Again, I think-- I think-- Lesley Stahl: Do you ever say-- Betsy DeVos: \\xa0--I'm more misunderstood than anything. !0311-60mins-betsy4.jpg (https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/11/44c35690-d5b0-40ec- b9d7-dce9b8d8edb8/resize/770x/fcc44d4b9f76db1d5a18243254d16e1e/0311-60mins- betsy4.jpg) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos  CBS News Some of the criticism, she feels, is unfair, especially when it involves her wealth. She faced a hostile question about it during a speech at Harvard last year. Harvard Question: So you're a billionaire with lots and lots of investments. And the so-called school choice movement is a way to open the floodgates for corporate interests to make money off the backs of students. How much do you expect your net worth to increase as a result of your policy choices? Moderator: You can choose not to answer that secretary. Among President Trump's cabinet of moguls and titans, DeVos is the richest: she grew up wealthy and married even wealthier. In their hometown of Grand Rapids, the DeVoses have been exceedingly charitable, their name decorates buildings like the civic center and children's hospital. At her bruising confirmation hearing, she was grilled about her wealth and lack of experience. She's been an advocate, not an educator. \\xa0\\xa0 Lesley Stahl: What happened there? Betsy DeVos: I've not had a root canal, but I can imagine that a root canal might be more pleasant than that was. Lesley Stahl: So you've been on the job now over a year. What have you done that you're most proud of? Betsy DeVos: Yeah. We've begun looking at and rolling back a lot of the overreach of the federal government in education. By overreach she means regulations. And like most of President Trump's cabinet, DeVos is a devoted de-regulator. Part of her job as Secretary of Education is overseeing guidelines that protect the civil rights of students. Just days after being confirmed, she rescinded a guideline implemented under President Obama that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice 3 sparking even more protests. She is now considering scrapping the Obama-era \"guidance on how to identify, avoid and remedy discriminatory discipline,\" which aims to prevent schools from punishing students of color more harshly than their white classmates. Betsy DeVos: We are studying that rule. We need to ensure that all students have an opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. And all students means all students. Lesley Stahl: Yeah but let's say there's a disruption in the classroom and a bunch of whites kids are disruptive and they get punished, you know, go see the principal, but the black kids are, you know, they call in the cops. I mean, that's the issue: who and how the kids who disrupt are being punished. Betsy DeVos: Arguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids. And-- Lesley Stahl: Well, no. That-- it's not. Betsy DeVos: --it does come down to individual kids. And--often comes down to-- I am committed to making sure that students have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is conducive to their learning. Lesley Stahl: Do you see this disproportion in discipline for the same infraction as institutional racism? Betsy DeVos: We're studying it carefully. And are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments. While this regulation is under review, she has already drawn fire for changing Title IX guidelines on handling sexual assault on college campuses. She's allowing colleges to require stronger evidence from accusers, and give the accused a greater benefit of the doubt. Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way, do you think, suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes or assaults? Betsy DeVos: Well, one sexual assault is one too many, and one falsely accused individual is one too many. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but are they the same? Betsy DeVos: I don't know. I don't know. But I'm committed to a process that's fair for everyone involved. Lesley Stahl: The Me-Too Movement has come along at the same time. This is all feeding into it. We're not talking about colleges anymore. We're talking about men in positions of power in industry and government. Have you ever had an issue? Betsy DeVos: I can recall a number of moments in the past-- several decades ago that I think today would just be viewed as unacceptable. Yeah. It's been an unlikely journey and balancing act for grandmother Betsy DeVos, from her sheltered life in Michigan 3 to her life now as a lightning rod in Washington.  _Produced by Shachar Bar-On.

In a speech at a meeting in Washington of state school chiefs from across the country, she also accused them of failing to use enough imagination in implementing the K-12 federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act, and said she was delivering a dose of ctough love. She said: > ESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs 4 including many in this room 4 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state 9s unique challenges. Well, this law gives you that chance. > > The trouble is . . . I don 9t see much evidence that you 9ve yet seized it. Without mentioning specifics, DeVos blamed the graduation scandal on the Obama administration for dictating education policy rather than allowing states to make their own choices, as has been traditional. In her speech to the Council of Chief State School Officers, she said: > We also should be able to clearly gauge the progress of all our nation 9s students. That, too, hasn 9t been a simple task over the years. Previous efforts focused on a goal 4 such as higher graduation rates 4 and if you didn 9t meet it, you 9d face the ire of cBig Ed. > > While that goal might have been laudable, we 9ve seen what happens. Just look at the ongoing scandal right here in our nation 9s capital, where school administrators fudged the rules and graduated kids who otherwise wouldn 9t have been eligible 4 all in response to top-down pressure. _ There 9s good and bad news for Betsy DeVos on her anniversary as U.S. education secretary (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2018/02/07/theres-good-and-bad-news-for-betsy-devos-on-her-first- anniversary-as-u-s-education-secretary/?utm_term=.562ed021c825)_ DeVos referenced the D.C. scandal in which it was discovered that one in three high school seniors were awarded diplomas last year even though they did not meet the requirements. The graduation rate for the city 9s high schools was 73 percent in 2017, but data released last week showed that only 42 percent of seniors at traditional D.C. public schools are on track to graduate, with 19 percent cmoderately off-track. The city report, ordered by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser after media reports alleged graduation fraud at Ballou High School, said that educators in the D.C. school system had long felt pressure to raise graduation rates. In her speech, DeVos linked such pressure to what she called cmicromanagement from Washington. _ D.C. mayor called her ousted school chancellor 9s action 8indefensible. 9 He says she knew about it for months. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/dc-mayor-muriel-bowser- called-her-ousted-school-chancellors-action-indefensible-the-chancellor-says- bowser-knew-about-it-for-months/2018/03/05/d909cbc3-6e34-49f8-995f- 22e1dd2ea5aa_story.html?utm_term=.7da45e4b9df3)_ Barack Obama 9s education secretary, Arne Duncan, exercised unprecedented federal power in pushing states to implement school reform policies\\xa0the administration favored. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who heads the Senate Education Committee, derisively called Duncan 9s department ca national school board. And Congress rewrote the K-12 federal education law, then known as No Child Left Behind, to return much of the power to the states. DeVos has made clear since she took office in February 2017 that she is no fan of the federal government (she once said cgovernment sucks d) and doesn 9t believe there should be a federal Education Department. She has also advanced a new definition of caccountability for schools, saying that she is not focused on the Obama-era metrics of standardized test scores but rather on how fast states and districts create alternatives to traditional public schools for children. Here is the full text of her March 5 speech, as prepared for delivery, provided by the Education Department: > Thank you, Carey, for that kind introduction. I want to thank each of the chiefs, and your teams, for everything you do to ensure the students you serve are well-prepared for successful careers and fulfilling lives. And I also want to thank you for your partnership over the past year. > > Our relationship will become even more important following the tragedy in Parkland, Florida. No student, no parent, no teacher should ever have to experience what many did at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Pam, we 9ve already worked closely in the wake of this tragedy and I appreciate your dedication and strength. > > We must have an open and honest conversation about what went wrong, and what we must do now to ensure our children are safe at school. I look forward to hearing your ideas and working with you. > > I know we may sometimes differ on what policy levers to pull, as there is no one-size-fits all approach for every state, or for every community. And there will be varying solutions. I hope we can always stay focused on individual students. > > That must be our aim every day, in everything we do. Accordingly, it must be at the core of implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act. > > When this bipartisan bill was written, passed and signed, it signaled a shift in America 9s approach to education policy. Unlike prior efforts, ESSA was born of a recognition that federal overreach had failed. Recall that when the U.S. Department of Education was established, it was charged by Congress to cprohibit federal control of education. > > That 9s a charge I embrace. And it 9s one I directed my team to take seriously as we continue to review your plans to ensure they comply with the law. Every plan that I sign is a commitment to that, and only that 4 the plan meets the requirements of the law. > > I didn 9t write the law. It 9s not a perfect law. But it 9s the law. > > I have refrained from expressing my opinion, thus far, out of respect for the process. But since we 9re all in this room together now, I couldn 9t pass up the opportunity to share some candid thoughts. Around my house, we call it ctough love. > > For too long, many of you have operated 4 and in many cases, been forced to operate 4 as if your work was only accountable to folks in my office. As if all that mattered in education was a sign-off from Washington. Or, perhaps worse yet, fear of what would happen if an aptly-described cbrutalist building in southwest D.C. didn 9t like your ideas. > > My predecessors, from both parties, often fell into the trap of a top-down approach, too often ignoring those who walk side-by-side with students every day. > > That 9s not to say I question their motives. Education is a unique issue in public life \\u2026 everyone agrees on the desired outcome. Everyone wants students to be prepared for successful careers and fulfilling lives. And the truth is: we need that to be the case. > > Except too many folks believe they should pursue that good end by centralizing federal power and wielding it aggressively. > > As a result, you were threatened with inquiries, audits and even fines if you didn 9t comply with the politics of the day in this town. > > I 9m committed to a different approach. > > We won 9t weaponize waivers to compel you to adopt this administration 9s politics. If we wanted to dictate from D.C., I 9d claim the mantle of our nation 9s cchoice chief and reject plans because they don 9t give parents more quality choices. But I haven 9t done that. And I won 9t. The department is not the national school board. > > This administration is committed to our nation 9s founding idea of separation of powers. The Department of Education doesn 9t write laws, it implements them. Congress did its job. We 9re doing ours. And now, you get to do yours. > > ESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs 4 including many in this room 4 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state 9s unique challenges. Well, this law gives you that chance. > > The trouble is \\u2026 I don 9t see much evidence that you 9ve yet seized it. > > At least not in the ESSA plans I 9ve thus far approved. Some have said that they didn 9t write their plans cto win an ESSA competition. Other plans look as though they were just written to get good grades from D.C. interest groups. Still other plans seem like they were written only for one purpose: compliance. > > Let me be clear: just because a plan complies with the law doesn 9t mean it does what 9s best for students. > > Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won 9t pass muster around kitchen tables. And I 9m not alone in this view. > > Some of your own governors 4 Republicans and Democrats 4 didn 9t like your plans either and refused to sign off on them. Some were vocal about it. > > One was disappointed his state 9s plan did cnot take full advantage of the opportunities for flexibility and innovation. > > Another warned his state 9s superintendent that cadding layers of bureaucratic paperwork does little to help low-performing schools. Still another governor lamented that his state 9s plan cstymies any attempt to hold schools accountable for student performance and includes provisions aimed at preserving the status quo in failing schools. > > And by the way, I agree. > > But what do these perspectives say to teachers in your state? What do they say to parents? What do these sentiments say to students? > > ESSA invites a different approach. > > Let 9s start with ESSA 9s cAnnual State Report Cards, one of the law 9s calls for transparency. Parents need to know 4 and have the right to know 4 what is and is not working about their children 9s schools. > > Some parents want to be equipped to make a different choice for their child, and others want to know where their child 9s current school needs to get better. > > Parents need information that is accessible, relevant and actionable. But too many parents who read their state 9s plan would have every right to think much is obfuscated \\u2026. as if their state doesn 9t want anyone to know how their students are really doing. > > Some states proposed accountability schemes that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one. Another state took a simple concept like a color-coded dashboard and managed to make it nearly indecipherable. > > We must do better for parents. For students. For our country. Louisiana, for example, uses an understandable A through F grading system with some pretty clear consequences for cF schools, including making other options available to parents whose children are assigned to those schools. > > We also should be able to clearly gauge the progress of all our nation 9s students. That, too, hasn 9t been a simple task over the years. Previous efforts focused on a goal 4 such as higher graduation rates 4 and if you didn 9t meet it, you 9d face the ire of cBig Ed. > > While that goal might have been laudable, we 9ve seen what happens. Just look at the ongoing scandal right here in our nation 9s capital, where school administrators fudged the rules and graduated kids who otherwise wouldn 9t have been eligible 4 all in response to top-down pressure. > > Under ESSA, states must measure students annually in reading and math, but the law invites you to determine the standards, determine the instruments and find solutions for the rest. > > Parents and teachers alike agree that education should move away from simply cteaching to the test. We all know we need new solutions. > > I 9ve heard many complaints about how inadequate current testing regimens are, but only four states have shown interest in applying for ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment Pilot 4 inspired by New Hampshire 9s performance-based assessment. > > The Granite State reduced standardized testing and enhanced locally- developed common performance assessments. They were designed to support deeper learning and to be more integrated into students 9 day-to-day work. > > Assessing the average assesses no one. Because there is no average student. > > New Hampshire 9s is but one new approach, but there are many other approaches that have yielded promising results for students. So, explore them! > > Title I, as you all know, was established to assist students who come from low-income families. These students need your creative thinking, but too many plans are short on creative solutions. > > cDirect Student Services is one vehicle you can use to better serve these students. You have the option to set aside up to three percent of Title I funds to provide students with learning opportunities that would otherwise not be available. We actually asked Congress to raise that to 5 percent in our 2019 budget proposal. > > But to date, only two states 4 New Mexico and Louisiana 4 have sought that flexibility. > > Louisiana will use its 3 percent 4 nearly 9 million dollars 4 to expand its course choice program, offering new options to students. I 9m encouraged that Louisiana is doing something, but ESSA encourages all states to use Title I funds creatively. Because today too many students are told cno. > > A student is bored in her math class and would be more challenged in an AP course? cSorry, we don 9t have AP here, the system says. > > A student wants to learn a skill like welding because she wants to work for the advanced manufacturer in town? cNope, the system tells the student, cwe don 9t have that available either. > > I 9m not comfortable with settling for those answers. I hope you aren 9t either. > > Course choice is but one way a state can embrace the law 9s flexibility in the interest of students. States could also use their 3 percent to incentivize enrollment in public schools of choice. > > ESSA also enables you to take an additional 7 percent of Title I funds and use them to empower local educators and districts to experiment with new approaches. For example in Nevada, 30 Clark County schools work together in what the state calls a cPartnership Network. The network teams with local leaders who have fresh perspectives. > > Nevada boasts this is not a cset it and forget it approach. Instead, they are constantly evaluating to ensure the funds are spent in the most productive way. > > Responsible use of taxpayer funds is important. That 9s why the law requires the public disclosure of how resources flow down to the school level. States like Georgia, Rhode Island and Colorado have already been doing so for years. And I applaud them for that. Next year, all states will need to show hard-working families how their money is being spent. > > But I 9d encourage you to go even further. Why not show how much money is being spent on each student and why? Is that different from the school down the street? And if so, why? > > The student-centered funding pilot takes us in that direction. This competitive grant enables money to follow children based on their needs 4 not buildings or systems. > > So as I 9ve pointed out, there are some bright spots among the plans. But even the best plan is short on the meaningful solutions that the law encourages. Even the best plan doesn 9t take full advantage of the law 9s built-in flexibility. > > And launching a PR push to defend these plans doesn 9t change that. It misses the point. > > Because our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. Or the cNCLB approach. Or the cRTTT approach. The cWashington knows best approach. > > So, don 9t you think it 9s time to do something different? To try something new that enhances student achievement? > > ESSA doesn 9t stand in your way. Our department won 9t stand in your way either. States are better equipped to find answers to their unique questions than Washington is. But states should always look for ways to\\xa0pass down flexibility and empower teachers and parents 4 those closest to students. > > Even though I 9ve not yet had the opportunity to approve California 9s plan, its governor was spot on when he said: cThis is not going to be solved in Sacramento. Kids learn at home and in the classroom \\u2026 People who really want to help in a school that is not performing should go to the principal and find out what they need. Local empowerment. That 9s what it 9s all about. The age of micromanagement from Washington or Sacramento is over as far as I am concerned. > > Governor Brown is right! > > Because the imperative to do something shouldn 9t have to come from Washington. It shouldn 9t have to come from your state capital. The imperative to do better comes from students. We are accountable to them! > > Better to try something new than to just hope for a better result. > > Because hope alone is not a strategy. Students don 9t have time to wait while adults hope plans will work. > > That 9s why your ESSA plans aren 9t a ceiling. There is no ceiling. There is no ceiling on what students can achieve. These plans merely establish the floor! > > ESSA plans are just words on a page. Let me put it this way: We don 9t evaluate football teams solely on who has the better game plan on paper. We evaluate them by what happens on the field! > > The real work of ESSA lies ahead. > > Because there is much work to be done. We must all do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st century and beyond. > > Students need learning environments that are agile, relevant and exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced and challenging lifelong learning journey. > > But when you picture most of today 9s classrooms, does the word cagile leap to mind? What about ccustomized d? cRelevant d? > > That 9s why we must pursue a paradigm shift \\u2026 a fundamental reorientation \\u2026 a rethink. > > I 9ve called for this nation to rethink school, and I want to make sure you 9re clear what I mean. > > cRethink means we question everything to ensure nothing limits a student from pursuing his or her passion, and achieving his or her potential. So each student is prepared at every turn for what comes next. > > Question everything. At every school. In support of every student 9s success. > > So I ask each of you: What are you going to do to rethink education in your state? > > What are you going to do to serve students in your state? Students! Not graduation rates, not a lobbyist 9s latest ranking, not a lawmaker 9s pet project \\u2026 no. > > These are our children we 9re talking about. These are their futures \\u2026 and ours. > > Right now a student is being bullied somewhere for only wanting to read, pay attention to the teacher and learn. Right now a student is being told he can 9t study a topic for his dream job because the school building doesn 9t have the teacher or the technology. Right now a student at school is stepping over rats, breathing in mold and dodging fists. These could be any of your students. All they want to do is learn. All their parents want is something better. > > And what will you say? What do your plans say? What will you do? > > Will you look into those students 9 eyes and settle for only what 9s required, nothing more? Will you sit across from that student stepping over rats and say, cBut our ESSA plan complied with the law! > > That child doesn 9t care about an ESSA plan. That student 9s parents don 9t care about my signature on your piece of paper. They care about what you do. > > We can act now. We must act now. > > Students 9 dreams, their hopes, their aspirations, their futures don 9t wait \\u2026 and neither can we. > > Our health, our economy, our continued security as a nation depends on what we do today for the leaders of tomorrow. > > We can do this.

        "article": " This dream is possible, but right now a lot of barriers stand in the way. We have a patchwork of state and local sex education policies and programs that vary widely across the country -- some leaning on abstinence-only instruction, reinforcing Weinstein-esque (or worse) gender norms(https://thinkprogress.org/this-is-how-we-are-spending-billions-on-the- sexual-mis-education-of-americas-youth-19a18439ce8f/), and lies about the efficacy of birth control. Too many young people are forced to resort to internet searches and rely on rumors for supposed information about sex and sexuality. What they end up finding can be dangerous and misleading. In this moment of reckoning about sexual assault and harassment, young people crave accurate information and want it on their own terms. An animated video created by a program I work with, AMAZE(https://amaze.org/) \\-- titled \"What is Sexual Assault(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8gslq85Xsc)?\" -- had its views spike above 100,000 after MeToo took hold in the media. There are some terrific resources out there to help parents, teachers and teens fill in the gaps, but they need additional resources to cut through a saturated media landscape. !The past, present and future of birth control in America(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !The past, present and future of birth control in America(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170915112147-this-is-sex-with-lisa- ling-control-large-169.jpg) !The past, present and future of birth control in America(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170915112147-this-is-sex-with-lisa- ling-control-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  The past, present and future of birth control in America Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH The past, present and future of birth control in America 15:44 Sex education that covers not just the birds and the bees but also teaches skills for establishing boundaries, consent and healthy relationships is key to dismantling a culture that allows sexual harassment and assault to persist throughout every industry, street and school in America. This isn't a pipe dream; it's becoming the reality in places like California(http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/readers- opinion/article183044641.html), where the recently enacted Healthy Youth Act requires comprehensive sex education in schools across the state, complete with factual and inclusive information about sex, consent, and healthy relationships. Unfortunately, this is not the sex education most of our children receive. Far too many students face abstinence-only curricula that shame anything other than strict heterosexuality and gender conformity. Studies show(http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\\(17\\)30260-4/fulltext) that abstinence-only programs don't delay sexual activity, but do give young people false and dangerous perceptions about sexual health and relationships. Just last year, an abstinence-only program was banned from a New York district after it compared a girl's virginity to chewing gum(http://www.syracuse.com/schools/index.ssf/2017/12/cny_parent_frustrated_with_sex_ed_lesson_that_compares_losing_virginity_to_chewe.html) and asked boys if they would want used gum. This common tactic used in abstinence-only programs spreads fear and stigma and fuels a harassment culture by promoting gender relations that devalue women and police their sexual activity. Now they're resurging under the Trump administration, which hired a crusader for rebranding(https://www.salon.com/2017/06/12/abstinence-only-rebranded- failed-right-wing-sex-ed-policy-returns-as-sexual-risk-avoidance/) abstinence- only with a euphemism: \"sexual risk avoidance(https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/06/23/euphemism-sexual-risk- avoidance/cowYjFTOcIS7hmD0wtm64O/story.html).\" But make no mistake; these are the same old ineffective programs masquerading under a benign name. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) While it may seem impossible to gain support at the federal level for high- quality sex education, we can make big changes closer to home. More states can follow the lead of California and implement policies that require comprehensive, inclusive sex education. Others can find courage in New York's example and challenge dangerous, misleading programs masquerading as sex ed. We can create a demand too big to be denied. Our country is at a crossroads, and our children are watching closely. During Tuesday night's address, they'll see that some of our national leaders are taking the MeToo conversation seriously. This conversation needs to happen at home, too. Now is the moment to make an impact on how young people approach interpersonal relationships for the rest of their lives. Let's not let them down.  ",

Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: \"It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all.\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the \"bureaucratic burden\" on teachers.     Funding 'tight' But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to \"answer the question\" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: \"I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic.\"  Image copyrightEPAImage caption Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy  In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a \"top priority\". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the \"biggest threats\" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years, recruitment targets for teaching have been missed(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42340798) and schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending \\xa3835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures.  Freeze on exam changes The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: \"With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. \"And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. \"Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn.\" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead.  Teacher 'burnout' Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained \"if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession\", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against \"entirely unnecessary\" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called \"mocksteds\". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. \"In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them.\" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: \"This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. \"If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.\"   ",

        "article": "  Global leaders converge every year in Davos, Switzerland, to talk shop about the world's most pressing problems: Poverty, technological change, global trade, sustainability and, lately, populism. Barri Rafferty, newly appointed global CEO of the PR firm Ketchum, spoke with CBS News about her top takeaways from this year's summit.\\xa0   1. Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence, or AI, \"was ubiquitous,\" Rafferty said. \"I don't think there was a session you could go into, whether it was health care or agriculture or technology that didn't talk about how AI is going to change our workforce.\"\\xa0 However, she added, there are certain human qualities AI can't replace, skills like creativity and empathy. Human workers can get a leg up on robots by highlighting the features machines don't have, she said. \"We need to teach people to question things; to be more creative; to be more insightful. Those are skills that are not memorization skills but tactics that we need to teach our children along the way.\"\\xa0  2\\. Blockchain technology \"The blockchain(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-safe-way-to-bet-on- blockchain-amid-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-craze/)\" became a buzzword about two years ago, coming onto the scene simultaneously with AI, Rafferty said. Blockchain is the ledger system behind digital currencies. But where AI has since been adopted by any number of industry sectors, blockchain is much less developed. \"Blockchain has not advanced as much, but because of cryptocurrency, there's so much interest in it.\" she said. \"There was a lot of debate -- are we able to crunch that kind of data? Do we have the power sources?\" \"There's a lot of infrastructure areas they're looking at to make it real,\" she said, \"but certainly the vision is there.\"  3\\. Concern about the oceans \"Sustainability and climate change continue to be a key theme,\" Rafferty said. \"You heard a lot this year about the oceans(https://www.cbsnews.com/news /ocean-pollution-united-nations-environmental-summit/)... people are very concerned about more plastics being in the ocean than fish,\" she said. \"There's a lot of concern about drilling and things that are going to happen in our oceans.\"     4\\. Women's issues have taken center stage When Rafferty first attended the meeting in Davos seven years ago, she was\\xa0frequently mistaken(https://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/31/are-you-a-spouse- no-im-a-ceocommentary.html)\\xa0for a spouse, she recalls. \"It was the fist time I felt like a minority.\" But, as concerns over women's equity have moved to center stage, she said, that's no longer the case. \"What started as a female issue became a business issue,\" Rafferty said. \"This year, female topics -- whether it was pay equity, equality -- really moved from the side room and what I call an 'HR topic' to being a C-suite topic.\"\\xa0 \"There were actually men by themselves talking\" about closing the gender gap, she noted.\\xa0 And the business case for promoting gender equality is clear, she added. \"When you have a more diverse slate of senior executives, and a more diverse board and business, you're going to be more profitable.\"\\xa0  5\\. The importance of reskilling \"Another theme that I saw this week was the concept of reskilling,\" Rafferty said. \"When you're 22 and you graduate, in our day, you thought you had everything.\" But, she said, \"our education system is first Industrial Revolution where we're fourth industrial revolution. With AI, with technology, with everything changing, there are jobs that are going to go away. We're going to have to reskill the workforce, whether you're at a big corporation, or in a factory. \"To do an overhaul of curriculum, and an overhaul with adults that are already working,\" Rafferty added, \"it's going to take what Davos proposes -- a lot of people working together, and a lot of collaboration, to get there.\"\\xa0   ",

Some of those affect public schools, as does actions taken by some state boards of education. A few states passed laws requiring public schools to offer free tampons and other feminine hygiene products in bathrooms. There were newly mandated subjects: Virginia became the first state to set mandatory computer science standards, while California passed a law requiring schools to offer students in grades 7-12 education and training on human trafficking identification and prevention(https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1227). Here are some of the new laws and board mandates that will affect public schools (and you can see many others on a long list of education topics at this database(http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/education-bill-tracking- database.aspx)): **CALIFORNIA:** Among new laws affecting public schools in the state are, according to this list (http://newsroom.ocde.us/new-2018-education-laws-include-ending-meal- shaming/)from the Orange County Department of Education: **Ending 8meal shaming 9** It 9s a little hard to believe this was happening in some school districts, but in some districts, schools would give a snack 4 or nothing 4 to students whose parents were not current in their school lunch payments. And some officials actually reprimanded kids while they were in line for lunch 4 or stamped their hands 4 so the kids could remind their parents to pay up. A new law bars what is called cmeal shaming. **Water testing at schools** All public schools are now required to test their water supplies for lead every year and let parents know if the water is considered not safe for drinking. A safe water source would then be found for students. **Human trafficking education** Students in grades 7-12 in public schools must be offered\\xa0education and training on human trafficking identification and prevention(https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1227). **Improving hygiene\\xa0** Some public schools must provide feminine hygiene products(https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10), including tampons, in at least half of the bathrooms on campus 4 and give them out free. The law covers schools with any combination of\\xa0 classes from grade 6 to grade 12, with at least 40 percent of the student population coming from low-income families. **FLORIDA** **Charter funding** Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed into law(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/31/its-hard-to-overstate-how-much-critics-hate- floridas-scam-education-bill-will-the-governor-veto- it/?utm_term=.445222aece70) education funding measures (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/06/15/florida- governor-is-signing-k-12-public-education-bill-that-critics-call-a-scam-at-a -catholic-school/?utm_term=.f752252421b9)that will, among other things, provide millions of dollars to help charter schools. Several school boards in the state have sued. ** 8Best and Brightest 9** The legislature voted to expand a highly controversial program called cFlorida 9s Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarships, which gives big bonuses to teachers with high student SAT and ACT scores (and strong evaluations). This is not about rewarding teachers whose students get high test scores but who themselves got high scores on these exams 4 even if it was decades ago. Some teachers who never took one of the college admissions tests\\xa0\\xa0 4 they may have started out in community colleges 4 are taking the tests now to qualify for the bonuses. **Textbook challenges** In what critics call an assault on science education(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/04/22 /what-the-latest-assaults-on-science-education-look- like/?utm_term=.1f9d9262b24d), a new law makes it easier for residents to object to the use of instructional materials in the public schools. Two obvious targets of the law: climate change and evolution. **KENTUCKY** **Student religious expression** A new law supporters say is aimed at protecting students 9 religious expression at school was passed after Gov. Matt Bevin (R) declared 2017 cThe Year of the Bible and in reaction to a move in 2015 by a school to remove a Bible verse spoken by the character Linus in a production of\\xa0 cA Charlie Brown Christmas. The law says it allows students to voluntarily express religious or political viewpoints in school assignments free from discrimination. It further requires that local boards of education make sure that the selection of student speakers is made in a viewpoint- neutral manner and that the student 9s prepared remarks are not altered before delivery without\\xa0 the student 9s consent. It also says that religious and political organizations are allowed equal access to public forums on the same basis as nonreligious and nonpolitical organizations, and that recognized student organizations 00 including religious ones 4 should not be c 8hindered \\u2026 against in the ordering of their own affairs, including the selection of leaders and members. Critics say the law gives school groups a legal right to discriminate against LGBTQ and other students. **\\xa0Bible literacy courses** A new law requires that Bible literacy courses be offered in public schools. The law says that the Kentucky Board of Education must set administrative regulations cto establish an elective social studies course on the Hebrew Scriptures, Old Testament of the Bible, the New Testament, or a combination of the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament of the Bible. It crequires that the course provide to students knowledge of biblical content, characters, poetry, and narratives that are prerequisites to understanding contemporary society and culture, including literature, art, music. **ILLINOIS** **School tax credit** The legislature approved a $75 million tax credit for people and companies donating to private school scholarships, a nod to school choice favored by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Donors can receive a credit worth 75 percent of a donation with a maximum of $1 million. **Feminine hygiene** In a move similar to the one in California, the Illinois legislature passed a new law requiring all schools to provide feminine hygiene products such as tampons and sanitary napkins free in bathrooms of schools with grades 6 through 12. The law says in part:(http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=100-0163) > Feminine hygiene products are a health care necessity and not an item that can be foregone or substituted easily.  > (2) Access to feminine hygiene products is a serious and ongoing need in this State.  > (3) When students do not have access to affordable feminine hygiene products, they may miss multiple days of school\\xa0 every month.  > (4) When students have access to quality feminine hygiene products, they are able to continue with their daily lives with minimal interruption. **MARYLAND** **Low-performing schools** The legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Larry Hogan (R) to pass a law limiting options for how school districts should deal with low-performing schools. It bans the use of charter school conversions, voucher programs, and the creation of a crecovery school district that oversees low-performing schools. **School security** The state 9s Center for School Safety is now authorized to make grants with public funds for specified security-related projects to schools and child care centers that are determined to be at risk of certain hate crimes or attacks. The schools can be public or private and can use the funding for additional security training needs, security personnel, security cameras, security-related technology, door-hardening, improved lightning, or other security-related upgrades. **TENNESSEE** **School buses** School bus drivers must now be at least 25 years old, a reaction to a 2016 school bus crash that killed six children that occurred when, police said, a 24-year-old driver was speeding while taking a call on his cellphone. The law sets other requirements for bus drivers 4 but doesn 9t require that new school buses have seat belts (a different approach than Texas, as you can see below). **TEXAS** **School buses** School districts buying new school buses must ensure that they are equipped with shoulder-to-lap seat belts, a reaction to a 2015 accident in which a school bus in Houston flew off a bypass and children died. **VIRGINIA** **Computer Science** Virginia became the first state to adopt mandatory standards for all districts in computer science, a year after. In November, the state Board of Education in Virginia approved the standards even though some members were concerned that they may be too ambitious. The Richmond Times- Dispatch(http://www.fredericksburg.com/news/education/virginia-will-require- computer-science-education-in-high-school/article_42ef33e1-1371-50f3-8d3e- 0505a847d704.html) quoted Anne Holton, the education secretary of Virginia, as saying: > cThe standards, they seem ambitious to me, These are not meant as aspirational standards, they are meant as a mandate that our teachers need to be able to teach. > > cWe 9re clearly leading the nation and that puts an extra burden on us to get it right.

(Tasos Katopodis/European Pressphoto Agency) The most significant revelation in a new Pew Research Center analysis(http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing- educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/) of partisan identification is the extent to which Democrats and Republicans no longer resemble one another demographically. Nearly 4 in 10 Democrats are nonwhite, while 83 percent of Republicans are white. Six in 10 Republicans are whites without a college degree; only a third of Democrats are. A third of Republicans are white evangelical Christians; a third of Democrats are religiously unaffiliated. Pew 9s data highlighted two consistent trends: Women are much more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans, while men are more split. White Americans (as was probably obvious from the paragraph above) are more likely to identify as Republican, and nonwhite Americans as Democrats 4 no group more so than black Americans. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t2cR2QV8FwgNeJkXr-jBoeOvNXc=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXEQPGP664YGJIW5P4TX6OGW64.png)  Understandably, the widening gap on education in Pew 9s data attracted a great deal of attention. College-educated Americans are much more likely to be Democrats than Republicans 4 and to an increasing extent. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hMLL-dWm5XIY8b_9Be4fDjZw8tw=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7W4PB4LX2E2PDBQMTMMW4SR5CU.png)  To some extent, this overlaps with age. Older Americans are less likely(https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf) to have college educations. Pew breaks out its age categories into generations, a subjective distinction(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/01/stop- wasting-your-life-worrying-about-what-generation-youre-in/) but one that makes it easier to talk about age groups. Americans born before 1946 are more likely to be Republican than Democrat by a nine-point margin. Boomers, the post-World War II generation, lean slightly Democratic. Generation X, slightly more so. And then there are millennials. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U3JzTtT5U5d-0rVvd_O4a8YR0_c=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EYKQL5ZCSQYP3NUTQV3FDQMAFI.png)  That gap between Republican and Democratic identification is generally seen as very bad news for Republicans. After all, millennials will be around a lot longer than people who were alive during World War II. Given that at no point have they preferred Republicans to Democrats, it suggests significant long- term problems for the GOP. One reason millennials lean more Democratic is that the group is also more racially diverse than older Americans. But the Democratic advantage among millennials exists even within groups that, overall, tend to identify as Republicans: men and whites. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EkKbbtIXOWnAmmqrpc2C4LFcRJM=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MIHSPX4L345H5NJN272OODZEZ4.png)  But that 9s a little misleading. Millennial men includes nonwhite men; white millennials includes women. If we isolate white, male millennials, the picture changes. Young white men identify as Republican. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HoM_dnajB888e4jKD3MjhcuoLIU=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E2KN6UELTE6Y3GKRW7ELXSONZE.png)  We 9ve seen this evidenced elsewhere. In January, PRRI and MTV released(https://www.prri.org/research/mtv-culture-and-religion/) a report looking at the political views of young Americans. That focused on the post- millennial generation, which is yet to be named. (MTV likes cFounders, which, hmm(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2015/12/03/mtv-wants-to-call-the-next-generation-the-founders-sorry- but-no/).) Many of the findings center on race:  * More than half of white men (and white women) in this age group believe that discrimination against whites is as significant as discrimination against other groups.  * Fewer than half of young white men say black people face a lot of discrimination.  * A quarter of young white men say white men face a lot of discrimination.  * Opinions of Barack Obama were much lower among young white men. More than half of white men in this group expressed a favorable opinion of President Trump.  * Half of young white men favor building the U.S.-Mexico border wall. There 9s an existing question(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2016/07/08/is-political-polarization-making-racial-tensions- worse/?utm_term=.21d60d9961b4) of the extent to which the increasing racial divide between the parties overlaps with increasing partisan animosity. Trump 9s election was clearly dependent to a large extent on issues that intersected with race. (In nearly every state, voters most worried about the economy preferred Hillary Clinton(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2016/12/02/in-nearly-every-swing-state-voters-preferred-hillary- clinton-on-the-economy/) in 2016 while those most worried about immigration or terrorism backed Trump.) The Republican candidate was successful after stoking racial fears; even before the election, most Americans thought Trump 9s rhetoric appealed to bigotry(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- fix/wp/2016/09/01/7-percent-of-donald-trump-supporters-think-hes- racist/?utm_term=.6eaf4a3dd2bb). The PRRI data suggests that this is not simply a function of older white Americans worried about the shifting demographics of the United States. The Pew data suggests that younger white men are more likely to support Trump 9s party than any other part of their generation. This survey still presents a worrisome future for the GOP as the nation grows less white and as millennials increasingly make up more of the electorate. (Per Pew 9s definitions, millennials and Gen Xers cast more votes(http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/31/millennials-and-gen- xers-outvoted-boomers-and-older-generations-in-2016-election/) in 2016 than older generations.) But the party 9s appeal to white men, a group that makes up a plurality of its membership, continues.  ",

A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has shed light on the suppression of freedom of expression and the undue influence of executive authorities and security services on the judiciary in the Emirati state.\\xa0  The 13-page report was prepared on January 5 and is expected to be presented at the 29th session of the Human Rights Council, which will run from January 15 to 26.  \"UAE authorities regularly subject those that violate their restrictions to torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and unfair trial procedures,\" the UK-based Emirate Centre for Human Rights, wrote(https://twitter.com/ECHRIGHTS/status/950760375875710977) on its Twitter page.   {articleGUID}   In its report, the UN body expressed regret over the UAE's failure to establish a national human rights institution in accordance with international standards.  The report argued that the justice system in the UAE is complex and impedes migrant workers and the stateless from bringing their grievances to justice.  On free speech, the UN body cited imprisonment and trials for people who had simply expressed their views or criticised institutions.  The commission also condemned arrests and forced disappearances outside the legal framework and the transfer of people to secret prisons under the pretext of being accused of \"terrorism\".  UAE authorities have used torture to force defendants to confess to the charges against them and deprive them of healthcare, the report said.   **Activists, women, migrants**  Prominent Emirati human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor(https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/letter-calls-uae-release- ahmed-mansoor-170627203939193.html) was detained in Abu Dhabi last year\\xa0and is accused of using social media to \"publish false information and rumours\" and \"promote sectarianism and hatred\".  Mansoor is being held in solitary confinement without access to a lawyer or calls to his family, according to human rights groups.\\xa0  OHCHR\\xa0called for the release of Mansoor, as well online activist Osama Najjar, Jordanian journalist Tayseer al-Najjar and academic Nasser bin Ghaith.  After the report's release, rights campaigners protested outside the UAE embassy in London last week to call for the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience.  \"ICFUAE calls upon the Emirati authorities to abide by its obligations under international law and safeguard the rights of those residing within its borders,\" said(https://twitter.com/ICFUAE/status/950356751324459008) the UK- based group International Campaign for Freedom in the United Arab Emirates, which organised the peaceful demonstration.\\xa0  >  > > Ahmed_Mansoor(https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ahmed_Mansoor?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw) has an unimpeachable record as a defender of rights and freedoms, and every day he remains in prison will constitute a black mark on the UAE(https://twitter.com/hashtag/UAE?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw)'s human rights recordFreeAhmed(https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeAhmed?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw) pic.twitter.com/04TAdw8gDi(https://t.co/04TAdw8gDi) > > \\r 4 Emirates Centre 4HR (@ECHRIGHTS) January 9, 2018(https://twitter.com/ECHRIGHTS/status/950690769945362432?ref_src=twsrc^tfw)  In its report, the UN body also pointed to the lack of transparency and independence of UAE's courts, where judges and prosecutors are often influenced by the executive authorities and state security officials.       ---   WATCH: UAE accused of abuse in secret Yemen prisons (2:00)(https://youtu.be/Sv2xibCjjUo)     In the case of women, the committee was concerned\\xa0that it was still possible for a husband to prohibit his wife from working and to limit her freedom of movement.  The OHCHR urged the UAE to immediately repeal that restriction and review other provisions that impeded women's free choice of profession and employment.  For migrant workers,\\xa0the organisation recognised progress was made with the labour law reforms aimed at abolishing the Kafala system.\\xa0  The work sponsorship system, known as Kafala in the Gulf, currently requires all foreign workers to obtain their employer's consent to travel abroad or switch jobs.  However, the UN regretted the abusive work practices, such as confiscating passports, false imprisonment, denied salaries and nonpayment of overtime, that migrant workers face in the country.\\xa0  The report warned that children continue to be trafficked into the UAE for sexual exploitation or forced begging and then deported without proper identification.\\xa0  ",

Another school day gets under way at Tarbolton Primary. The 193 pupils now occupy a brand new building replacing the loved but leaky old schoolhouse. They have been in the new premises for around a year, roughly the same amount of time the Scottish government's \\xa3120m Pupil Equity Funding (PEF) scheme has been in place.  * Schools share \\xa3120m in bid to close attainment gap(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-42866794) The scheme came from the desire of Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish government to close the poverty-related gap in educational achievement.    PEF aims to give children from poorer homes the same life chances as those in more affluent areas.   The actual cash allocation under the policy of \\xa31,200 per child is based on the number of children qualifying for free school meals. So Tarbolton Primary got \\xa372,000 in 2017/18, and will get a little more in 2018/19, about \\xa320,000 more than the national average. The policy manifests itself in different ways in different schools and here in South Ayrshire it is head teacher Jackie Blair who decides how to spend the cash.  Image caption Head teacher Jackie Blair says she knows what her school needs  She says that as a head teacher she knows her school inside out. \"You know where you want that money to go and you know where you think that money can make a big difference,\" she says. \"So to be able to work collegiately with your staff and make decisions locally is massive.\" Ms Blair is using the money to focus attention on the first three years of school, seeking to set solid foundations for the future.   One example is funding an early years practitioner to support class teachers. Ms Blair says that the school had always managed to raise pupil attainment but it could often take until the final year of primary to see the results. \"What we want to do is make that difference earlier because if we can do that, where might they be by the time they get to primary seven?\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption Education Secretary John Swinney said boosting schools was the government's \"defining mission\"  Teaching about the fish in the sea and some big words to go with them is Primary 1 teacher Jennifer Wallace who says the in-class back up from an early years practitioner makes a huge difference across the ability spectrum. Ms Wallace says: \"I think a lot of people have the perception that because all pupils are starting primary so they are all at the same level. \"That's absolutely not the case. \"It depends on home life, it depends on experiences in nursery and it depends on how engaged they are in learning.\" The primary one teacher says: \"We are able to reach all learners because you have got that extra pair of hands in class, which then further raises attainment.\"  Image copyrightThinkstock Running around in the playground is important to let off steam, but play itself has been identified as something PEF money can help with in terms of socialising, confidence and imagination. Early years practitioner Megan Hainey uses everyday objects like sticks and even cardboard boxes to help play and learning. Ms Hainey: \"The cardboard box can become a microwave one minute then it's a rocket. \"It's just about getting the children to use their imagination and they absolutely love it. \"We feel that's had a good impact when it comes to doing the imaginative writing.\" The notion of play and activity goes even further.  Image caption Deputy head Helen Ross says new ways of improving pupil confidence can be tried  Deputy head Helen Ross says using pupil equity funds to take 14 children, some as young as primary 2, who struggled to integrate into school life, on a four- day residential course had a big impact back in school. She says skills learned from activities such as abseiling fed right back into the classroom. Ms Ross says: \"They became very confident, responsible, working together very much as a team. \"That comes back into the classroom and the relationships they have with their peers when they are back in the class and the attitudes and relationships they have with adults in the school also.\" The first minister launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge three years ago in February 2015. The SNP hopes the policy will help reverse a sharp decline in Scottish education's international ratings, from organisations like PISA. But opponents such as the Scottish conservatives see the policy as a fig leaf covering up fundamental problems in areas such as teacher recruitment, retention and training, pointing out that the profession has 3,500 fewer teachers than when the SNP came to power almost 11 years ago. Head teacher Jackie Blair says: \"I personally haven't had an issue with staff recruitment. \"I think you have to recognise it is not having 100 teachers, it is having 50 particularly good teachers. \"I think that when you can give staff the resources the money and the autonomy to do what they can do best then that's when you are going to get the good results. \"I don't think it is just about filling the gaps with a body. \"It's about filling that gap with the correct person and using the money for training and resources to allow people to do the job they love is more important.\" Here at Tarbolton Primary staff say PEF has made a difference and is helping to close the attainment gap. They also seem to like the fact that in a profession full of prescription about what they have to do there is an area where they can decide for themselves. Whether other factors like teacher numbers and recruitment are an issue more widely is a matter for politicians to argue about. At the end of the school day the children head home happily oblivious to government policy. And that's probably just how it should be.   ",

          "article": " WASHINGTON 4 When Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began rolling back regulations to curb the predatory practices of for-profit colleges, critics seethed that the Trump administration was throwing yet another lifeline to a rapacious industry 4 in this case, one that sees vulnerable undergraduates as nothing more than moneymaking targets. , Henry N. Tisdale, the president of the small campus of Claflin University in Orangeburg, S.C., disagrees. , Since the Obama administration announced that it would establish a smoother pathway for students to claim that they had been misled by their colleges, Mr. Tisdale said he has feared an expensive legal battle over the smallest leaflet advertising a service on campus. ,  cA small mistake or error at a college like Claflin could put us out of business, Mr. Tisdale said. cWe don 9t have the resources ready to respond to frivolous claims. , Mr. Tisdale and his counterparts at other small, historically black colleges and universities are among an unlikely cohort of supporters for Ms. DeVos 9s effort to tighten a wide-ranging regulation that offers federal debt relief to students who were defrauded or deceived by their higher- education institutions. , While the rules targeted for-profit colleges with billion-dollar budgets, they apply to all institutions 4 including small, nonprofit colleges like Claflin that have been educating low-income, minority and first-generation students for more than a century without scandal. ,  cIt 9s a regulation that should be focused on the bad actors, and we have been lumped in when we 9re serving the students the bad actors are preying on, Mr. Tisdale said. cWe believe it should be improved to prevent unintended consequences. , Ms. DeVos 9s plans to overhaul the Obama-era rules for student borrowers reached a crucial stage this week, as a committee convened to renegotiate the regulations began debating the burden of proof students would have to meet to win claims against institutions. , The Education Department has proposed that students establish cclear and convincing evidence that institutions misled them, compared with a cpreponderance of evidence standard applied under the Obama administration. Students would also have to prove that institutions had an cintent to deceive, cknowledge of falsity and creckless disregard that resulted in financial harm to borrowers. , Officials in the department said during negotiations this week that they believed the current preponderance-of-evidence standard did not sufficiently protect taxpayers and institutions. , But Joseline Garcia, a negotiator on the panel and the president of the United States Student Association, said she believed the new standard swung too far in the opposite direction. , ** c** I think that switching to 8clear and convincing 9 does the opposite for students, Ms. Garcia said. cIt doesn 9t protect them at all. , She added: cAlthough the institution may have made an honest mistake, the harm is still the same for the student. And people 9s lives are greatly impacted by that harm. , Ms. DeVos has cast the Obama-era regulations as taxpayer-funded money grabs. In announcing the repeal of the rules, she said that institutions of all types raised concerns about cexcessively broad definitions of substantial misrepresentation and breach of contract, the lack of meaningful due process protections for institutions and 8financial triggers 9 under the new rules. , The United Negro College Fund, which has joined the chorus of criticism over the Trump administration 9s lack of tangible commitment to historically black colleges and universities, has long been among the most vocal opponents of the Obama-era rules. , Since the rules were announced in 2015, the college fund has expressed concern that they could threaten the viability of its 37 member institutions, which include Claflin, Spelman College, Morehouse College and Shaw University. The member institutions collectively educate 60,000 students on campuses of about 2,000 or fewer, and 75 percent of their students receive federal Pell grants. , The fund has said that the rules have a disproportionately negative effect on their member institutions because they have historically been underfinanced and serve vulnerable populations. , They fear having to spend thousands of dollars fighting claims instead of backing academic programming at institutions that have been graduating students who consistently post high success and satisfaction rates. (https://www.uncf.org/hbcu-impact) , Representatives at the United Negro College Fund are among the panelists hashing out the new standards and are in a unique position of having to represent both students and institutions. ,  cWe want to make sure this is a balanced process, said Lodriguez V. Murray, one of the college fund 9s members on the federal negotiating team. cWe 9re protecting students and the institutions that are giving them a chance to fall into the middle class. , Consumer rights and student advocates say the new standards essentially ask students who probably cannot afford to hire lawyers to become them. ,  cThe administration is effectively asking borrowers to have conducted a full investigation, with the power of discovery, that turns up some very severe findings from their institution before filing a borrower-defense claim, said Clare McCann, the deputy director for federal higher education policy at the New America Foundation. , Education Department officials on the rule-making committee said they could not outline how a student would meet the new burden of proof. But they said they believed, based on the claims that they have reviewed, that students could meet the standards if they were informed about them. , But others on the committee expressed concerns that the department had another goal. ,  cThis would effectively do away with borrowers 9 ability to get relief in almost all circumstances, said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center. , The department has struggled to complete a backlog of borrower-defense claims, the bulk of which were overwhelmingly against for-profit colleges(https://tcf.org/content/report/college-complaints-unmasked/), that began pouring in under the Obama administration and swelled to more than 100,000 in the last year. The department attributed the backlog, in part, to an insufficient system established under the Obama administration, which relieved students of $450 million in loan debt after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. , Ms. DeVos announced(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/politics/for- profit-universities-debt-relief-devos.html?_r=0) last month that her department would begin notifying more than 20,000 students whether their claims had been approved. Some would see only partial relief under the new system. , Lawyers who represent institutions on the negotiating team said that due process standards were crucial to their constituents because colleges could be held liable for some of the student debt ,  cWe all have bad actors. But in trying to get to the bad guys, are you allocating too much risk on the good guys? asked Aaron Lacey, a lawyer at Thompson Coburn L.L.P., which represents schools in regulatory litigation. , In addition to establishing a new burden of proof for student borrowers who feel defrauded, the department is relaxing financial accountability rules for institutions. Those so-called triggers would have required colleges to take a series of steps to demonstrate their financial health. , One such trigger that the United Negro College Fund opposed would have penalized schools if they had a high number of students defaulting on their loans. (Statistics show that the populations that black colleges serve tend to have higher default rates.(https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/17 /half-black-student-loan-borrowers-default-new-federal-data-show)) That trigger was stricken from the new proposed standards, while others that applied solely to for-profits remained but were made discretionary rather than required.

Primary school students at a school in the Chinese district of Shunqing were faced with this question on a paper: \"If a ship had 26 sheep and 10 goats onboard, how old is the ship's captain?\" The question appeared on a recent fifth-grade level paper, intended for children around 11 years old. Pictures of the question, along with students' valiant attempts at answers, surfaced this week on Chinese social media - where it triggered debate and quickly went viral. Education officials later said the question was not a mistake, but meant to highlight \"critical awareness\".     Image copyrightWeiboImage caption It is not clear how many points the question (circled) was worth or if it was part of a bonus section  \"The captain is at least 18 because he has to be an adult to drive the ship,\" one student answered. \"The captain is 36, because 26+10 is 36 and the captain wanted them to add up to his age,\" another guessed. One student however, simply gave up. \"The captain's age is... I don't know. I can't solve this.\"   * Chinese schools 'robbing young of individuality'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34605430)   * China's students take on dreaded Gaokao(/news/world-asia-china-36457453)   * 'In 1977 I took an exam that changed China'(/news/world-asia-china-42135342)   * Would Chinese-style education work on British kids?(/news/magazine-33735517)  Online, however, people weren't quite as generous. \"This question makes no logical sense at all. Does the teacher even know the answer?\" said one commenter on Weibo(http://s.weibo.com/weibo/%25E8%2588%25B9%25E9%2595%25BF?topnav=1&wvr=6&b=11517214525753), a Chinese microblogging platform. \"If a school had 26 teachers, 10 of which weren't thinking, how old is the principal?\" another asked. Some however, defended the school - which has not been named - saying the question promoted critical thinking. \"The whole point of it is to make the students think. It's done that,\" one person commented. \"This question forces children to explain their thinking and gives them space to be creative. We should have more questions like this,\" another said.  'Think outside the box' The Shunqing Education Department posted a statement on the 26 January(http://news.sina.com.cn/s/wh/2018-01-27/doc-ifyqzcxh0729685.shtml) saying the test had intended to \"examine... critical awareness and an ability to think independently\". \"Some surveys show that primary school students in our country lack a sense of critical awareness in regard to mathematics,\" it said. The traditional Chinese method of education heavily emphasises on note-taking and repetition, known as rote learning, which critics say hinders creative thinking. But the department said questions like the boat one \"enable students to challenge boundaries and think out of the box\". And of course, there's always that one person that has all the answers. \"The total weight of 26 sheep and 10 goat is 7,700kg, based on the average weight of each animal,\" said one Weibo commenter. \"In China, if you're driving a ship that has more than 5,000kg of cargo you need to have possessed a boat license for five years. The minimum age for getting a boat's license is 23, so he's at least 28.\"   ",

She was 70. The cause was complications from pneumonia, said her son Zach Cafritz. She had severe health problems in recent years, including back surgeries and a gallbladder operation that left her in a coma for more than a week. Ms. Cooper Cafritz came from a prosperous black business family in Mobile, Ala., but the family 9s standing in the community did not insulate them from indignities of the Jim Crow South. Galvanized by the civil rights movement, Ms. Cooper Cafritz arrived in Washington in 1964 to attend George Washington University, where she was determined to end the vestiges of racial segregation on campus. By her senior year, she had organized a black student union and helped force many fraternities and sororities to adopt race-blind charters. She also co- created a pilot workshop in creative arts in summer 1968 that she fostered into the Duke Ellington School of the Arts(http://www.ellingtonschool.org \"www.ellingtonschool.org\"). The school, modeled on New York City 9s High School of Performing Arts(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_of_Performing_Arts \"en.wikipedia.org\"), was a breakthrough for D.C. students gifted in dance, painting, music and theater but ill-suited to traditional schools.

(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Over five decades, Ms. Cooper Cafritz became a fixture of Washington 9s educational, cultural and charitable firmament, as much a socialite as a social activist as she married into and bitterly divorced out of the Cafritz real estate and philanthropic fortune. Her social orbit included Bill Clinton, Gloria Steinem, Quincy Jones, Vernon Jordan and Alma Powell, the wife of retired Gen. Colin L. Powell. She amassed one of the largest private collections(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002925.html?tid=a_inl \"www.washingtonpost.com\") of African American and African art, much of which was destroyed in 2009(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073004226.html \"www.washingtonpost.com\") by a fire at her hilltop mansion on Washington 9s tony Chain Bridge Road NW. Her estate became a salon where, with formal charm and brusque efficiency, she linked the policymakers, cultural leaders and real estate developers of official and unofficial Washington. She was a constant presence on the political fundraising circuit, and as an arts reviewer on  cAround Town, d(https://weta.org/tv/local/aroundtown \"weta.org\") a program on the Washington public TV station WETA. She also was chairman emeritus of the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities and a board member of arts institutions such as the Kennedy Center. She said her overarching mission was cto bridge the great divides among the city 9s factions in arts and politics. cThe majority of power in this city is black, and the majority of money is white, she told The Washington Post in 1979. cWe 9ve got to bring the two together. At some point in this society, everything has to converge. She took a personal step in that direction in 1981, when she married her longtime companion, Conrad Cafritz, a scion of one of Washington 9s wealthiest families. cI met him on the telephone, she once recalled to The Post. cHe called me to ask me for a reference for somebody. I said, 8That person is an expletive. 9 He said, 8That 9s an interesting response. Can we meet? 9  During their long courtship, they cut a striking profile as one of the few mixed-race couples in the city 9s elite. But the marriage rapidly grew troubled. Her lawyers claimed in divorce proceedings in the late 1990s that Conrad Cafritz creferred to their relationship as a 8European style 9 marriage, with each being free to have sexual relations with others as they desire, despite Mrs. Cafritz 9s wishes to the contrary. In his court filings, according to The Post, Conrad Cafritz disputed many of the allegations. After reaching a settlement, Ms. Cooper Cafritz retained the home, with its tennis and basketball courts and pool, as well as a secretary, cook, housekeeper and driver. The Post, citing a source familiar with her finances, wrote in 2002 that she received about $600,000 annually in child support, alimony and investment income.

In 2000, she vied successfully for the D.C. school board presidency, positioning herself as a revolutionary outsider. She was elected just as the federally appointed D.C. financial control board was returning control of the troubled school system to the school board. The school board was long a battleground, but many education officials told The Post that it became less effective and more polarized(https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/05/21/a-is- for-activist/bd2ce6fe-fdd7-4558-9af5-4727699eb0e0/?utm_term=.c78a8ba60913 \"www.washingtonpost.com\") during Ms. Cooper Cafritz 9s time as president. With a penchant for closed-door decision-making, she was perceived as aloof and authoritarian. She was unfiltered in her public remarks, decrying unqualified and incompetent teachers plaguing the school system. She also drew a link between feckless parenting and children with special needs. cThe reason we have so many special education students, she once said, cis you have children who have no father, and they go home to a mother who 9s on the couch eating potato chips and she pays no attention to the child, and he comes back to school and he wants attention, so he acts out. She provoked bewilderment(http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/05/whopper_of_the_week_peggy_cooper_cafritz.html \"www.slate.com\") by taking strong positions for and against school vouchers, which enable parents to use public money to send their children to private or parochial schools. Once, she claimed that a hacker penned an anti-voucher essay that appeared under her name, on her own website, before ultimately confessing that she had helped write it. To supporters, she was a dogged champion of accountability in an unwieldy bureaucracy that no one person could fix. To her detractors, she was a bully. She and members of the D.C. Council sniped at each other in meetings over matters petty and large, and she gradually lost the backing of then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D). By the time she declined to run for reelection, she was credited with doing little to advance the 55,000-student system, although she reached for her own checkbook to replenish school library shelves. As her tenure drew to an end, she personally took out a $40,000, full-page advertisement in The Post that trumpeted her service, noting an uptick in students going to college.  cThere are a lot of people who I can make scream when they hear my name, she told the newspaper in 2006. cI think a lot of people can 9t stand the fact that I 9m a rich lady on the hill. They think I couldn 9t possibly give a damn about the kids. They also don 9t appreciate the fact that I say what I think. Longtime political commentator Mark Plotkin called Ms. Cooper Cafritz ca controversial, provocative figure in a city that does not embrace bureaucratic mavericks.  cShe had many detractors, he said, cbut what cannot be taken away from her is the singular achievement of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. She was not a consensus builder or namby-pamby if she wanted to accomplish something. Nurturing young artists Pearl Alice Cooper, who later officially changed her name to Peggy, was born in Mobile on April\\xa07, 1947. Her parents owned a mortuary and life insurance business. When one of her older brothers was denied a place in an all-white Catholic high school, her parents decreed that their six children would be educated out of state at private schools. The financial strain eventually was a cause of her father 9s suicide, the family told reporters.  cMy father often said to me that he wanted me to be as comfortable sitting in a melon patch as I would be in an audience with the Queen of England, Ms. Cooper Cafritz once told The Post, cas comfortable reading Aquinas as I would be reading W.E.B. Du Bois. You are supposed to be wherever you are, he said. I never felt any fear about where I belonged. After graduating in 1964 from St. Mary 9s, a predominantly white Catholic boarding school in South Bend, Ind., Ms. Cooper Cafritz returned home and, along with friends, organized an effort to test the newly passed civil rights law outlawing racial discrimination in public facilities. She recalled being spat on by white youths at a drive-in. That fall, she entered GWU as one of the few blacks on campus, drawing media attention with her efforts to challenge de facto segregation. She rushed various sororities. That she cdidn 9t measure up Hellenistically, as The Post wryly expressed it at the time, came as no shock to her. As a founder of the Black Students Union, she pushed the student government and administration to demand that Greek organizations on campus prohibit discrimination or shutter. The measure passed in 1968. Although she graduated in 1968 and received her law degree in 1971, she said she had no intention of practicing law. The cEsq. after her name, she said, would cincrease my credibility and open a lot of doors. The origins of Duke Ellington reached back to 1968, when she staged a black arts festival and arranged for inner-city youths to be bused to campus to see exhibitions of black dance, art, music, literature and clothing. Meeting teenagers who were ctalented but very raw impelled her and a friend 4 director and choreographer Mike Malone(http://www.washingtonpost.com /wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/05/AR2006120501511.html \"www.washingtonpost.com\") 4 to create a summer arts workshop for high- schoolers. Ms. Cooper Cafritz saw creative promise in the most troubled of the lot.  cWhy does a kid get kicked out of school? she once asked a Post interviewer rhetorically. cBecause he 9s in trouble. And if you think about it, he 9s had to design the architecture of the trouble. Wow 4 he must really have something on the ball. **** Over the next several years, she almost single-handedly collected millions of dollars to help the program evolve into the Duke Ellington school, housed at the site of the former Western High School in Georgetown. She spoke of the Ellington school as a vital social juncture, commingling students of all races and economic backgrounds bound by a common devotion to the arts. The school, now highly competitive, underwent a major renovation that was completed in 2017 with $100\\xa0million in cost overruns. In the 1970s, amid her rising profile in the community, Ms. Cooper Cafritz became the youngest fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and served on a committee that created the University of the District of Columbia from two other academic institutions. She was a programming executive and documentary producer for WTOP-TV in Washington and an assistant to the president of Post-Newsweek Stations Inc. She also worked briefly with entertainer Harry Belafonte and M. Carl Holman(https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1988/08/11/m-carl-holman- dies-at-69/d7fb8c4a-f816-4df4-af1c-fe9aafa5a1df/ \"www.washingtonpost.com\"), president of the National Urban Coalition, in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a cminority cultural project for public television. In addition to raising three children, Ms. Cooper Cafritz became guardian and godmother to dozens of youngsters over the decades, often paying for their educations.

A devastating fire Artist Nekisha Durrett once described Ms. Cooper Cafritz 9s home as the cHermitage of African American art, referring to the world-renowned museum in St. Petersburg. The owner was staying with friends in Martha 9s Vineyard, Mass., when a fire one night in July\\xa02009 rapidly engulfed the property and destroyed more than 300 pieces of art, including works by Jacob Lawrence(https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/06/10/vivid- artist-jacob-lawrence-82-dies/ee586415-5ac6-4a5f-8fbb- e76781ad0495/?utm_term=.9692bfa3e3a8 \"www.washingtonpost.com\") and Romare Bearden(https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1988/03/14/romare- bearden-painter-and-collage-artist-dies-at-75/fa6e50ac-a6fc-4baa- 91f1-30c601b3e5b6/?utm_term=.226b0cf0d5b9 \"www.washingtonpost.com\"). City and federal investigators ****ruled the blaze accidental, attributing it to linseed-oil-soaked paper towels left in a plastic trash bag on her porch. Firefighters said inadequate water pressure from nearby hydrants stymied their efforts. Ms. Cooper Cafritz spent years suing the city 9s water authority, citing what she alleged was its failure to maintain neighborhood fire hydrants, and settled for an undisclosed amount in 2014. In 2011, she moved into a $3.25\\xa0million, 5,400-foot Dupont Circle condo that she had completely rebuilt(https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/six-years-after- the-fire-peggy-cooper-cafritz-has-a-new-home-and- collection/2015/09/22/22558aa2-518c-11e5-933e- 7d06c647a395_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.aa87de442e20 \"www.washingtonpost.com\") to showcase what remained of the art trove that she set about rebuilding.

Ms. Cooper Cafritz 9s expanded collection featured a Marshall drawing of an imposing woman.  cThe woman is a powerful image, she told The Post. cIt 9s an innate power as opposed to a position of power, and it 9s something I think all women have the right to possess.

One said her line manager told her \"the BBC doesn't do equal pay\". The evidence was submitted ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary select committee hearing about the gender pay gap at the BBC. There, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee heard from the BBC's director general Tony Hall. Carrie Gracie, who recently resigned as the BBC's China editor over pay disparity, also appeared.    Most women who gave written evidence, via the BBC Women group, did not wish to give their names out of concern for their careers at the corporation. Here are the women's stories in full:  1\\. TV news presenter \"In 2017 just before the BBC published pay over \\xa3150,000, I was called unexpectedly offered an immediate pay rise. It became apparent that for nearly three years I had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more. As we are both BBC staff that means I have not just missed out on pay, but on pension contributions too. I am told that we are now being paid at the same rate per day, but there is no transparency.\"  2\\. Former BBC Scotland health correspondent Eleanor Bradford \"I was BBC Scotland's health correspondent from 2001 to 2016. I discovered I was one of the lowest paid correspondents at BBC Scotland, despite regularly appearing on UK-wide news and delivering exclusive stories. I regularly asked for a pay rise, and eventually cited equal pay legislation. This led to an immediate increase of \\xa35,000 but it was not backdated. I remained around \\xa310,000 below some male colleagues who were doing identical correspondent jobs. In one of my annual appraisals I was told I was a 'model correspondent'. I left the BBC.\"  3\\. National radio presenter \"I am an award-winning broadcaster with more than 20 years' experience. In 2014, I was offered a contract to present a flagship arts programme. Two men with no broadcasting experience who had also been given trial shifts presenting the programme during the search for a new presenter were paid 25% more per programme. Then I found out that the existing male presenter was being paid 50% more than me per programme. When I asked for the pay gap to be corrected the line manager told me 'the BBC doesn't do equal pay', and that in raising the issue I was being 'aggressive'. I refused to back down and eventually was given the same rate as my male colleague and it was backdated.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption Auditors PwC published a report on BBC pay on Tuesday  4\\. Reporter \"My full-time equivalent salary for making identical programmes is about half my male counterpart's. I challenged my grade and asked for an equal pay review. The BBC took months to deal with my enquiry and refused to recognise that it was a claim for my legal right to equal pay for equivalent work. Eventually I was offered a series of increases adding up to a total of between 20-25%, with minimal back pay, which I felt I had no option but to accept because of the stress involved. It has brought me nowhere close to the salary of my male colleague. He also gets extra resources for his programmes, at the expense of others. I don't resent my male colleague. He is talented and deserves it. But we need parity of pay, resources and opportunity.\"  5\\. National broadcaster \"Since July I have been offered a 65% pay rise, whilst also being told that the BBC is 'satisfied there was no issue of equal pay' in my case. In pay terms this offer would bring me in line with the lowest paid of the presenters who work on the same programme as I do. That is despite my longer service on that programme. In contractual terms I am still disadvantaged as, unlike fellow presenters, I am not on full staff so have not benefited from pension rights accrued over many years.\"  6\\. News programme presenter \"When I was appointed to my current job in October 2013, there followed six months of negotiations over my salary. It was eventually set at \\xa353,600 for three days per week. In absolute terms I am well paid and I recognise and appreciate this. However, at the time this sum was agreed, I had no idea of how my pay compared to that of my fellow presenters. On publication of the 'talent list' in July 2017, I learnt that I am paid hundreds of thousands less than some of my colleagues. I am also paid \\xa345,000 less than my immediate male predecessor. No-one has explained to me how such a discrepancy can be justified.\"  7\\. Sports broadcaster \"I have worked for the BBC for almost 30 years, both staff and freelance. I present major sports coverage on national radio. In 2017 my contract was worth \\xa319,000 for 50 days, reporting and presenting. This is an average day rate of \\xa3380. When I present one of the flagship radio sports programmes I am paid \\xa3500. I have been told the male presenter is paid \\xa31,200. Since raising the issue of equal pay I have been offered \\xa3650 which is still a long way short of equal pay. What you are worth is solely at the whim of management who essentially in sport are always men. I'm at the top of my game, knowledgeable and with three decades of experience, yet I'm scratching around to earn a living.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption The BBC's director general Tony Hall will address the select committee on Wednesday  8\\. UK-based on-air editor \"In 2017 I discovered one of the male UK-based editors reporting for the same flagship programmes is paid between 50% and 100% more. Since then it has become apparent other male on-air editors making equivalent news pieces, for the same news programmes, are also paid significantly more. The BBC has refused to accept there is an equal pay issue, but offered me an on-the-spot 10% increase. I have not accepted as it does not resolve the wider issue around pay inequality.\"  9\\. Nations and regions presenter \"I have co-presented with a male colleague for many years. Despite working fewer hours than me, he earns more. Pro-rata, I estimate he's paid around double what I earn for doing the same job. Both colleagues and the public would consider us equals. I raised the equal pay issue many times over the years, but nothing was done.\"  10\\. Sport editor \"I lead a sports team in a big city with Premier League teams in our patch. There are few women in equivalent jobs, none in a big city. I believe I have been paid less than my male counterparts across the UK for most of the time I have been doing this job. Four men doing the same job have confirmed their salary is higher by up to \\xa310,000. I have no confidence in the BBC review process. I tried asking for equal pay in 2017 and recently heard it is still under review.\"  11\\. Radio 4 reporter \"In 2017 I submitted an equal pay claim after finding out that a male colleague was being paid \\xa37,000 more for doing the same job. I made little progress, so I began a formal grievance. A few days before the hearing I was called in and offered \\xa34,500 extra a year. I was told it was not because they thought I had an equal pay claim, but a reward for hard work. I am considering further action as they refuse to backdate my pay.\"  12\\. National radio presenter \"I have worked alongside my male co-host for six years so far and for all that time have been paid at one third of the rate he is paid. We work broadly the same hours with equal production input into the programme. Pay query raised in autumn 2016, only to be told there was no issue. Pay revised July 2017. Case still subject to negotiation and part of NUJ collective grievance.\"  13\\. National radio presenter \"I used to present a breakfast news programme in BBC local radio. In 2013, Tony Hall set a target to increase the number of women presenting in local stations. Shortly afterwards I was told my job was at risk and then that I could stay, but only on half my previous salary. It was also half of the amount being paid to my then male co-presenter. As the sole breadwinner I eventually had no choice but to leave. I now present on BBC national radio and earn what I believe is less than half of my current male co-presenter's salary for the demanding show we both present.\"  14\\. Presenter regional news \"I am one of two main presenters on a regional TV news programme. I have the same role as my male colleague, contracted to the same number of hours and days per year. I am often called upon to present more demanding programmes, such as election debates, in preference to my male colleague. I have 28 years experience as a journalist. In 2012 I became aware of my male colleague's salary, which was a third more than the figure I had been offered. Despite assurances of a comprehensive pay review, none was forthcoming. There was a point blank refusal to a request for equal pay. Eventually I was given a 5% increase in 2017. I can't see any justification for the pay gap which remains.\" * * *  _Follow us on_Facebook(https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/) _, on Twitter_@BBCNewsEnts(https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts) _, or on Instagram at_bbcnewsents(https://www.instagram.com/BBCNewsEnts/) _.

Women make up the majority of parliament in this African country.  By most measures, Rwanda is Africa's gender-equality success story for high female representation in politics, education and the workplace.  Rwanda was the first country in the world to have more than half of its government run by women.  Currently, 64 percent of its parliament is female, and it has been ranked the highest country in the world with most women in parliament, as of January 2017.  Jessica Horn, director of programmes, African Women's Development Fund in Ghana(https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ghana.html), says: \"There is a legacy of African women playing significant roles in political leadership, and so it should not be too much of a surprise to see women playing political roles in Rwanda.   !(/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/50848420d5ad44eb989dc7bcb9146048_18.jpg)  ---  Memory Pamella Kadau:\\xa0Rwanda sets an example for Africa and the world in terms of women's political participation process     \"It's the number that is significant - and that is the result of mobilising.  \"African feminists have always argued, though, that it is not just quantity - the number of women in parliament - but politics: whether they work for a women's rights and transformative agenda.\"  Horn says, \"On that point, every African parliament needs work. We still don't have full, consistent commitment to prioritising and financing gender equality anywhere. That's why we remain advocates\".  According to the Global Competitiveness Report(https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness- report-2017-2018), Rwanda is the best place to be a woman in Africa(https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html) and fourth globally after Iceland(https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Iceland.html), Norway and Finland.   !(/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/b56c6fdb486a41f3bb7b05fa68704831_18.jpg)  ---  Ngozi Cole: My hope is to keep continuing to fight for more progress in terms of political participation and more laws that empower women     Rwanda is also a global leader in commitments related to the HeforShe campaign, the global solidarity movement for gender equality, developed by UN(https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html) women and spearheaded by men in support of justice and equality for women.  But just because Rwanda has a female-majority government, does not mean women are better off.  According to the UN, rates of domestic violence are considered high in the country.  Al Jazeera talked to several women across the continent about how Rwanda sets an example for other African countries.   !(/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/3/9/6b10ea9c6f8f40a5834d723fc539f2e1_18.jpg)  ---  Jessica Horn: We still don't have full, consistent commitment to prioritising and financing gender equality anywhere     Duduzile Nyirongo, a feminist who celebrated International Women's Day in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, on Thursday, told Al Jazeera that Rwanda is an example of gender inclusivity.

The policy has angered religious groups from many faiths as well as drawn ire from American conservatives. Canada Summer Jobs grant applicants must check a box on their forms stating they support human rights, including \"reproductive rights\". Mr Trudeau has dismissed the backlash as a \"kerfuffle\".  What is the controversial policy? A new clause in the grant application for the Canada Summer Jobs programme and the Youth Service Corps demands that applicants check a box that says:    \"My organisation's core mandate respect individual human rights in Canada\\u2026 these include reproductive rights and the rights to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, colour, mental or physical disability or sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.\" The jobs programme funds some 70,000 summer jobs for youths between the ages of 15-30. The clause was added after the government was forced to pay a court settlement to three anti-abortion groups after it denied them funding in 2017.  Is it a surprise? Mr Trudeau has made it no secret that he adamantly supports reproductive rights. When he first became leader of the Liberal Party in 2014, he banned anti- abortion candidates from running for office and insisted that all party members vote in favour of pro-choice.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Former White House staffer Sebastian Gorka is critical of the policy  \"Of course, you're more than allowed to have whatever beliefs you like,\" Mr Trudeau said during a town hall in Hamilton, Ontario last week. \"But when those beliefs lead to actions determined to restrict a woman's right to control her own body, that's where I, and I think we, draw the line as a country. And that's where we stand on that.\"  How has it been received in Canada? Pro-choice groups have applauded the decision, but many religious organisations and anti-abortion groups are outraged. The Toronto Right to Life Association has already filed suit alleging discrimination, (https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/05/anti- abortion-group-takes-trudeau-government-to-court.html)just months after the government settled with the group for also denying them funding last year. Other religious groups who do not actively campaign against abortion have expressed concern that the policy penalises people for their beliefs. \"It requires an evaluation of employers based not on what they're going to do, but who they are and what they believe,\" says Ray Pennings, the executive vice president for the non-partisan Christian think-tank Cardus.  Why is it making waves in the US? The policy was debated on Fox News' morning programme Fox and Friends, while former White House staffer Sebastian Gorka called Mr Trudeau \"reprehensible\" on Twitter(https://twitter.com/SebGorka/status/952266075072327681). On Fox and Friends, Jeanne Mancini, who organises the March for Life, said Mr Trudeau was \"out of touch with mainstream America\". \"We've lost over 60 million Americans to abortion. To the prime minister, I would just really want to talk to him,\" she said. But it is not the first time Mr Trudeau has run afoul of US conservatives. In 2017, US President Donald Trump cut funding for groups that provide abortion services, prompting Mr Trudeau to pledge (http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/ca9d6cd3-5c3c-469a-bb35-9a957f0ca5b9) $523m (C$650m; \\xa3376million) towards sex education and reproductive health initiatives around the world on International Women's Day.

          "article": " For a year now, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been trying to give away her $199,700 salary. , With every government-issued paycheck, which she pledged she would not take, the billionaire cabinet secretary grew more frustrated by ethics rules that restricted her ability to donate to charities in her official capacity. , But this week, after finally getting the go-ahead to donate in her personal capacity, she was able to call four organizations of her choosing to inform them they would evenly split the money: Kids Hope USA, a faith-based organization that connects mentors with schools that Ms. DeVos was long affiliated with, including as a mentor(https://www.thisamericanlife.org/624 /private-geography/act-one); the Special Olympics, the global sports organization for people with intellectual disabilities; Vision to Learn, a program that provides free eye exams and eyeglasses to students in low-income communities; and Dreams Soar, which supports girls in aviation and science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. , For Ms. DeVos, the protracted effort to give her money away is illustrative of her first year in government: She struggles with bureaucracy. She has met opposition at every turn, but in a wide-ranging interview this week to mark the end of her first year as secretary, she said her agenda had not been derailed. , Ms. DeVos, a philanthropist and longtime supporter of private, parochial and public charter schools, remains unapologetic about the things that have made her a target of criticism. She still believes in parents 9 right to choose alternatives to neighborhood public schools, with publicly funded tuition vouchers if need be. She still believes the federal government should have a limited role in telling any school how to educate its students. , And she believes that what many thought disqualified her for the job 4 her lack of experience with public neighborhood schools, which educate the majority of the nation 9s students 4 has been an asset. ,  cI don 9t know what can 9t be done, Ms. DeVos said. cAnd I come in with fresh eyes around all of these issues, and I think that questioning the way things have been done, and being able to look at things from a different perspective, is a good thing. , Here are five takeaways from a question-and-answer session Ms. DeVos conducted with a group of reporters about her first year in office. , **1\\. She has not given up on expanding school choice.** , Ms. DeVos has reeled in her rhetoric around a national voucher and charter- school initiative, and in recent speeches she has emphasized crethinking the way schools educate students across the board. ,  cI would say it 9s a broadening of the message, Ms. DeVos said. cWhen we talk about the need for innovation in education, it has to happen in every traditional school, it has to happen in every private school, it has to happen in every charter school. , Ms. DeVos called the expansion of 529 plans in the December tax law to cover K-12 expenses a cbig win for private and parochial school choice but agreed with analysts who said that the legislation was limited in its impact, especially for low-income students from families with limited means to save. , She signaled that she had settled for using her platform to champion the cause. ,  cThere hasn 9t been a secretary that has talked about empowering parents and giving them choices before, Ms. DeVos said. cAnd I think that 9s a huge benefit, and frankly a privilege to do 4 to try to be a voice for many parents who don 9t have voices. , **2\\. She is proud and pained by regulatory rollbacks.** , Ms. DeVos said she believed that reducing the department 9s footprint had been csome of the most important work we 9ve done in this first year. But she said that the most significant rollback thus far 4 Title IX guidance issued under President Barack Obama for investigating sexual assaults on campus 4 had been cprobably one of the most heartbreaking parts of this job. ,  cAs a mom and a grandma, I think about my children, and we need to get this right. We need to get it right for all students, and it clearly hasn 9t worked in far too many cases, she said. , Victims and advocates have said that Ms. DeVos 9s rescission of the campus sexual assault guidance, which she replaced with interim guidance that changed the standard of proof for investigations, has had a chilling effect on victims who are reluctant to report assaults. ,  cThat would certainly be the last thing I would desire or want, she said. cI don 9t think that the interim guidance that we provided ultimately does that in any way. , Ms. DeVos said the department was still examining the Obama-era guidance that addressed the disproportionate impact of discipline policies and special education placements on minority students. Civil rights organizations have pointed to Ms. DeVos 9s re-examination of these policies as evidence of her lack of empathy for vulnerable populations. ,  cIt 9s hurtful to me when I 9m criticized for not upholding the rights of students, she said. cFor not caring about students with special needs. Nothing could be further from the truth. , Ms. DeVos remains hard pressed to find an area where she thinks regulation is appropriate, but she identified enforcing civil rights laws and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act as a critical role for the department. , **3\\. She believes she is implementing the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, with fidelity.** , Ms. DeVos has faced criticism over her department 9s approval of state plans for implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington who was a chief architect of the law, said that Ms. DeVos had approved plans that do not account for the achievement of low- performing students, as the law requires. ,  cI 9m only approving plans that comport with the law, Ms. DeVos said. cAnd I 9m encouraging anyone who has been critical of me and/or the department on approval of plans. , Ms. DeVos declined to comment on the quality of specific state plans. ,  cI think, very honestly, there 9s lots of areas for continued improvement and a plan is nothing but a bunch of words on paper, she said. , **4\\. She feels hamstrung by Congress.** , Ms. DeVos 9s frustrations these days are directed at the body that confirmed her only with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. , She said a major source of frustration had been the unfilled positions in her department. Five nominees await Senate confirmation, including her would-be deputy and the nominee to (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics /kenneth-marcus-civil-rights-israel-bds.html)head the department 9s office for civil rights(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics /kenneth-marcus-civil-rights-israel-bds.html). ,  cWe have many qualified, capable individuals waiting to come and contribute here and they 9re just messing around up on that building on the hill, Ms. DeVos said. , Ms. DeVos also expressed frustration with how much Congress controls the budget, which she said was an example of chow Washington doesn 9t work. It is also in the Constitution. ,  cIf we were given a top-line number and were able to designate by our own priorities around line items, it would probably look somewhat different than what the budget looks like, Ms. DeVos said. , **5\\. She plans to push experiential and personalized learning in K-12 and higher education this year.** , Ms. DeVos has already begun stumping for initiatives that would give students different pathways to the work force, a mission President Trump has thrown his weight behind in calling for more  cvocational schools(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-vocational- education.html). , Ms. DeVos said too many students were being steered toward a traditional college degree. , \"I think personalized learning, competency, mastery, that 9s a big shift from where education has been, she said. cBut it 9s absolutely where most of education has to go.

Along with its snub-nosed revolvers and 9 mm pistols, Springfield-based Smith & Wesson makes the popular AR-15-style assault rifles -- including the very weapon used to murder 17 students and teachers at Parkland, Florida 9s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJKoHmlFXsqw/v1/60x-1.jpg) Workers inspect hot metal forgings on the production line.

But he likes to shift the subject to a planned MGM Resorts International(/quote/MGM:US \"Company Overview\") casino, which will become the city 9s biggest employer. Smith & Wesson has slashed its manufacturing workforce by a quarter over the past year. It now employs 1,000 or so, according to Kennedy.

The company, now officially called American Outdoor Brands (/quote/AOBC:US \"Company Overview\")Corp., declined to comment.  Cold Shoulder This cold shoulder bothers gun enthusiasts in Springfield, 90 miles west of Boston and 140 miles north of New York City. Just outside the city limits, Walter Lamon sells guns at Culverine Firearms, where photos of soldiers adorn a store packed with boxes of Smith & Wesson revolvers. His business, like Smith & Wesson 9s, boomed under President Barack Obama because of fears of gun confiscation and fell under National Rifle Association booster Donald Trump(https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1252249 \"Billionaire Profile\") (Shares of American Outdoor Brands have lost almost two-thirds of their value since the 2016 presidential election.)\\xa0 Lamon, 70, loathes Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat who tightened the state 9s assault weapons ban. A photo of Healey, with a hand-drawn Hitler mustache, hangs on a wall. cHeil Healey, it reads. In Massachusetts cthe gun industry and people like me are vilified, Lamon said. cThat 9s because the majority of folks have a more liberal bent.  Awkward Dates For almost a decade, David Upton, 34, managed orders for Smith & Wesson. Even in romance, he experienced the gun divide. When he was dating, some women recoiled in horror at his employer, while others would ask if he could take them shooting.  cThe joke when I was there is that we can 9t sell 90 percent of the guns we make to people who live in the state, he said. Upton, who now works at a craft brewer, said his old job has since moved to gun-friendly Missouri. In fact, Massachusetts may be losing its status as a gun leader, as manufacturers ship operations to the South and Southwest, according to Jurgen Brauer, Small Arms Analytics 9 chief economist.  cIncreasingly, these kinds of companies feel they 9re in a little bit of a foreign land culturally, Brauer said. Employees bristle at being cconstantly affronted by anti-gun sentiment when they go to church or the grocery store.  War Laboratory Springfield 9s firearms focus dates to the Revolutionary War, when George Washington selected the city for the nation 9s first armory, which functioned as a U.S. Army gun factory for almost two centuries. There, inventors transformed the muzzle-loading rifle of the Civil War era into modern breech-loading weapons and then World War II 9s signature M1 Garand rifle. For the Vietnam War, the armory was the site of testing for the M16 rifle, the military version of the AR-15. A half mile away, the Springfield Museums offer visitors the Smith & Wesson Gallery of Firearms History(https://springfieldmuseums.org/about/museum-of- springfield-history/smith-wesson-gallery-of-firearms-history/ \"Gallery Details\"). Sponsored by the company, it features 1890s pistols engraved by Tiffany jewelers and a prized nickel-plated. .357 magnum.  cFOR MECHANICAL SKILL, STRENGTH, ACCURACY AND PENETRATION THEY ARE UNEXCELLED, reads an early Smith & Wesson add featuring a man in a cowboy hat and handle-bar mustache.  Dr. Seuss But\\xa0Karen Fisk, the museum 9s marketing director, says few tourists visit that gallery; they flock instead to the new museum honoring Springfield native and author Dr. Seuss. Bud Williams, a former school teacher and probation officer, focuses less on the history of guns and more on their impact today. As a state representative, his district includes Smith & Wesson. More often than he likes, he finds himself comforting the families of gunshot victims in a city whose violent crime rate rivals Chicago 9s. (Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, donates to groups supporting gun control, including Everytown for Gun Safety.) !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iyI7Tg4L0rEI/v1/60x-1.jpg) One of several buildings of what 9s left of the Springfield Armory.

To take guns off the streets, Williams, a Democrat, is planning a buyback program. In 2013 and 2016, such efforts netted hundreds of guns that were later destroyed -- though a handful of the most valuable are stored at Springfield 9s famed armory, now a museum run by the National Park Service. In other words, Springfield celebrates, manufactures, sells -- and destroys -- guns.   ",

        "article": "   Last Updated Mar 27, 2018 11:27 AM EDT   Of the issues that divide Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and President Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser, John Bolton,(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-john-bolton-the-new-national- security-adviser/) one stands out: North Korea. Bolton, who will replace Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on April 9, has publicly advocated for overthrowing the North Korean government. Mattis, a retired Marine general who knows intimately the costs of war, favors diplomacy to rid the North of its nuclear weapons and has said war on the Korean peninsula would be \"catastrophic.\" On Iran, too, Mattis would seem at odds with Bolton, who has argued for abandoning the Obama-era nuclear deal.(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jimmy-carter-trump-john-bolton-national- security-adviser-worst-mistake/) These and other matters of war and peace will test Mattis' influence with Mr. Trump as his national security team is overhauled. On Thursday, Mattis told reporters that while he had not yet met Bolton, he was confident in a \"partnership\" developing between the two men.\\xa0 \"He's going to come over this week.\\xa0 Last time I checked he's an American. I can work with an American...It's going to be a partnership,\" Mattis said.\\xa0 Mattis was sometimes at odds with McMaster, but the arrival of the hawkish Bolton, combined with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the uncertain status of John Kelly as White House chief of staff, appears to leave Mattis more isolated than at any time since he took over the Pentagon 15 months ago. Often described as a steadying or moderating influence on the impulsive Mr. Trump, Mattis has little previous relationship with Bolton. The North Korea issue is front-and-center: Mr. Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean President Kim Jong Un by May to discuss the North's nuclear disarmament. The unprecedented summit could be a turning point in a decades- old U.S.-North Korean standoff that Mr. Trump himself has said could end in \"fire and fury\" - an American nuclear attack __ to stop the North from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile. \"This is buckle-up time,\" retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said last week on MSNBC. \"For the military I have three words: Sharpen your swords. He (Bolton) is someone who is going to reach for the military instrument.\" The changes in the White House and at the State Department, while significant for Mattis, are hardly heart-stopping. People close to him sense no change in his commitment to the job; some suggest that Mr. Trump's decision to move former Republican congressman and current CIA director Mike Pompeo to State, replacing Tillerson, could benefit Mattis in the sense that he'll have a partner at State who is better aligned with Mr. Trump. Publicly, Mattis has said little about the shakeup. He was in Afghanistan when Tillerson got the ax. When reporters asked his reaction a couple of days later, Mattis said he preferred not to comment on the details, although he went on to suggest that its importance was being exaggerated. He said that in all of his discussions abroad with foreign government officials and American troops, the matter was not brought up once. \"I understand why you're asking, but I'm just pointing out that in most parts of the world this is a Washington, D.C. story,\" he said. Another Washington story is Mattis and his ability to forge a workable relationship with Mr. Trump despite differences on some issues like the Iran nuclear deal, which Mattis says is flawed but worth honoring as long as the Iranians do. Mattis also has differed with the president over Mr. Trump's wish to bar all transgender people from serving in the military, and he helped sway Mr. Trump from his inclination last year to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan.(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-james-mattis-we-are- not-quitting-this-fight/) The Mattis formula seems to be simple. Out of the spotlight, out of trouble. The less he says publicly, the less he risks losing influence with Mr. Trump. \"Part of his success ... is absolutely the fact that you don't see him in the limelight terribly much,\" says Loren Dejonge Schulman, a defense analyst at the Center for a New American Security who served in key national security positions in the White House and Pentagon under President Barack Obama. \"That may be keeping him out of trouble with the White House but I think it's setting an incredibly bad precedent in terms of Pentagon transparency.\" If Mattis, who spent more than 40 years in uniform and is the first career military officer to lead the Pentagon since George C. Marshall in the early 1950s, isn't the most experienced politician to run the military's vast bureaucracy, he has shown a knack for staying out of trouble with his thin- skinned boss. Mattis has even broken Mr. Trump of his habit of calling the retired general \"Mad Dog,\" which Mattis insists was a media invention to begin with. Mr. Trump frequently has lunch and dinners with the defense secretary and speaks glowingly of him to outside advisers. White House officials have said that Mr. Trump sometimes repeats military historical anecdotes he heard from Mattis. Even Mattis' few known stumbles have not dogged him. In August, for example, Mattis told sailors at a submarine base in his home state of Washington that the Navy would give them the worst and the best days of their lives, and then added, \"That means you're not some (expletive) sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. \"You know what I mean, kind of sitting there saying, 'Well, I should have done something with my life.'\" His language was quickly forgotten. The episode pointed to a man who has shaped the job and not let it shape him. So much so that perhaps the most poignant criticism of his tenure has been the secrecy with which the military has handled everything from troop deployment numbers to the details of its military strategies 4 things that often were made public under previous secretaries.

        "article": " In the wake of the school shooting that killed 17, President Trump and the National Rifle Association's main proposal to prevent another tragedy like the one in Parkland, Fla., has been to arm teachers. NRA chief Wayne La Pierre told a crowd at a conservative gathering that cour banks, our airports, our NBA games ... are all more protected than our children at school.  cHighly trained, gun-adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive, the president tweeted\\xa0Thursday. But that\\xa0desire has led some Americans, especially those who discuss race and politics, to raise questions: Will we be arming all teachers, including black teachers or education professionals who teach in mostly minority districts? It's a worthwhile question, given the police killings of unarmed black men in recent years(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national /police-shootings-2017/). It's another layer to the conversation about how racialized the debate around gun violence can be.\\xa0There has not been a mass shooting in a predominantly minority high school that compares to the shooting at\\xa0Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a school of mostly white students in\\xa0a\\xa0fairly affluent suburb.(https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/florida/districts/broward-county-public-schools/marjory-stoneman- douglas-high-school-4749)\\xa0But some activists have pointed out that there are some students who face gun violence in their community on an almost daily basis.  cAnother tragic moment. But there are folks in communities that I know who have been burying their kids for a long time\\xa0because guns have been in their communities. Parents have been grieving because they've been putting their babies in the ground, d\\xa0Eddie S. Glaude, a Princeton University religion and African American studies professor, told MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on Thursday. Glaude added that it took ccertain kinds of people to die for us to get this question on the table. When it comes to arming teachers and the factor race might play, two issues are being raised: (1) Arming teachers of black students who may have a racial bias, and (2)\\xa0arming black teachers and education workers, who face their own risks carrying a weapon. The Internet was quick to remind us that Philando Castile, a cafeteria supervisor at a public school in St. Paul, Minn., was shot dead by a police officer after he told him he was carrying a licensed firearm. Efforts to tackle\\xa0school violence have\\xa0disproportionately impacted black\\xa0students through arrests and restraint, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Although black\\xa0students were only 16 percent of the total student enrollment during the 2011-12 school year, they made up 27 percent of the students referred to law enforcement and nearly double 4 31 percent 4 of the students involved in a school-related arrest,\\xa0according to data from the U.S. Department of Education\\xa0office for civil rights(http://ocrdata.ed.gov/Downloads/CRDC-School-Discipline- Snapshot.pdf). Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for late-night show cFull Frontal with Samantha Bee, mentioned\\xa0how\\xa0carrying a gun could have added to her already-tense relationship\\xa0with a racist teacher.  cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun? Yeah, there are more good, kind, teachers ... but they're not gonna be the ones signing up for guns, d\\xa0Black tweeted(https://twitter.com/ashleyn1cole/status/966452714573041665). Kelly Wickham Hurst, CEO of Being Black at School, a nonprofit that addresses issues impacting black students,\\xa0asked(https://medium.com/@kellywickham /on-protests-arming-teachers-and-what-schools-really-need-535f69d55de4): cHow long before a teacher feels the need to make use of Stand Your Ground while on a school campus? Multiple studies(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/09/27 /yale-study-suggests-racial-bias-among-preschool- teachers/?utm_term=.cf96c2551280), including one from the Yale University Child Study Center,\\xa0have shown that implicit bias against black students shapes how teachers respond to them. That's not to imply explicitly that white teachers will be using guns against black students, but it does factor into how students of color are disciplined.  cImplicit biases do not begin with black men and police. They begin with black preschoolers and their teachers, if not earlier. Implicit bias is like the wind: You can 9t see it, but you can sure see its effects, d\\xa0Yale child psychology professor Walter S. Gilliam previously told The Post. Bree Newsome, an activist who attracted national attention after a mass shooting in a Charleston, S.C., church, argued that the idea that arming teachers with guns will protect youths doesn't seem to take black youths into account. > Whenever politicians talk about giving more guns to people as a solution to gun violence, you can rest assured they aren't talking about Black people b/c we are shot & killed by police for holding BB guns, wallets, cell phones or nothing at all > > 4 Bree Newsome (@BreeNewsome) February 22, 2018(https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/966523139504164864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Michael Harriot, host of the podcast cThe Black One, wrote(https://www.theroot.com/theres-a-theory-that-black-people-buying-guns- could-sto-1823167744?utm_source=theroot_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow) that the idea of black\\xa0educators carrying guns isn't likely to attract lasting support because history has shown that conservatives do not support gun ownership among black Americans as much as they claim.  cIf black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation, he wrote for\\xa0the Root. cWhile no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America 9s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won 9t work. Nearly 6 in 10 4 59 percent 4\\xa0think America would be less safe if more people had guns, according to a recent\\xa0Quinnipiac\\xa0poll(https://poll.qu.edu/national/release- detail?ReleaseID=2521). And only\\xa020 percent say armed teachers are the answer to making schools safer. More than half of Americans do not think the Parkland shooting could have been prevented had teachers been armed, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/20/most- republicans-think-arming-teachers-could-have-prevented-parkland-new-gun-laws- couldnt/?utm_term=.1920ecd7c5c7). The school did have an armed school resource officer assigned to protect students, but he reportedly took a defensive position outside the school and did not enter the building\\xa0during the shooting. The sample size for how black people feel on this issue was too small to break out. But\\xa0the current conversation about school safety appears to have more black Americans drawing attention to the consequences arming teachers could have in schools where implicit biases exist, particularly against black students who are deemed threatening.

Because of the film's success, Disney donated $1 Million for STEM education for young boys and girls in the US(https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27 /after-black-panther-success-disney-donates-money-to-youth-stem-educational- programs.html). Education can change everything, and technology has the power to be the great equalizer. Because of this, African leaders should focus on STEM at an early age so Africa does not fall behind in the technology sector. Leading this charge for STEM education in Africa is Rwanda(https://www.voanews.com/a /rwanda-leading-way-in-girls-in-stem-field/4148108.html). The country has a strategic plan to transform its economy by 2020 and STEM education is at the nexus. Investing in STEM education will not only confront the rampant unemployment challenges we have, but it will also address the gaps in human resources(https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mariame-jamme /africas-workforces-need-r_b_6340556.html) in Africa to build infrastructure, manage natural resources, and control diseases. African leaders must take immediate steps to ensure STEM is included in national curricula. !A journey into Wakanda: How we made Black Panther (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!A journey into Wakanda: How we made Black Panther (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180206094537-02-black-panther-movie- large-169.jpg)(/2018/02/16/africa/black-panther-behind-the-scenes- marvel/index.html) A journey into Wakanda: How we made Black Panther (/2018/02/16/africa/black- panther-behind-the-scenes-marvel/index.html) **Use natural resources to develop your country, and keep them in the people's hands for today and tomorrow**. (http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/08/23/africa.resource.curse/index.html) We have heard horror stories about the resource curse in Africa(http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/08/23/africa.resource.curse/index.html), but in Wakanda, Prince T'Challa and his late father fought to protect their natural resources. The Wakandans added value by developing technologies and did not export their resources hastily. Few countries in Africa have avoided the curse, but one success story is Botswana, one of the world's largest producersof diamonds(https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2018/02/23/lessons- from-marvels-black-panther-natural-resource-management-and-regional- collaboration-in-africa/). The nation has pursued economic diversification and has developed sound fiscal policies to regulate diamond wealth and government spending. Botswana also invested diamond revenues for future generations using a sovereign wealth fund called the Pula Fund(http://www.bankofbotswana.bw/content/2009103013033-pula-fund). Botswana is paving the way for their youth to become educated and empowered, and their society to prosper. Other nations must learn from this, it's the Wakanda way. !The cultural aesthetic has its roots in African-American art and music, but is experiencing a renaissance.

But it comes in many forms -- it is not a one size fits all system. In Wakanda, culture and traditions were important. The Wakandans followed them while evolving their country. They did not simply accept a new form of government because it worked for other societies. Africa has seen charismatic leaders elected democratically and celebrated by the West only for those leaders to change the rules to fit them. Democracy can be manipulated. We saw that recently in Rwanda, and in Uganda for years. Wakanda seems to embrace and exhibit some of the basic tenets of democracy while respecting their culture and tradition. For example, while there were no elections, certain citizens could challenge the king to win the throne. This was their form of election and it was valued and respected. While we modernize and develop our society, we should remember the positive traditions and cultures that got us here and preserve them as we modernize. This is a firm lesson for African leaders.  **Embrace the natural habitat of the land while developing and building up.** In Wakandan architecture, we saw red dirt and market places while alongside super railways and skyscrapers. !Afrofuturism: The genre that made Black Panther (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Afrofuturism: The genre that made Black Panther (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180207112155-afrofuturism- david-6-large-169.jpg)(/2018/02/12/africa/genre-behind-black-panther- afrofuturism/index.html) Afrofuturism: The genre that made Black Panther (/2018/02/12/africa/genre- behind-black-panther-afrofuturism/index.html) Many roads in Africa are built with asphalt which is highly expensive and difficult to procure(http://www.worldhighways.com/categories/materials- production-supply/features/africas-road-builders-need-a-reliable-supply-of- good-quality-bitumen/). Wakandans built using the natural habitat, and fortunately, this is possible in Africa. For example, the Nubian Vault technique (https://www.curbed.com/2017/3/23/15035798/africa-housing-nubian- vault)has been used since the ancient kingdom of Nubia, located in the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan. Environmentalists laud this as environmentally friendly and sustainable, and can help mitigate the effects of climate change. African leaders must support architectural innovation with their natural habitat. \"Black Panther\" inspired me to imagine what Africa could be if our leaders take some bold and collective actions. It also inspired me that we should all be a part of this Wakanda-like development journey by developing leaders, specifically in the public service, that will passionately serve their people, protect their natural resources, embrace innovation and preserve cultures and traditions that are worth preserving.

There were about 1,000 more permanent exclusions in the year 2015-16(https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/permanent-and-fixed-period- exclusions-in-england-2015-to-2016) (6,685 exclusions in all) than there were the year before, according to government statistics. That's out of a total of the roughly 8 million children attending state schools in England. It works out as eight in every 10,000 primary and secondary school pupils, up from seven in every 10,000 the previous year. It's something the government says it's going to look at, in a review led by former children's minister Edward Timpson. But what do we already know about who gets excluded? Certain groups of children, and children in certain parts of the country, are much more likely than average to be expelled from school.     Special educational needs Almost half of all exclusions - either permanent or for a fixed period of time - are of pupils with identified special educational needs. Children with special educational needs are seven times more likely than the average to be permanently excluded, although this proportion has actually slightly fallen as the total number of exclusions has risen. Special educational needs cover a wide range of difficulties and disabilities, which makes learning harder for these children than for other pupils of a similar age. By far the most common reason given for permanently expelling a child is \"persistent disruptive behaviour\". Other less common reasons include physical and verbal abuse, bullying, racist or sexually inappropriate behaviour and drug and alcohol use. This isn't the whole story, though. The official statistics only capture formal exclusions. But there are concerns that some children are being \"managed out\" of schools in less formal ways.    Exclusions in numbers   * More than a quarter of permanent exclusions were pupils aged 14 - those just about to start their GCSE courses   * Boys were more than three times as likely as girls to be permanently excluded   * Pupils claiming free school meals - available to households on lower incomes - were about four times as likely to be excluded   * Pupils receiving support for special educational needs were the most likely to be excluded (seven times as often as those without special educational needs)   * Black Caribbean pupils were over three times more likely to be permanently excluded than the average   * Children in the West Midlands are twice as likely to be excluded (12 in every 10,000) as children in the South East of England (six in every 10,000)  _Source: Department for Education_    'Informally' excluded A report by centre-left think tank IPPR(https://www.ippr.org/files/2017-10 /making-the-difference-report-october-2017.pdf), published in October, found the total number of children being taught in \"alternative provision\" for excluded children is far higher than the total number of reported exclusions. When children are excluded from mainstream or special schools they often end up in a pupil referral unit or an independent or non-registered school. Part of the gap identified by the IPPR is thought to be down to children who were informally excluded and so don't appear in the exclusion statistics, but do appear in the census of children in alternative provision. Another part of the explanation may be children staying in alternative provision for more than a year - so in subsequent years they appear in the alternative provision data but not in that year's tally of exclusions.   * What is it like to be excluded from school?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-37563774)   * Half of children expelled from school 'mentally ill'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40667089)  But pupil referral units were not designed to be permanent settings for children to complete their compulsory education. They were designed to refer them on to another mainstream or a special school. Kiran Gill, one of the authors of the IPPR report and founder of charity The Difference(https://www.the-difference.com/), says: \"Increasing numbers of children are being referred close to their exams and end up doing their exams in pupil referral units.\" She says only 1% of GCSE candidates in pupil referral units leave with the five good GCSEs they would need to continue with their education (A*-C under the old system or grades 4-9 under incoming GCSE reforms). Last January, more than two-thirds of all pupils in alternative provision were in Years 10 and 11 - their GCSE years. School inspectorate Ofsted has raised concerns that schools are removing children from their rolls as they approach GCSE as a way of \"gaming the system\" in performance tables. There also appears to be a group of children who are being repeatedly, informally sent home from school due to difficult behaviour without ever being permanently, formally excluded, according to Catriona Moore, an education policy expert at the National Autistic Society. These children miss out on large parts of their schooling without showing up in the exclusions statistics, she says. Of a survey of 2,573 parents conducted by the charity, one in four said their child had been \"informally\" excluded at least once in the last year. Malcolm Trobe, of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says schools also have to consider the other children in a classroom. \"If you have a child whose behaviour is extremely disruptive and it's impacting the education of 28 other children in the class, you may have to take some serious action,\" he says. He adds that funding pressures have meant schools are less able to access external support like counselling, behavioural management and mental health services for young people and in some cases, \"the only way to access this external support for a child is to have them excluded\". Launching the government's external review of school exclusions, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: \"Children only get one chance at their education and they deserve the best. But for too many children - and often those who are most vulnerable - there are inconsistencies when it comes to their experiences of school and too many parents are left worried and concerned. \"That's not good enough which is why we are going to improve our understanding of these important issues and tackle them head on.\"    Read more from Reality Check(http://www.bbc.co.uk/realitycheck) Send us your questions(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747) Follow us on Twitter(https://twitter.com/bbcrealitycheck)    ",

          "article": "  Usually the Iranian regime 9s assault on its people 9s dignity is measured in its political prisoners, its laws mandating modest dress for women, its prosecutions of gays and its stage-managed elections. An under- reported aspect of this story, though, is the state 9s treatment of the Baha 9i, a small monotheistic faith that was founded in Iran in the 19th century and that honors Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. In Iran, this minority faces systemic discrimination reminiscent of Nazi Germany 9s Nuremberg laws or China 9s treatment of the Falun Gong. Its followers are denied government services, pensions and representation in the government. In every sense they are second-class citizens. And yet their fate is rarely discussed in the context of Iran 9s freedom movement. This will hopefully change soon. Earlier this month, the Baha 9i International Community established a new internet archive of official documents, news articles, audio recordings and other primary sources that document Iran 9s decades-long campaign against followers of the religion. State-sponsored discrimination against the Baha 9i was a feature of the Iranian government under Shah Reza Pahlavi. But the persecution intensified under the Islamic Republic that unseated him in 1979. One letter from the archive(https://iranbahaipersecution.bic.org/archive/request-water- connection-kayhan-zarei-rejected) shows how a Baha 9i citizen 9s property was denied a connection to fresh water supply because of his faith. Others show lenient sentences meted out for Iranians convicted of heinous crimes against Baha 9i citizens.        A particularly damning document in the new archive is a Feb. 25, 1991, secret directive(https://iranbahaipersecution.bic.org/archive/supreme-revolutionary- cultural-councils-secret-memo-dealing-bahais) from the current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. He writes that as a general policy the Baha 9i will not be arrested, exiled or imprisoned without reason. Nonetheless, cThe government 9s dealings with them must be in such a way that their progress and development are blocked. He then lays out what that means. For example, he says Baha 9i citizens can be enrolled in schools, so long as they do not self-identify as Baha 9i. Universities must not let in Baha 9i citizens, or must expel such students once their religious beliefs become known. He ominously writes, cA plan must be devised to confront and destroy their cultural roots outside the country. Khamenei says they may be permitted to obtain work permits, rations cards and passports, cso long as it does not encourage them to be Baha 9is. But no high-status positions should be given to Baha 9i citizens, even if they remain in the closet. cDeny them any position of influence, such as in the educational sector, etc., he writes. That was more than 25 years ago, but the new archives show that they remain second-class citizens. A 2013 letter(https://iranbahaipersecution.bic.org/archive/manouher-baghdadi-not- entitled-salary-and-pension) for example to Manouher Baghdadi says he is not eligible to receive his pension because cthe individual is a follower of the perverse sect of Baha 9ism. It 9s almost impossible to know how many Baha 9i live in Iran today. The regime disbanded the Baha 9i official governing council in 1983. Iran 9s census does not bother to count them. The Baha 9i International Community estimates that there are 300,000 Baha 9i in Iran.     James Samimi Farr, a media officer for Baha 9is of the United States, said the new archives was established this month to respond to crising international interest to understand the situation for Baha 9is of Iran. That timing also coincides with the latest uprisings against a regime that has enriched elites and further strangled the political freedoms of its average citizens. Let 9s hope this movement ends the rule of the current clerics and terror masters. But that alone will not be enough. Iran 9s next leaders must also end the state-sponsored discrimination against the Baha 9i and make amends for the century of persecution authored by both the shahs and the mullahs.

Research finds that when students change schools they're more likely to be less engaged, which could lower their grades and increase the risk they will drop out of high school. Students generally lose about three months of reading and math with each transfer. A promising new program for low-income students and their families at an Atlanta school has cut the student turnover rate by nearly half. * * * When Nicole Evans Jones became principal at Thomasville Heights Elementary School two years ago, she inherited a crisis. The Atlanta school, at times, has been the worst performing elementary school in all of Georgia 3 and one of its poorest.\\xa0  \\xa0  \"I have students that have been in four or five schools by second grade or so,\" Jones told CBS News' Mark Strassmann. \"Like 40 percent of the kids in that class might not be there at the end of the year.\"  \\xa0  Michael Lucas helps lead the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation(https://avlf.org/), a group that gets attorneys to fight for free on behalf of low-income tenants. \"They knew they had to address that problem.

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg) New Mexico 9s education chief is being blasted\\xa0for linking the growth of charter schools to the controversial 19th-century idea of American expansion known as Manifest Destiny. Even after he apologized to American Indian leaders, criticism of his remarks has persisted. At a conference in December, Education Secretary-designate Christopher Ruszkowski said\\xa0school choice, which is championed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is cquintessentially American.  cThis is a country built over the last 250 years on things like freedom, choice, competition, options, going west, Manifest Destiny 4 these are the fundamental principles of this country, he was reported as saying by the Albuquerque Journal(https://www.abqjournal.com/1104504/ped-chief- school-choice-is-quintessentially-american.html). cThat 9s why charter schools make so much sense 4 high-quality options 4 in the context of where we are as a country. He also rejected suggestions from Democrats and progressive educators that the United States should look to other countries with successful education systems 4\\xa0such as high-achieving Finland 4 for ideas to reform the American public school systems. cI hate to put it this bluntly, but this isn 9t Finland, he said. cYou can 9t redesign as if we were Finland. Too late. This country wasn 9t built that way. Leaders of American Indian nations said they were cappalled and deeply offended by the reference to Manifest Destiny, and said the remarks lacked cany sensitivity, understanding and appreciation of the atrocious impacts of Manifest Destiny upon generations of our people. Manifest Destiny\\xa0describes the notion that the United States was destined by God to dominate North America. The United States grew through territorial expansion in the first part of the 1800s, but that expansion also sparked a war with Mexico, expanded slavery and led to the systematic relocation and brutalization\\xa0of Native Americans and other occupants of lands\\xa0seized by the U.S. government.\\xa0American Indians continued to struggle against\\xa0U.S. government policies in the 20th century. Ruszkowski 4 who is a designee because he has not been confirmed by the state legislature 4 reached out to every tribal leader in the state, according to a spokesman for the New Mexico Public Education Department, to express remorse for the cpoorly phrased historical reference and to clarify that portion of his speech. He also met with several tribal leaders and the vice president of the Navajo Nation, the spokesman said. Ruszkowski himself said in a statement: > cI reject any doctrine, past or present, that stands in the way of making excellent schools a reality for all of our children, and stand alongside all of New Mexico 9s children, families, educators, and tribal leaders who are fighting for schools that are both higher performing academically and more culturally and linguistically responsive.\\xa0We must continue to partner and collaborate on behalf of our children. Criticism started\\xa0shortly after the remarks appeared in the media.\\xa0E. Paul Torres, chairman of the\\xa0All Pueblo Council of Governors, wrote an op- ed in the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper(http://www.santafenewmexican.com/opinion/my_view/the-legacy-of- manifest-destiny-trauma-and-suffering/article_1a6e980c-41ff-50bc- bee4-40836ad18ddf.html) that said in part: > cThe All Pueblo Council of Governors consists of the 19 sovereign Pueblo Nations of New Mexico, with the 20th Pueblo nation, Ysleta del Sur, in Texas. We are the oldest political organization in the country, dating back to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. We are the primary and official advocacy organization representing the Pueblo Nations on all matters locally and at the state and federal levels. > > cWe are appalled and deeply offended by the recent statements at a charter school conference by Public Education Department Secretary-designate Christopher Ruszkowski regarding Manifest Destiny as the continuing core value of this nation and the state that drives the education agenda. This is utterly disgraceful, lacking any sensitivity, understanding and appreciation of the atrocious impacts of Manifest Destiny upon generations of our people. The principles of Manifest Destiny have inflicted multigenerational trauma. That is the legacy of Manifest Destiny in our history. The comments should be evaluated in context, according to Regis Pecos, co- director of the Leadership Institute based at the Santa Fe Indian School in New Mexico, which was established in 1997 to foster discourse on public policy and tribal community issues facing the 22 tribal nations in New Mexico.  cIf these are deeply embedded values of Ruszkowski, then it is unfortunate that he is the secretary of the Public Education Department in a place where you have surviving sovereign nations who were the victims of this very doctrine that he makes reference to as the very foundation of the principles that made America great, d\\xa0Pecos said.\\xa0Pecos served as\\xa0lieutenant governor and governor of the Tribal Council at Cochiti Pueblo, was executive director of the New Mexico Office of Indian Affairs for 16 years and was chief of staff to the New Mexico speaker of the house as well as a trustee of Princeton University. He said such statements to American Indians are cwhat the Holocaust is to the Jews and what cslavery is to our African American brothers and sisters. Anpao Duta Flying Earth, head of School at the Native American Community Academy,\\xa0wrote a response on the website(http://leadership- pdc.org/articles/an-educators-response-to-the-secretarys-comments-on-manifest- destiny/) of the Center for Student Leadership in Albuquerque that said in part: > cMy grandmother first told me about Manifest Destiny in the context of genocide and brutal colonization of our ancestors. European colonizers used the idea of Manifest Destiny based in a righteous divine purpose to validate the killing, raping, and theft of indigenous land and ideas. She would often emphasize that though Manifest Destiny began hundreds of years ago, it is still alive in peoples 9 ideas today. It is the cause for a corrupt notion of property rights that disregards the inherent rights and responsibilities that indigenous people have to the land. Manifest Destiny has led to the paternalistic treatment of tribes by the federal government articulated in policy and de facto treatment of indigenous people that sends a message of 8we know what 9s best for you 9 and in fact 8it 9s our divine right to control you and your land base. 9 > > cBecause of my knowledge and personal experience with the idea of Manifest Destiny, I was shocked to hear it referenced in a speech by the New Mexico secretary of education as a positive baseline theory in our education systems. Everyone in the education field, especially the New Mexico secretary of education, has the responsibility to learn about the local context and culture of the people, if for nothing else than to better understand the thousands of children and families who are affected by their leadership. What message is proliferated by the validation of Manifest Destiny as quintessentially American? > > cI understand that the intentions of these comments are based in the support of high-quality charter schools. However, there is no context that validates the use of this term in relation to progress without disregarding the brutal reality of what happened in this country 9s history under the auspice of Manifest Destiny. We need to demand accountability of individuals who carelessly use terms that buttress domination and supremacy of one group over another. Accountability is necessary when considering that the individual who made these remarks is responsible for the leadership of an entire state 9s education system.  ",

        "article": " When President Donald Trump announced that DeVos would lead the federal school safety commission, he said that part of the commission's mandate would be to look into the \"repeal of the Obama Administration's 'Rethink School Discipline'\" policies. Supporters of keeping the guidance in place have argued that racial bias in school discipline policies has been well documented. The Obama administration's 2014 guidance noted that in 2013, black students were more than three times as likely as their white peers to be expelled or suspended. The Education Department did not issue a response to GAO's findings. At a congressional hearing last month, DeVos defended her agency's decision to re- examine the school discipline guidance. \"The stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps,\" she said. \"But I have nothing to say at this point about where that is.\" The GAO analysis was requested by Democratic Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York and Bobby Scott of Virginia, who in a joint statement said it was evidence that race plays a significant role in discipline disparities. \"The analysis shows that students of color suffer harsher discipline for lesser offenses than their white peers and that racial bias is a driver of discipline disparities,\" Scott said. \"This report underscores the need to combat these gross disparities by strengthening, not rescinding, the 2014 Discipline Guidance Package, which recommends specific strategies to reduce the disparities without jeopardizing school safety.\" On Wednesday morning, DeVos met with educators and advocates who support maintaining or strengthening the Obama-era guidance, with plans to meet in the afternoon with opponents who want to roll it back. Participants in the morning meeting said DeVos expressed a willingness to hear from both sides at the start of a meeting that lasted nearly a half-hour. Fallon Daniels, an assistant principal at Danbury High School in Danbury, Connecticut, who participated in the morning session, told CNN that DeVos said her intention was to create \"nurturing and safe schools for students\" but that she didn't state a position. Daniels supports the Obama policy and said she worried that if it's rescinded, it could create a \"punitive culture and climate\" in America's schools. \"We don't believe in isolating our students or marginalizing our students based on mistakes that they make as they grow up and become a part of our society,\" she said. Evan Stone, the co-founder of Educators for Excellence, an education advocacy group that wants the Obama-era guidance kept in place, said that DeVos \"said very clearly that she believes there is a problem with racial disparities in school discipline.\" Stone, who attended the morning meeting, said it was \"unfortunate\" that supporters of the Obama guidance and those who want to see it revoked were not in the same room. \"I would have loved to have heard the other arguments and to respond to them,\" he said, adding that he believed he and others who want to keep the guidance \"would have engaged in a respectful dialogue, and I hope that's true on the other side.\"  ",

The Morrissey House in Ontario offers a 13% discount to women on Mondays, recognising that women earn 87 cents for every dollar men earn in Canada. Owner Mark Serre said an irate customer has threatened to file a complaint with the provincial human rights commission. The new promotion also raises money for local charities that benefit women. Mr Serre said he has no problem with the customer complaining to the human rights commission, but he does not think the promotion is discriminatory.    \"It's his right. If he feels wronged, then I applaud him for taking it to the (commission). But I think he's taking it the wrong way,\" Mr Serre told the CBC. \"As a general rule of life, women should get paid equally. I think that's important. Is it worth my 13 per cent on a Monday night? Absolutely. Is it worth a conversation? Absolutely. I hope people embrace it.\" The Ontario Human Rights Commission investigates complaints that violate the province's human rights code, including complaints about discrimination against gender.

In 2013, another London, Ontario, establishment faced a human rights complaint because it offered women a 50% discount on cover on its \"ladies' night\". The human rights tribunal ruled that while the practice may have been discriminatory, it did not qualify as \"substantive discrimination\". \"There are many things that could be said about societal beliefs in Ontario, but the notion than men are less worthy than women is not among them,\" the tribunal ruled.

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is making the announcement at a global conference in Senegal, as part of a new emphasis on targeting aid at education projects. Ms Mordaunt said supporting schools in poorer countries was a \"hard-headed\" investment in a more prosperous future. But aid agencies warned the amounts promised were still insufficient. Ms Mordaunt is promising \\xa3225m funding over three years at a global education conference in Dakar, hosted by France's President Emmanuel Macron and Senegal's President Macky Sall.     Building schools This event will see international leaders pledging funds for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), which works with developing countries on raising education standards in some of the poorest parts of the world. Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and now chair of the GPE, said that by \"increasing by 50% its commitment\" the UK would give \"millions of children an opportunity to go to school\". The UK government has faced accusations of either giving too much or too little in overseas aid. Backbench critics have called for a reduction in aid budgets when public services are under pressure at home. While aid agencies have called for the UK to show stronger leadership with more support for developing countries. The UK's previous contribution to this global education fund has been \\xa352m per year and will now offer up to \\xa375m per year - with the GPE a high- profile part of the UK's support for overseas education. But some aid agencies questioned whether such a full amount would be delivered, as this will be conditional on the level of contributions from other countries. If these other contributions from donors are not sufficient, as has happened previously, aid agencies warn that there will be no significant increase in the level of UK funding. Ms Mordaunt says that the UK wants to help prevent the \"terrible waste of potential\" when \"half the world's children leave primary school unable to read or write\".

The funding will build 2,400 classrooms and train 170,000 teachers. There will be an emphasis on teacher quality - after warnings from the United Nations that millions of children were attending schools in sub-Saharan Africa, but were leaving without even learning the basics(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41388080). * * *   * The 350 million people who don 9t officially exist(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41730606)   * 'In school, but learning nothing'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41388080)   * 10 toughest places for girls to go to school(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41558486)   * 'Zero progress' on school places, says UN(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41149083)   * What's it like to learn to read at 60?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41204118)  * * * \"We need an education revolution, but to succeed in tackling this global learning crisis, we will not just need to be open-hearted - we need to be hard-headed too,\" says Ms Mordaunt. \"The UK will lead the way by supporting countries' governments to fundamentally overhaul their education systems to make sure they can ultimately step up and provide a good education for their own people. \"All children deserve a decent education to make the most of their talents and to help lift themselves and their countries out of poverty - building a more prosperous and more stable future for us all.\"  'Sustainable approach' In the autumn, the international development select committee called for the UK government to give more of its aid budget to education(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42047678). A report from the committee said that at present about 7% of UK aid was spent on education.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Four out of five adult women in Niger are illiterate  It called for this to increase, arguing that improving schools and teaching would provide a more long-term and sustainable approach to development. But the committee chairman Stephen Twigg said he was \"very disappointed\" that the amount pledged by the UK was much less than recommended by the committee. He highlighted that the conditions attached to the amount promised could mean no real increase is delivered. Kate Osamor, Labour's shadow international development secretary, said: \"While it may sound like a lot of money, this is a deeply dispiriting announcement from the government\". She said that the amount promised would leave the GPE without enough funding was \"surrendering Britain's reputation as a global leader\". Aid campaigners have called for a bigger increase in financial support from the UK to match the scale of the challenge. The One campaign, which works to reduce poverty in Africa, says that this pledge is less generous than the previous funding round in 2014, when \\xa3300m was promised over four years. But this was conditional on levels of funding from other donor countries - and when this was not forthcoming the amount given by the UK was about \\xa350m per year. Romilly Greenhil of the One campaign said: \"A higher pledge would have given the UK a golden opportunity to demonstrate global leadership on education and use our expertise to promote quality education for all - an opportunity that now risks being lost.\" This week figures from Unicef showed that almost a third of young people living in countries affected by conflict, mostly in Africa, were illiterate.

The program seeks to dignify the critical role of teachers in a democratic society by promoting professional preparation that is rich in the arts, humanities and ethnic studies. **By Stephen Mucher** In the aftermath of the Feb. 14 shooting deaths of 17 people at a South Florida high school, some political leaders are saying that similar tragedies could be prevented by deputizing, training and arming teachers. Advocates for broader conceal-and-carry laws in schools argue that a more vigilant educator workforce would prove both a deterrent and a defense against the inevitable threat posed by psychologically troubled teens. As a teacher who has spent a career working alongside fellow educators in urban and rural areas alike, I 9m concerned about that strategy. I join many other educators who worry that weaponizing teachers would further militarize learning environments, increase the risk of deadly accidents, and offer little protection against a determined student with a military-grade assault rifle. This debate, which was only recently relegated to the margins of our political discourse, is likely to grow louder with each successive school shooting. President Trump spoke Wednesday to survivors of the Feb. 14 attack at Florida 9s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a 19-year-old firing a semiautomatic weapon, making his National Rifle Association-endorsed position clear. cIf you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, Trump said, cthey could very well end the attack very quickly. I 9ll let others, particularly public-health professionals, assess the president 9s case. What I 9m most concerned about now is what an armed teaching workforce would do to my profession. What type of individual would choose or reject a teaching career in the future under such conditions? How does the presumption of an armed faculty reshape the relationship between teachers and students? And for students who must increasingly learn how to challenge authority, what ideas get stifled when their teacher holsters a 9mm Glock on his or her waistband? These questions are critical at a time when many of our democratic institutions face unprecedented challenge. Our gun debates reflect national politics characterized by predictable patterns of inaction, distrust, incivility and ideological entrenchment. Any long-term solution to this democratic crisis will require a generation of youths prepared to discover what their parents and grandparents found so elusive. They will need to find courageous empathy with others, reconcile historical injustices and identify common ground across intractable ethnic, religious, economic and geographic differences. These students will need teachers who can initiate and model democratic practices sadly missing from our nation 9s capital to the statehouse. Such practices require patience and courageous nonviolence. We will need the more than 3 million working teachers who are vigilant, deputized, trained and armed with the knowledge and skill needed to bring their students together. Today 9s teachers can tap into a noble legacy. Our greatest educators have long helped students bridge the gap between an unjust, violent society and the more inclusive possibilities of democracy. The 19th-century schoolmaster, for example, encouraged pupils see beyond a harsh frontier and imagine more humane civic institutions. Enslaved men and women organized clandestine classrooms on the plantation, passing the literacy of liberation on to their children. Ethnic minority teachers, representing over a century of American immigration, helped students transcend criminalizing stereotypes and recognize their academic potential. And LGBTQ teachers provided comfort and hope in communities where students knew that exposure could lead to greater exclusion and violence. When I talk to my teaching colleagues, I still hear this idealism. In these historic examples, we recognize educators who put students first, typically ahead of their own personal safety. Many of us feel called to this work. Our family and friends often describe us, in our passion, as strangely ccut out for an impossible profession. We laughingly kid each other that teachers care a little too much. Given this professional history, the fact that educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas stood between a deadly threat and their own students should be less surprising. Scott Beigel, Aaron Feis and Chris Hixon join teachers who paid our profession 9s highest price at Columbine High School in Colorado, Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and too many other schools where mass shootings have occurred. Countless others are returning to traumatized students with resolve. One Parkland teacher spoke for many of us when he said, cI would take a bullet for the kids. This resolute hopefulness remains central to the ethos of the profession we chose. Each day we choose to see in each student the better angels of their nature. Our vocation is built on this continuous act of trust. Without this trust, initiated with courage, the learning relationships we seek are impossible. Without this trust, there is no democracy for us to keep. Upholding these values does not make us naive. Ask any veteran teacher and you will hear stories about students with dispositions now painfully familiar in the profile of too many school shooters. Few of us honestly think, cIt won 9t happen here. After all, we protect our students each day from classmates who are either momentarily or routinely mean-spirited. We also know that obtaining a gun is easier for our students than returning the parental permission forms required for field trips or sporting events. We know colleagues who are drawn to the enforcement side of education, and, admittedly, some small number of these individuals have a role to play in schools. But the widespread arming of teachers could skew our workforce profoundly. Individuals who are inclined toward caring, instructive relational work could be driven away from this militarized environment. Individuals inclined toward authoritarian interactions could increasingly decide that schools best reward their desire to exercise power. Testimonials from\\xa0one of the more celebrated organizations(http://fastersaveslives.org/) promoting and training armed teachers illustrate concerns about changing the central mission of our profession. I am a different person after this training, one school employee explains. A third-grade teacher describes the new cmental preparation emerging from her course. Another educator states, cI am changed thanks to this training. As educators, we have no reason to doubt these testimonials. But many of us love our profession far too much to want this kind of change.  ",

        "article": " SCIENCE fiction is littered with examples of intelligent computers, from HAL 9000 in c2001: A Space Odyssey to Eddie in cThe Hitchhiker 9s Guide to the Galaxy d. One thing such fictional machines have in common is a tendency to go wrong, to the detriment of the characters in the story. HAL murders most of the crew of a mission to Jupiter. Eddie obsesses about trivia, and thus puts the spacecraft he is in charge of in danger of destruction. In both cases, an attempt to build something useful and helpful has created a monster. Successful science fiction necessarily plays on real hopes and fears. In the 1960s and 1970s, when HAL and Eddie were dreamed up, attempts to create artificial intelligence (AI) were floundering, so both hope and fear were hypothetical. But that has changed. The invention of deep learning, a technique which uses special computer programs called neural networks to churn through large volumes of data looking for and remembering patterns, means that technology which gives a good impression of being intelligent is spreading rapidly. Applications range from speech-to-text transcription to detecting early signs of blindness. AI now runs quality control in factories and cooling systems in data centres. Governments hope to employ it to recognise terrorist propaganda sites and remove them from the web. And it is central to attempts to develop self-driving vehicles. Of the ten most valuable quoted companies in the world, seven say they have plans to put deep-learning-based AI at the heart of their operations.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

It certainly lacks the apparently conscious motivation of the sci-fi stuff. But it does turn both hope and fear into matters for the present day, rather than an indeterminate future. And many worry that even today 9s cAI- lite has the capacity to morph into a monster. The fear is not so much of devices that stop obeying instructions and instead follow their own agenda, but rather of something that does what it is told (or, at least, attempts to do so), but does it in a way that is incomprehensible. The reason for this fear is that deep-learning programs do their learning by rearranging their digital innards in response to patterns they spot in the data they are digesting. Specifically, they emulate the way neuroscientists think that real brains learn things, by changing within themselves the strengths of the connections between bits of computer code that are designed to behave like neurons. This means that even the designer of a neural network cannot know, once that network has been trained, exactly how it is doing what it does. Permitting such agents to run critical infrastructure or to make medical decisions therefore means trusting people 9s lives to pieces of equipment whose operation no one truly understands. If, however, AI agents could somehow explain why they did what they did, trust would increase and those agents would become more useful. And if things were to go wrong, an agent 9s own explanation of its actions would make the subsequent inquiry far easier. Even as they acted up, both HAL and Eddie were able to explain their actions. Indeed, this was a crucial part of the plots of the stories they featured in. At a simpler level, such powers of self- explanation are something software engineers would like to emulate in real AI. Open the box One of the first formal research programs to attempt to crack open the AI cblack box is the Explainable AI (XAI) project, which is being run by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an organisation that does much of America 9s military research. In particular, America 9s armed forces would like to use AI to help with reconnaissance. Dave Gunning, XAI 9s head, observes that monitoring places like North Korea from on high, by spy plane or satellite, creates a huge amount of data. Analysts looking at these data would certainly value something that alerted them automatically to suspicious activity. It would, though, also be valuable if such an agent could explain its decisions, so that the person being alerted was able to spot and ignore the inevitable false positives. Mr Gunning says that analysts from one of America 9s spy agencies, the NSA, are already overwhelmed by the recommendations of old-fashioned pattern-recognition software pressing them to examine certain pieces of information. As AI adds to that deluge, it is more important than ever that computer programs should be able to explain why they are calling something to a human operator 9s attention. How the NSA is responding to this is, understandably, a secret. But civilian programmes are also trying to give neural networks the power to explain themselves by communicating their internal states in ways that human beings can comprehend. Trevor Darrell 9s AI research group at the University of California, Berkeley, for example, has been working with software trained to recognise different species of birds in photographs. Instead of merely identifying, say, a Western Grebe, the software also explains that it thinks the image in question shows a Western Grebe because the bird in it has a long white neck, a pointy yellow beak and red eyes. The program does this by drawing on the assistance of a second neural network which has been trained to match the internal features of the agent doing the recognising (ie, the pattern of connections between its cneurons d) with sentences that people have written, describing what they see in a picture being examined. So, as one AI system learns to classify birds, the other learns simultaneously to classify the behaviour of the first system, in order to explain how that system has reached its decisions. A team led by Mark Riedl at the Georgia Institute of Technology has employed a similar technique to encourage a game-playing AI to explain its moves. The team asked people to narrate their own experiences of playing an arcade game called Frogger. They then trained an AI agent to match these narratives to the internal features of a second agent that had already learned to play Frogger. The result is a system which provides snippets of human language that describe the way the second agent is playing the game. Such ways of opening the black box of AI work up to a point. But they can go only as far as a human being can, since they are, in essence, aping human explanations. Because people can understand the intricacies of pictures of birds and arcade video games, and put them into words, so can machines that copy human methods. But the energy supply of a large data centre or the state of someone 9s health are far harder for a human being to analyse and describe. AI already outperforms people at such tasks, so human explanations are not available to act as models. !(https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print- edition/20180217_STD002_0.jpg) Fortunately, other ways exist to examine and understand an AI 9s output. Anupam Datta, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, for instance, is not attempting to peer inside the black box directly, in the ways that Dr Darrell and Dr Riedl are. Rather, he is trying to do so obliquely, by cstress-testing the outputs of trained systems 4for example, those assessing job candidates. Dr Datta feeds the system under test a range of input data and examines its output for dodgy, potentially harmful or discriminatory results. He gives the example of a removals firm that uses an automated system to hire new employees. The system might take a candidate 9s age, sex, weightlifting ability, marital status and education, as described in the application, as its inputs, and churn out a score which indicates how likely that candidate is to be a good employee. Clearly one of these pieces of information, the ability to lift heavy things, is both pertinent and likely to favour male candidates. So in this case, to test the system for bias against females, Dr Datta 9s program alters randomly selected applications from women to make them appear to be from men and, separately, swaps the weightlifting abilities of female applicants 4again, at random 4with that of applicants from both sexes. If the randomisation of sex produces no change in the number of women offered jobs by the AI, but randomising weightlifting ability increases it (because some women now appear to have cmale dabilities to lift weights), then it is clear that weightlifting ability itself, not an applicant 9s sex, is affecting the hiring process. Dr Datta 9s approach does not get to the heart of how and why agents are making decisions, but, like stress testing an aircraft, it helps stop undesirable outcomes. It lets those who make and operate AI ensure they are basing decisions on the right inputs, and not harmful spurious correlations. And there are other ways still of trying to peer into machines 9 minds. Some engineers, for example, are turning to techniques, such as cognitive psychology, that human beings use to understand their own minds. They argue that, since artificial neural networks are supposed to work like brains, it makes sense to employ the tools of human psychology to investigate them. One example of such an approach is research by DeepMind, an AI firm in London that is owned by Google 9s parent company, Alphabet. This has yielded an intriguing insight into the behaviour of a piece of image-matching software the company has designed. A group of DeepMind 9s engineers, led by David Barrett, showed the software sets of three images. The first of each set was a cprobe image of a certain shape and colour. Of the other two, one matched the probe in shape and the second matched it in colour. By measuring how often the system chose the shape match as opposed to the colour match, Dr Barrett and his team were able to deduce that DeepMind 9s image matcher equates images in the way that people do 4that is, according to shape rather than colour. Elucidating in this way the broader principles of how a particular AI makes decisions might be useful when preparing it for deployment in the world. It might also help accident investigators, by directing them towards the most likely sorts of explanation for a failure. Those inclined to try to crack open the cminds behind AI thus have many ways of doing so. Some people, however, think this whole approach wrongheaded. They observe that those decisions made by AI which are hardest to scrutinise are necessarily the most complex and thus likely to be the most useful. Easy-to-parse tasks, like playing video games and naming birds, are of limited value. Decisions made while balancing an electrical grid or managing a city 9s traffic flow are harder to explain, especially as many of them are taken at levels beyond human processing capabilities. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, calls this kind of processing artificial intuition. Dr Bengio says such artificial intuition was on display during the most public demonstration of deep-learning that has ever taken place. This was a Go match held in 2016 between an AI agent and Lee Sedol, the world 9s greatest human player. The agent in question, AlphaGo, was trained by DeepMind. It sometimes made unexpected moves that human experts could not explain. At first those moves appeared to be errors. But AlphaGo then used the surprising position thus generated to dominate the rest of the match. Intriguingly, moves like these are also sometimes made by human Go masters. They are known in Japanese as _kami no itte_ ( cthe hand of God d, or cdivine moves d). As the name suggests, a player who feels a move is divinely directed in this way usually cannot say how or why he placed a certain stone where he did. Indeed, the fact that players cannot explain the reasoning behind their best moves offers a hint as to why old-style Go-playing computers, based on formal logic, were never any good. Neural learning systems, both those that have evolved in brains and those now being put into computers, can handle the task of playing Go. But human language cannot describe it. Pandora 9s box? There is, though, a crucial difference between the explanations that humans offer up for their own behaviour, and those available from machines. As Dan Sperber, a cognitive scientist at the Jean Nicod Institute, in Paris, observes, people tend to construct reasons for their behaviour which align with information mutually available to speaker and listener, and with their own interests, rather than describing accurately how their thoughts led to a decision. As he puts it, cthe reason to give reasons is so that others will evaluate your actions and beliefs d. Today 9s autonomous machines do not have their own interests to serve. Instead, their explanations are forged by and for human beings. Some speculate that this may change in the future, if AI is developed which, like the fictional variety, seems to have motives of its own, rather than merely acting at human whim. Jacob Turner, a specialist in international law, suggests ascribing legal personhood to AI will then be necessary if those harmed by such advanced agents are to seek compensation and justice. !(https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print- edition/20180217_STD003_0.jpg) That is probably a long way off. But even today 9s AI may raise ticklish legal questions. In particular, machine minds that cannot explain themselves, or whose detailed operation is beyond the realm of human language, pose a problem for criminal law. As Rebecca Williams, a legal scholar at Oxford University, observes, if machines lack the ability to explain their actions, current law might struggle to identify criminal intent in acts that arise because of decisions they have made. cIn criminal law, she says, cthe thing that 9s interesting is having the third party breaking the chain of causation that is not a human being. That is really new. This is not a matter of AI agents themselves acting in a criminal manner in the way Mr Turner speculates might one day happen. But if the process by which a machine made a decision cannot be subject to cross-examination, because neither the machine nor its creator is able to explain what went on, then deciding the guilt or innocence of a human being associated with that decision may be impossible. For example, if a neural network that authorises loans cannot explain why it gives certain people certain scores that seem biased against one social group or another, it may be impossible to determine whether its operators had arranged this intentionally (which would be an offence in most jurisdictions), or whether lazy coding by its designers had led to accidental bias (which would probably be a matter for the civil courts rather than the criminal ones). Similarly, if the AI that ran the visual systems of a driverless taxi were a black box that could not be interrogated about its choices, it might be hard to know whether a death caused by that car was the fault of the manufacturer or of the firm responsible for maintaining the vehicle. The world is still a few years from the moment a case involving a driverless car might come before the courts. A case of social bias, however, is eminently conceivable even now. It does not require the imaginations of Arthur C. Clarke or Douglas Adams, the inventors, respectively, of HAL and Eddie, to envisage the advantages of software that can not only act, but also explain the reasons behind its actions.

Well in Trump's 2018 Black History Month proclamation, the president chose to highlight the contributions of one particular group of black Americans: veterans. The president wrote(https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions /president-donald-j-trump-proclaims-february-2018-national-african-american- history-month/): \"This annual observance is an opportunity to remember the challenges of our past, but also to honor countless African-American heroes who inspire us to shape our country 9s future.\\xa0 This year 9s theme, 'African Americans in Times of War,' calls our attention to the heroic contributions of African Americans during our Nation 9s military conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to present-day operations.\" The president proceeds to highlight the contributions of black veterans to America and\\xa0seems to imply that racism in the military as something that was a significant problem more than half a century ago, saying: \"It was not until 1948 that President Harry S. Truman ordered desegregation of the military, providing 'equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Forces without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.'\\xa0 It took another 5 years before the Secretary of Defense abolished the last segregated African-American military unit.\" The history of racism in the U.S. military goes back to before the United States was established, with black people\\xa0defending a country that didn't protect them. And while many laws have changed, legislating against biased and hateful beliefs is\\xa0impossible\\xa0and has actually become of increased concern in recent years.\\xa0To some, the lack\\xa0of diversity among the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other high-level\\xa0positions is a reflection of the continued challenges black people face in the military. Just last year,\\xa0Protect Our Defenders, a nonprofit that deals with harassment and abuse in the military, produced a report about ongoing racial discrimination in the military. The report read(https://www.protectourdefenders.com/disparity/): > \"Military leadership has been aware of significant racial disparity in its justice process for years, and has made no apparent effort to find the cause of the disparity or remedy it. The leadership has vigorously opposed any suggestion that the commander-controlled justice system is hindered by conflicts of interest or bias and has gone to great lengths to tout the fairness of the system. However, the military 9s own data raises serious challenges to the idea that the system in its current form is capable of delivering impartial justice.\" And following the riots in Charlottesville, where white supremacists sought to protect memorials honoring Confederate generals that are largely seen as symbols of racial hatred, Washington Post military reporter Dan Lamothe wrote(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/08/18/after- charlottesville-the-u-s-military-grapples-with-its-history-of-racism-and- extremism/?utm_term=.a19274aa037e)\\xa0about\\xa0top military officials' concern about some service members and veterans joining right-wing extremist or white- supremacist groups, or acting out their ideologies. Trump was correct to note that blacks have been key figures in\\xa0the military since before the founding of America. But the way Trump spoke about the black American experience in the military honors the patriotism of black Americans in the military without addressing their ongoing challenges with racial discrimination. A more comprehensive understanding of the black American experience as it pertains to the military could lead the president to\\xa0understand why so many black Americans feel anger about his pitting the military against black Americans in his condemnation of NFL players. For these voters, pointing out racism isn't disrespectful to veterans. Instead, drawing attention to racism is meant to shed light on ongoing racial discrimination in the military. Trump\\xa0often evokes respect for the military when challenging Americans fighting discrimination and injustice in the country. But never does he address that challenges remain in the armed forces, as Foreign Policy's Thomas Ricks\\xa0wrote(http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/06/racial-inclusion-and- diversity-in-the-armed-forces-some-thoughts-on-today/): \"To believe racial discrimination ceases to exist in the military is a lie 4 and a dangerous one.\" If the president would like to see his approval ratings increase into the double digits with black voters, offering solutions to address the racial discrimination that many black voters\\xa0 4 veterans included\\xa0 4 could be an acceptable place to begin.

But when a number pops out that makes sense in terms of both theory and empirical evidence, it 9s legitimate to take note. In this spirit, note that the African American unemployment rate hit 6.8 percent last month, the lowest on record, with data going back to the early 1970s. In addition, the gap between black and white unemployment, measured as the black rate minus the white rate, hit 3.1 percentage points, also the lowest on record. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3bGe0uZzLfkclUZImDmVLvuqZ28=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OLQAXHYXHUY6HMRC2MDVOMFGVA.png)  Source: BLS Now, you may well be saying, cWait up; 6.8 percent doesn 9t sound all that low, especially given that the overall jobless rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. I agree. Where is it written that minority rates must be multiples of white rates? Some of the difference is due to educational differences, but not as much as you might think. Similar differentials in black/white jobless rates exist for all education levels. Racial discrimination is, of course, alive and well and in play in these gaps. But that key observation underscores my larger point:\\xa0A persistently strong macroeconomy is highly potent medicine for treating economic inequities, including racial ones. It 9s not all that 9s needed, by a very long shot. Purging discrimination and unequal punishment from the criminal justice, for example, is essential if we 9re ever to achieve racial justice. But it 9s not a coincidence that toward the end of his life, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was pushing hard on a full-employment agenda. The economics is straightforward. Discrimination 4 which doesn 9t have to be only racial discrimination; employers might discriminate against workers who 9ve, for example, been unemployed for a long time or have been out of the job market 4 is a cluxury that employers who engage in it can 9t afford when the economy tightens up. You either hire someone you might avoid if the labor supply queue was a lot longer, or you leave profits on the table. So, while we shouldn 9t get too excited about that relatively low monthly rate 4 given the high statistical variance in these data, it could jump back up next month 4 we should recognize and applaud these critical important macro-dynamics and the clear trends they 9re delivering, as seen in the figure above. In fact, rigorous research(https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017071pap.pdf) by Federal Reserve economists shows that black unemployment, along with the black/white gap is highly cyclical, meaning that what we 9re seeing here is what we 9d expect in year nine of an economic expansion with a labor market closing in on full employment. What about wage growth? In fact, not everything is totally rosy in the current job market. While wages are rising a bit faster than prices, their growth rate hasn 9t accelerated much at all, even as the job market has tightened up. I 9ve been observing and measuring this relationship for a long time, and I 9d expect to see more than we 9re getting on the wage side. The wage data for African American workers lags the job market data, so I can 9t speak to the racial wage story in real time. But I can share some hopeful indirect evidence. Using data on real (inflation-adjusted) median hourly wages for black workers, I asked how does the wage respond with the black-white unemployment gap closes. For every point of closure, the real black median wage goes up about a percent. That 9s not huge, but it 9s a move in the right direction. And the combination of more work at even slightly higher pay will raise black incomes and lower black poverty. Again, hold the applause: The strong macroeconomy is helping to achieve but a small piece of racial economic justice. These wage and job gaps remain far too large, and the opportunities facing black families, from kids to adults, are still much too constrained. But the policy implication is crystal clear: The longer this expansion proceeds, the better chance minority workers have of claiming some of its benefits. For the Federal Reserve, soon under the new leadership of Chair Jerome Powell, the message is this: Especially given that inflation remains tame and well below the Fed 9s target, keep your hands off that punch bowl!

The unemployment rate(https://www.cbsnews.com/news /economy-adds-modest-148000-jobs-in-december/) for African-Americans fell to 6.8 percent in December, the lowest level since the government began tracking such data in 1972.\\xa0 The reasons range from a greater number of black Americans with college degrees to a growing need for employers in a tight job market to widen the pool of people they hire from. \"The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News!\" President Donald Trump said in a tweet(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-himself-a-very-stable-genius- slams-michael-wolff/) Saturday.\\xa0  > The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8%, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And, in the Washington Post (of all places), headline states, cTrumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good. > > 4 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949608746497576960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)   Still, the rate for black workers remains well above those for whites and some other groups, something experts attribute in large part to decades of discrimination and disadvantages. Robust job creation has lowered unemployment for all Americans. U.S. employers added nearly 2.1 million jobs in 2017 -- the seventh straight year that hiring has topped 2 million. The U.S. economy gained a hefty 5.7 million jobs in 2014 and 2015 alone. But there are also less-happy reasons for the lower unemployment rates: Fewer Americans are either working or looking for work. (People who aren't actively seeking a job aren't counted as unemployed.) An aging population means there are more retirees. Young Americans are also staying in school longer before job-hunting. \\xa0 And some people, perhaps discouraged about their prospects, have given up looking for work and so aren't included in the unemployment rate. Here are some questions and answers about African-Americans' record-low unemployment rate:  Q. Given the record-low unemployment rates, if this the best job market ever for blacks?\\xa0 A. Not necessarily. As with nearly all demographic groups, a smaller proportion of blacks have jobs now than before the Great Recession, in part because of retirements, more people staying in school and discouraged would-be workers.\\xa0 The best job market for African-Americans might actually have been in 2000, when 61.4 percent of black adults were employed, the highest proportion ever. That figure fell below 52 percent in the depths of the recession, and is now 57.9 percent. The same pattern occurred for other groups. Two-thirds of Latinos were employed in 2000; now, only 62.5 percent are. About 65 percent of whites were working in 2000, far higher than the current 60.4 percent. (The data for Asians goes back only to 2003.)  Q. Why is the African-American unemployment rate higher than the rate for whites?   A. The main reason is discrimination, according to most research. Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy, notes that even when African-Americans have similar levels of education or experience, their chances of being unemployed are higher. \"That's what begs the question of what else could be the major reason,\" Wilson said. Nancy DiTomaso, a business professor at Rutgers University, says her research has found that whites likely benefit from networks of family and friends that don't intentionally exclude blacks or other minorities. Yet, nevertheless, their networks have the effect of helping whites get jobs more readily than blacks.  Q. What about other ethnic and racial groups?   A. Everyone is benefiting from the healthy job market. The unemployment rate for Latinos was 4.9 percent in December, just above the record low of 4.8 percent reached in June. And the jobless rate for Asians was 2.5 percent in December, just above the record low of 2.4 percent set in 2006.  Q. What factors have helped lower unemployment for African-Americans?   A. One major reason, Wilson says, is that many more black Americans are college graduates than in the past. That doesn't completely offset the effects of discrimination. But among all groups, college graduates have lower unemployment rates than those with less education. Another driver is economic: When the national unemployment rate falls to ultra-low levels, employers typically cast wider nets to find the workers they need. As they do so, they typically start pulling in more people from historically disadvantaged groups. These include job-seekers with less education as well as racial minorities. With the current U.S. unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, that appears to be what's happening. Some economists want the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising the short-term interest rate it controls for exactly this reason: Raising that rate could slow growth just as the benefits of the economy's expansion are spreading to disadvantaged groups.  Q. Where might the unemployment rate for African-Americans go from here?   A. It depends on the economy. Most economists expect healthy growth this year, fueled in part by the Trump administration's tax cuts for individuals and companies. That should lower unemployment for all Americans. The African-American unemployment rate is highly volatile and could rise or fall noticeably in the months ahead. It's down from 7.9 percent a year ago. Typically, the African-American unemployment rate is about twice the rate for whites and is more volatile. Wilson calculates that for each percentage-point change in the rate for whites, up or down, the rate for African-Americans will swing by about 1.6 points.\\xa0   ",

(Ghaith Abdul Ahad/Getty Images) NEW DELHI 4 In India, the rich and poor inhabit vastly different worlds. Now, many fear, new government rules will deepen that divide with \\xa0different-colored passports. On Friday, India 9s Foreign Ministry issued new rules saying that citizens who require emigration checks will now carry orange passports, while those who don 9t will carry blue ones. The new orange passports are supposed to protect vulnerable\\xa0laborers from exploitation abroad, but critics argue that the orange and blue color coding could lead to discrimination against poor and illiterate workers and effectively render millions of Indians second-class citizens. India is the world 9s largest exporter of migrant labor; 1 in 20(http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/03/india-is-a-top-source-and- destination-for-worlds-migrants/) migrant workers worldwide are Indian-born 4 a number that has rapidly risen in the past 25 years. Indian \\xe9migr\\xe9s sent home $69 billion in 2015, making their country the world 9s top recipient of remittances. But many of those who travel, especially those who provide cheap, unskilled labor, are very vulnerable to exploitation. In the past few years, scandals involving the Indian diaspora in Persian Gulf countries have shaken citizens. In 2016, Reuters reported(http://news.trust.org/item/20160503123246-dtg1p/) that 55-year-old Kasthuri Munirathinam, who worked as a housemaid in Saudi Arabia, became the face of migrant tragedy in the gulf after she described how her employer chopped her arm off in a fight that ended with her having to crawl out a second-floor apartment window. Saudi police at the time said(http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/saudi-police-try-to-shift- blame-on-indian-maid/article7771306.ece)\\xa0that Munirathinam 9s arm was amputated\\xa0because of\\xa0a fall and that she was\\xa0mentally ill. In Qatar, figures from the Indian Embassy in Doha showed that more than\\xa0500 Indians(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/qatar- world-cup-india-migrant-worker-deaths) died between 2012 and 2014. Human rights groups said(https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27 /thousands-qatar-world-cup-workers-life-threatening-heat)\\xa0construction workers had been subjected to squalid living conditions and were working in intense heat and humidity in preparation for soccer's 2022 World Cup. To protect workers, India requires unskilled migrants to get clearances from the Indian government before traveling to a number of countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Malaysia and Yemen. But people who have graduated high school, or the 2\\xa0percent of Indians who pay income tax, don 9t need to get clearances for travel, as skilled or educated\\xa0workers are less likely to be exploited abroad. Those who need emigration checks are identified on the last page of their passport. The new passport design, the Foreign Ministry said, would do away with the last page and instead use the colored covers to differentiate so that it will make it easier for immigration and law enforcement officers to spot travelers who require vetting before they travel to certain countries. The theory is this would also make human trafficking more difficult as border officials would immediately know which people need the extra permission to travel. India is one of the world's most unequal societies. Oxfam's India chief executive in 2017 said that just 57 billionaires control 70 percent(https://www.oxfamindia.org/newsclipping/1777) of the nation's wealth. Critics said the entire system of emigration clearance reinforces the divide between rich and poor. Nitin Pai, director of a Bangalore-based public policy think tank, criticized the new rules.  cHowever well-intentioned the move to create different colored passports for different kinds of travelers, it is wrong and must be reconsidered. Already officials treat citizens differently based on their class\\xa0\\u2026 different passport colors will worsen it, he wrote on Twitter. Oomen Chandy, former chief minister of the southern state of Kerala, said, cIf this becomes a reality, the moment an orange color passport holder lands in a foreign country, he will be treated with disdain, and it will have a telling impact on such people's character and individuality. This should not happen at all. **Read more:** Is India neglecting the Taj Mahal because it was built by Muslims?(https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/is-india-neglecting-its-iconic- taj-mahal-because-it-was-built-by-muslims/2017/10/03/61bd142e-fd2a-408f-b56b- b58916f0b290_story.html?utm_term=.36ac28aff85c) Officials turn to 8public shaming 9 to get people to use 52 million new toilets in India(https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india- turns-to-public-shaming-to-get-people-to-use-its-52million-new- toilets/2017/11/03/882166fe-b41c- 11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html?utm_term=.9855667d53eb) What are India 9s anti-Romeo squads?(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/22/yogi- adityanath-the-extremist-leader-in-india-launches-anti-romeo-squads-to- protect-women-is-it-moral-policing/?tid=a_mcntx&utm_term=.9b77300b42c3)  ",

Specialist staffing levels have dropped by 14% over seven years, despite a 31% rise in the number of children requiring support, says the Consortium for Research in Deaf Education (CRIDE). Almost 60% of existing specialist staff are due to retire within 15 years. Ministers say an extra \\xa3223m is being spent on special needs education. But the National Deaf Children's Society says there has been a \"dereliction of duty\".    Its CEO, Susan Daniels, urged the government to act: \"The evidence couldn't be clearer. From every angle and at every turn, a whole generation of deaf children will have their futures decimated if the Government doesn't act before it's too late.\" She added that despite deafness not being a learning disability, deaf children often fell \"a whole grade behind their hearing friends at school\".  * Welsh deaf pupils 'underachieve' at key stages(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39895438) The CRIDE survey of almost every authority in England found that more than a quarter of services employed one specialist teacher for every 80 students. In some areas there is one specialist teacher for every 100 students. The figures also revealed that a third of councils are struggling to recruit new specialist teaching staff.  Funding gap Responding to the CRIDE report, the Local Government Association warned that there had to be \"additional funding\" from the government to ensure councils meet their legal requirements towards students with additional needs. Last year, the LGA estimated that the shortfall in children's services budgets would reach \\xa32bn by 2020(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-39849120). State schools are expected to face a funding gap by the same year(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-39292344) according to Education Policy Institute analysis. Cllr Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: \"The recent Provisional Local Government Finance Settlement provided no new money for these vital services. The upcoming final settlement must urgently address this. \"If it doesn't, some councils may struggle to meet their statutory responsibilities.\" Despite the funding challenges, attainment among deaf students rose to a record high in 2015/16 with 47% achieving 5 A*- C GCSE grades. The government says it has committed \\xa3223m extra council funding to widespread special educational needs reforms in an effort to ensure deaf students \"get the support that is right for them\". Robert Goodwill, Minister of State for Children and Families, did not directly address the staffing shortages, but said \"most children who are deaf are able to attend their local schools while receiving expert advice, and for those with more complex needs there are specialist deaf schools.\"   ",

          "article": " WASHINGTON 4 After spending much of her life fighting for state and local control of education, Betsy DeVos last year found herself at the helm of the federal agency that she had long said stands in the way of educational innovation. , But after a year on the job, Ms. DeVos may have learned a hard lesson: local control means she can 9t always get what she wants. , Ms. DeVos this week upbraided state education chiefs, telling them that while she was obligated to approve their federally mandated state education plans, she was not happy about the way they have used their freedom under the new federal law that governs elementary and secondary education, known as the Every Student Succeeds Act. , If the states are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, Ms. DeVos isn 9t seeing much experimentation. But she refuses to violate her principles on states 9 rights and tell them what to do. ,  cESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs 4 including many in this room 4 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state 9s unique challenges, Ms. DeVos said in an address to the Council of Chief State School Officers. cWell, this law gives you that chance. The trouble, I don 9t see much evidence that you 9ve yet seized it. , It was the first time that Ms. DeVos has offered her opinions on the quality of state plans under the new law, which freed states from the punitive and prescriptive federal mandates of the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind Act. , But what Ms. DeVos called ctough love policy experts and observers called the ultimate display of a frustrated federalist. The address, they said, is an example of a self-described education reformer wrestling with the limits of her influence in an agency whose power she wants to curtail. ,  cI think she 9s having an identity problem, said Sandy Kress, who served as senior education adviser to Mr. Bush on the No Child Left Behind Act. , Mr. Kress noted that Ms. DeVos had been critical of her predecessors, calling Mr. Bush 9s education law a cstick, and Barack Obama 9s Race to the Top policy, which incentivized state reform with cash, a ccarrot. But he noted that she had not identified any tool that she would use to effect change in the nation 9s schools. ,  cBeing a federalist does not exclude you from the role of leadership, Mr. Kress said. cShe needs to stand for something, rather than showing up at a place like a regular citizen opining on things. , Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said he believed that not since the administration of the elder George Bush has an education secretary been a true federalist. That education secretary was Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is now a senator. As the chief architect of ESSA, he ensured the clocal control components of the bill. , George W. Bush 9s administration was so aggressive in driving education policy that Mr. Bush reset the expectation of conservative leadership in the department, Mr. Petrilli said. ,  cWe 9ve been conditioned for the last 30 years to expect a secretary of education to be out front on education reform, using various federal levers, he said. cBetsy DeVos is trying to lead from behind. , Ms. DeVos 9s criticism of the state plans echoed that of several groups that say her office 9s implementation of ESSA has been too lax. , Democrats and civil rights groups say Ms. DeVos has approved state education plans that do not properly measure the performance of minority students, an allegation she denies. But in her speech, she mentioned the fact that several governors(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/us/politics/betsy-devos- education-reform-governors-essa.html), the majority of them Republican, had refused to sign the plans their states submitted to her office because of what they saw as lackluster achievement goals. ,  cJust because a plan complies with the law doesn 9t mean it does what 9s best for students, Ms. DeVos told the chiefs. cWhatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won 9t pass muster around kitchen tables. , Education chiefs bristled at Ms. DeVos 9s assessments, which they saw as painting them with too broad a brush. ,  cAll states are doing far more than Sec. DeVos recognized, tweeted Matthew Blomstedt, the education commissioner in Nebraska, a state whose governor refused(http://understandingessa.org/nes-governor-says-he-wont- sign-states-essa-plan/) to sign its ESSA plan. cShe delivered a 8tough love 9 speech that demonstrated why the USDOE is out of touch with the good things actually happening in states and schools. , Policy experts agreed with the substance of the speech, but said it was too little, too late. ,  cShe should look in the mirror, said Chad Aldeman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners, a consulting firm that led a group of policy experts in an independent review of plans last year.(https://bellwethereducation.org/publication/independent-review-essa- state-plans) cThere were several points in time she could have shared her concerns and improved plans. , All plans have been submitted, and 35 have been approved. In announcing the batches of approvals, Ms. DeVos noted only that they complied with the law. , Ms. DeVos had signaled unwavering support for the autonomy under the ESSA law, and even issued a pared-down template for states to complete following a vote by Congress(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/every-student-succeeds-act- essa-congress.html) last year to rescind regulations that specified accountability measures in the law. But since then, she has not used much of her power over budgets, guidance documents or even a public relations campaign to promote opportunities for innovation and specificity under ESSA, critics say. ,  cShe lowered the bar, they met it, and now she seems frustrated by that, Mr. Aldeman said. , Ms. DeVos told state chiefs that they met the lowest bar 4 compliance 4 and that many plans fell short of furthering ESSA 9s primary goals of innovation in educational programming to lift student achievement, as well as increasing transparency about school performance. , For example, she said, only two states, Louisiana and New Mexico, opted into a program that allowed them to use millions in otherwise restricted federal dollars to provide new educational programs, like online courses, for struggling schools. , She also said that some states cproposed accountability schemes that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one. In one case, she said, a state ctook a simple concept like a color-coded dashboard and managed to make it nearly indecipherable. , In her speech, Ms. DeVos praised cbright spots, like Nevada, whose state education chief, Steve Canavero, said he was encouraged by the speech. ,  cThe core message I heard is a message that I continue to hear from the other folks who are in the bleachers of the education space: You have to continually think about ways to innovate, and think about ways to best serve kids, Mr. Canavero said. , Ms. DeVos reiterated that she would not fall into cthe trap of a top-down approach of her predecessors. ,  cThe Department of Education doesn 9t write laws, it implements them, she said. cCongress did its job. We 9re doing ours. And now, you get to do yours.  ",

        "article": " With backing from diehard supporters, Trump urged us to be outraged instead by the \"outlandish proposal\" made by lawmakers who visited him to discuss immigration. This rhetoric shouldn't deflect our attention from the fact that Trump has so debased his office that we are reduced to repeating his gutter language in order to address his unacceptable behavior. Many of us readily believe the reports of Trump's comment because we know him to be notoriously crude. For years he has displayed an obsession with race, ethnicity, religion and gender. When he was merely a bragging businessman, his relentless effort to alienate us from each other could be dismissed as a private citizen's character flaw -- of less consequence because he was essentially a showman and a hype artist. When he stepped into the national political arena, and continued this kind of talk, he became a more dangerously divisive figure who threatened the norms that make America the agreeable, noisy, diverse, and creative country the world admires. !The problem isn&39;t Trump&39;s brain.

It's his heart(/2018/01/10/opinions/the- problem-isnt-trumps-brain-but-his-heart-opinion-dantonio/index.html) During the presidential campaign, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge hearing the fraud complaints against his defunct Trump \"University\" should disqualify himself because he is of Mexican descent. \"I'm building a wall,\" said Trump, referring to his call for a huge border wall between the US and Mexico, so the judge has \"an inherent conflict of interest.\" Trump defended the comments in an interview(http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/03/politics/donald-trump-tapper- lead/index.html) with CNN's Jake Tapper, saying: \"He's proud of his heritage. I respect him for that,\" yet adding, \"He's a Mexican.\" In fact, the judge was born in the United States. It is, of course, only human for us to feel anxiety about people who may be different from us. The tendency to categorize others is a well-established element of human nature. But it is also human to seek to work against our prejudices and to understand that others always deserve respect.  Swedish, not German? For at least four decades, Trump has aired rather strange views about heritage and identity. As a young man, he repeated his father Fred's false claim that the Trump family -- the name was once Drumpf -- emigrated from Sweden, and not Germany. The senior Trump began calling himself Swedish after World War II because, as Donald Trump told me, he didn't want Jewish New Yorkers to connect him with the Nazi regime and take their business elsewhere. This assumption, which Donald agreed with, betrays an exceedingly dim view of human nature. The Trumps expected bigotry from Jewish New Yorkers and they were willing to turn their backs on their ancestors to make money. As Donald Trump moved through his adult life, he has regularly demonstrated an extraordinary level of concern about the ethnic and racial identity of people he encountered. When he testified before a committee in Congress about competing casino operators from Native American tribes, he complained, out loud, that they \"don't look like Indians to me.\" In his book about Trump's years as a casino operator in Atlantic City, former Trump executive John R. O'Donnell wrote(http://fair.org/take-action/media- advisories/ignoring-trumps-record-of-racism/) of how his boss made bigoted statements about African-Americans and Jews. O'Donnell quoted Trump saying: \"Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes... Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else ... Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that's guy's lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks.\" !Trump&39;s outrageous remark shows his affinity for the worst of America&39;s past(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Trump&39;s outrageous remark shows his affinity for the worst of America&39;s past(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180105145633-01-trump-0104-large-169.jpg)(/2018/01/11/opinions /trump-shithole-immigration-remarks-reveal-instincts-ghitis- opinion/index.html) Trump's outrageous remark shows his affinity for the worst of America's past(/2018/01/11/opinions/trump-shithole-immigration-remarks-reveal- instincts-ghitis-opinion/index.html) Trump has both confirmed and denied the accuracy of O'Donnell's reporting. In May 1997, he told Playboy writer Mark Bowden about the book generally, \"The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true.\" Two years later, when he was eying a third-party run for president he told Tim Russert, \"I've never said anything like it.\"  Fair housing case Prior to Trump's involvement in gambling, his real estate organization was subject to a crackdown by the US government for failing to comply with fair housing laws governing applications for apartments by minorities. Trump answered with a countersuit in which his lawyer likened the feds to the \"Gestapo\" and \"storm troopers.\" The countersuit was dismissed by the judge in the case. In the end, Trump settled(https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments- racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23 /fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html?utm_term=.48734a47bd3d) the case by agreeing to comply with the law and without admitting wrongdoing. In 1989, he was back in the press again, telling(https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/the-absolute- trumpest-121328) Bryant Gumbel that, \"A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market.\" Foreigners have also come in for Trump's prejudice on a regular basis. In the 1980s it was the Japanese who secretly \"laugh like hell\" after completing unfair business deals. Now it's the Chinese, whom Trump mocks(http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-mocks-asians- broken-english-speech-article-1.2338344) by speaking broken English, but also offers as the wily, if not sneaky, bargainers who take advantage of America.  Leader of the birthers For much of President Obama's presidency, Trump led the so-called \"birther\" movement, alleging, in ridiculous defiance of all evidence, that Obama was born outside the US and may not be a real American citizen. This campaign, which he pursued long after others dropped it, was clearly an attempt to turn the first African-American president into a foreign \"other\" and thus, presumably, render him illegitimate. When comedian Jon Stewart went after him on his satirical nightly broadcast, Trump reached once again for an argument based on ethnicity. He tweeted:(https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/330360556362018816) \"If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz. He should be proud of his heritage!\" This from a German- American man who had posed as Swedish. Trump started off his run for the presidency with a bigoted rant about undocumented Mexicans, braying about how \"they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" The effect of this talk was to ramp up public anxieties about people who are actually less likely to commit crimes than others. A pair of Massachusetts men were arrested for beating a Latino person they encountered on the street and, according to police, one of them said, \"Donald Trump was right.\" Next, Trump retweeted false \"data\" alleging that black assailants account for more than 80% of white deaths due to homicide. The numbers were too high by a factor of five.(http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald- trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/) And don't forget Donald Trump's attitudes about the 1.5 billion Muslims of this world. One of his first acts as president was to establish a travel ban, which has since been modified, that targeted citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.  Dividing Americans Trump's divisive view of people is a deeply felt belief that he has passed on to the younger generation of Trumps. His eldest son Donald Jr. told me that, \"Like him Donald Sr., I'm a big believer in race-horse theory. He's an incredibly accomplished guy, my mother's incredibly accomplished, she's an Olympian, so I'd like to believe genetically I'm predisposed to better-than- average.\" In Trump's world, comments about a person's ethnic and racial background are fair game. And yet he says(http://fox6now.com/2015/12/09/donald-trump-in- cnn-interview-i-am-the-least-racist-person-that-you-have-ever-met/), \"I am the least racist person you have ever met.\" Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Trump's kind of thinking was common in the 1950s, when he was a boy. This is the period evoked when he says he wants to \"Make America Great Again.\" In fact, the 1950s were marred in many ways, including by the stereotypes people clung to about group identity. Thankfully, most Americans grew beyond this type of thinking and learned to consider people as individuals and view character as paramount. What's most worrying about Trump is the evidence that he has not joined the rest of us.  ",

        "article": " MINNEAPOLIS 4 When Erin Rathke, the principal at Justice Page Middle School, is called to extract a student from class, she hears the same plea over and over again, most often, she has to admit, from black children: cThe teacher only sees me. , The plea weighs heavily at Justice Page, where African-American students are 338 percent more likely to be suspended than their white peers. cIt 9s painful sometimes, but I have to say, 8Yes, that 9s probably true, 9 Ms. Rathke said. , It is a reality that district leaders here have been grappling with for years: The Minneapolis school district suspends an inordinate number of black students compared with white ones, and it is struggling to figure out why. Last year, districtwide, black students were 41 percent of the overall student population, but made up 76 percent of the suspensions. , Numbers like that prompted the Obama administration in 2014 to draft tough new policies to try to address racial disparities in school discipline across the country. Now, the Trump administration is trying to reverse those policies 4 in part, administration officials say, as a response to school shootings like the massacre last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. , The Obama-era policies 4 and the Trump-era reversals 4 have divided educators in the Twin Cities. In recent months, educators from Minneapolis, St. Paul and suburban Minnesota traveled to Washington to lobby the Education Department in support of reversing the 2014 guidelines, which encouraged school districts to review racial disparities in student discipline rates to ensure against violations of federal civil rights laws. Those that do not comply can face federal investigation or a loss of funding. , Then another group followed them to lobby for keeping the guidance. , A retired Minnesota teacher set off a conservative media blitz(http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/02/teacher-coalition- seeks-to-end-obama-school-discipline-policy-a-lot-of-fear-in-schools/) by linking the Obama-era guidance to frustrations that teachers have with violent students, raising the issue high enough for the White House to latch on after the Parkland massacre. The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement. , Debbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News(http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/14/ann-coulter-secret- debate-tip-gop/) article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident. ,  **ALSO READ** : How Effective is Your School District?(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/upshot/a-better-way- to-compare-public- schools.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article) , The story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers 9 authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed. ,  cIt 9s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy, Ms. York said. , Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance. , Civil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system. , In a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would cvery likely substantiate claims of a persistent inequality in the ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities. ,  cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance, Mr. Scott wrote. , But in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators 9 perception of both. ,  cWe 9re in a pressure cooker, said Michael Thomas, the district 9s chief of schools. cAnd what 9s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what 9s happening across America. , While critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue(http://educationnext.org/supposed-discipline-fix-threatens-school- cultures-forum-petrilli/) that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start. , Bernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included cgifted but can 9t use his words and chigh strung, with their actions excused because they chad a hard day. , Black children, she said, were cdestructive and cviolent, and ccannot be managed. ,  cWhen you see something like that and you 9re a leader, and you 9re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward 4 it was alarming, Ms. Johnson said. ,  **ALSO READ** : Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white- and-black-men.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article) , Nationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state 9s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation(https://wallethub.com/edu /states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-financial-gaps-by-race/9842/). , Last month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices. ,  cWe 9re at a tipping point, and that 9s what you see in the schools said Kevin Lindsey, the state 9s human rights commissioner. , The school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation. ,  cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably, Mr. Thomas said. cWe 9re still adjusting our listening frequency. , But some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student 9s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad(http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-teen-faces-sentencing-for-attack- on-teacher-at-central-high/364220771/). Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials(https://www.twincities.com/2017/11/17/battered-st-paul-teacher- meeting-with-trump-officials-over-school-discipline/) to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies. , Simon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district 9s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as ccultural dialect, he said. ,  cIt threw the school into complete chaos, he said. cThe kids knew they weren 9t going to go home. , Mr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word cdetention, but rather cquality time. Eventually, he would just csweep a lot under the rug. , The discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years 4 a warning, then a consequence 4 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist. ,  cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students, he said. cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist. , The root of those changes was in the district 9s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department 9s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices. , Federal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher 9s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days. , Ms. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses. , The policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter(http://www.newamericancivilrightsproject.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/03/Minneapolis-school-discipline-letter.pdf), Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move clegally and constitutionally suspect. He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline. , One month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned. ,  cWhen people have kids around them that don 9t look like them, they want them controlled, she said. , The district 9s agreement(https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us- education-department-reaches-voluntary-resolution-agreement-following- minneapolis-public-school-district-discipline-investigation) with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies. , There are bright spots. , At Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a cloaded term, said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data 4 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year 4 showed that the school was a chealthy place that emphasized positive reinforcement. , When it comes to misbehavior, cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that 9s wrong with them, he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it 9s our job to figure out why. , But, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended. , Justice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course. , Fresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools. , The school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body. ,  cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day, she said. cSome teachers aren 9t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we 9re not going to give up on students, and I 9m not going to give up on them. , There are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to(http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-middle-school-renamed-out-with- alexander-ramsey-in-with-justice-page/428452213/) rename the school for the state 9s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota 9s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes. ,  cWe are more than these numbers, Ms. Rathke said. cBut they 9re telling us something: We have students that we just haven 9t figured out how to support yet.

Councils will instead have to create a database to identify children not on a school register under plans to revamp home education. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams is due to give a statement on Tuesday. She will also announce plans for a \"comprehensive package of support\" for home educators, including exams help. The plans are for statutory guidance - compared with the non-statutory guidance(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-38603771) published a year ago, which Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, described at the time as \"disappointing\".    She called Tuesday's announcement a \"step in the right direction\". Councils do not need to be told if a child is home educated, unless they are removed from school. The new plans will not change that but will require councils to create a \"reasonably complete\" database so they can identify children who are not on a school register. Ms Williams will consult on how the database will be managed and look at which partners - such as health boards - will be able to contribute to it and whether independent schools should be required to tell councils about pupils in their schools.   * 'I should be home-schooled but I spent 10 months on Xbox'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-41476718)   * Why I home-educate my daughter(/news/education-42103248)   * Kids enjoy special play time(http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/42852581)   * Home school worry after scurvy death(/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35380182)   Image copyrightWales News ServiceImage caption The CPS decided not to pursue its case of neglect against Dylan Seabridge's parents Glynn and Julie  Ms Holland and NSPCC Cymru both called for a compulsory register of home educated children after Dylan Seabridge - a home-educated eight-year-old - died of scurvy(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35380182) in Pembrokeshire in 2011. A report by the National Independent Safeguarding Board recommended the same thing. Instead, these new plans will outline the arrangements local authorities will be expected to put in place to identify home-educated children and assess the suitability of education. Support for home educators will include help with exam registrations, the same health offers made to children in school, making the Hwb online learning portal(https://hwb.gov.wales/) available and support from Careers Wales. Ms Williams said: \"There are many valid, different and sometimes complex reasons why parents would choose to go down this route and in some cases this will be the best choice for the child. \"But this choice must be balanced with the right of children to receive a suitable education. \"Local authorities, by establishing a database supported by statutory guidance, will be able to assess whether a child is receiving a suitable education and, if they are educated at home, that home educators have the support they need.\" Ms Holland said she was pleased to see a \"step in the right direction\", adding: \"In reality it means there'll be a statutory requirement for local authorities to know who is being home educated and what those children are being taught.\" The NSPCC said a compulsory register would help to ensure children did not become \"invisible to authorities, adding: \"Greater support for home educators and steps to improve data are welcome but we would like to see the Welsh Government go further.\"   ",

(Patrick Semansky/AP) Did Education Secretary Betsy DeVos just trash America 9s higher education system? Here, among other things, is what DeVos said on Thursday about America 9s higher education system 4 still widely seen as the world 9s best despite enormous challenges 4 during an address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors at its winter meeting in Washington: > And you have the power to convene local efforts with business leaders, entrepreneurial educators, parents and students. You can help broaden horizons and encourage everyone to embrace multiple pathways to success after high school. > > I 9m reminded of a recent conversation I had with the Israeli ambassador to the United States. He posed a rather provocative question: cWhy hasn 9t America 9s higher ed bubble burst? He was baffled as to why America 9s businesses haven 9t simply stepped in to create their own education programs to equip individuals with the necessary skills, instead of relying on others to get it right for them. In many other parts of the world, employers and educators work hand-in-hand to line up the skills required with those actually taught. > > When it comes to higher education, too many implicitly or explicitly suggest there is only one path to success. That must stop! Her speech struck some familiar themes: public education hasn 9t changed much since the 1800s and solutions to improve education cannot come from the federal government. She also urged businesses to become more involved in training Americans for jobs, saying the higher education system in America is not getting the job done. That sentiment underpins an important debate about the purpose of higher education, highlighted when Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) in 2015 quietly tried to change(http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer- sheet/wp/2015/02/05/how-gov-walker-tried-to-quietly-change-the-mission-of-the- university-of-wisconsin/) the University of Wisconsin system 9s century- old mission. He proposed removing words in the state code that command the university to csearch for truth and cimprove the human condition and replace them with cmeet the state 9s workforce needs. DeVos has been on the Walker side of the argument, arguing that higher education institutions are not preparing students to meet 21st century needs.  cThere is a fundamental disconnect between education and the economy, she said in her Thursday speech. cFar too many students are simply unprepared. It 9s worth noting that such a level of unpreparedness apparently hasn 9t stopped the economy from growing during the Trump administration. Perhaps the link between the economy and education is not as strong as many say, or if it is, perhaps America 9s schools are better than given credit for being (which isn 9t to say that many aren 9t troubled). _ U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent rate, a win for Trump (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/27/u-s-economy-grew-3 -percent-from-july-to-september-meeting-trumps-goal/?utm_term=.7271fcdf36a5)_ She also said that cacross states and industries, there are 6 million job openings, as the 8blue collar 9 jobs of yesterday become the 8blue tech 9 jobs of today. Actually, the suggestion that 6 million jobs are open because Americans are unqualified to do all of them is not true, according to this Washington Post story from 2017(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/08/there- are-7-million-unemployed-and-6-2-million-job-openings-whats-the- problem/?utm_term=.d59b014a7a14), which said there are a number of reasons for the openings, including that many employers don 9t pay enough and that many of the jobs are low-skilled. It also said: > It 9s telling that 5 of the 10 jobs(https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_104.htm) the U.S. government projects will grow the fastest over the next decade pay less than $25,000 a year. The jobs have titles such as personal care aide, home health aide and food preparer.\\xa0It 9s a vicious cycle: Companies don 9t pay enough. Then they complain workers aren 9t dedicated and loyal. _ There are 7 million unemployed and 6.2 million job openings. What 9s the problem?

And thank you for your leadership on the Conference 9s Jobs, Education and Workforce Committee. I 9m honored to be here today with this group of city leaders and I know each of your communities is deeply interested in the work you do here and what we 9ll discuss today. > > Yours are perhaps the most hands-on jobs in public service. You serve people directly . . . when the snow needs plowing, the garbage needs collecting or the lights need fixing, you are the first line of contact. > > The people you all serve are interested in solutions. And I must say, I 9ve always believed solutions are best developed by those closest to the issue 4 by states, by your cities, by families. > > In education, we 9ve seen valiant efforts at reform from Republicans and Democrats, liberals, conservatives and everyone in between. > > Education is not and should not be a partisan issue. Because everyone is aiming for the same result. > > Everyone wants students to be prepared and to lead successful lives. > > We can 9t say that sort of public harmony exists in other policy arenas. Not everyone agrees about the outcome or goal of tax policy or energy policy or immigration policy. > > Our unity of purpose here presents an opportunity. > > Parents know that we need solutions for today 9s education problems. And they recognize how little education has changed since they were students. > > Does this sound familiar to anyone? Students lined up in rows. A teacher up front, framed by a blackboard (or perhaps a csmartboard today). Sit down; don 9t talk; eyes front. Wait for the bell. Walk to the next class. And . . . repeat. > > That 9s what it was like for me, and I bet it was true for many 4 if not all 4 of you, too. In fact, it hasn 9t changed much since the 1800s. It 9s no wonder many employers are hard-pressed to find employees with 21st century skills when they 9re being taught in a 19th century model. > > Today, across states and industries, there are 6 million job openings, as the cblue collar jobs of yesterday become the cblue tech jobs of today. Coding is as common and necessary a skill today as riveting or stamping was a few decades back.

You know what kinds of people are needed for the new plant or enterprise that is opening or expanding in your city. And you probably know a few folks who, with additional education, could thrive in some of those jobs. > > We need more of a collaborative spirit. We need more opportunities to come together and find solutions. And let me be clear: those solutions won 9t originate in Washington, D.C. For too long, people in D.C. have acted like they have all the answers 4 and they still try to. > > But Washington should focus less on trying to tell cities and states what to do, and instead focus on convening people who are actually getting it done in cities and states. To, in turn, share what works broadly for others to emulate or improve upon. > > To that end, I 9m pleased to co-chair a task force on apprenticeships with Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta with the goal of bringing together institutions of higher education, schools and businesses to spark discussion 4 and ultimately action on local levels. > > And you have the power to convene local efforts with business leaders, entrepreneurial educators, parents and students.

The technology industry 9s crackdown against users accused of chate speech after August 9s cUnite the Right rally in Charlottesville has fueled allegations of political bias against\\xa0companies that are playing a crucial role is disseminating speech worldwide. _ Read Damore's suit (https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6p02fijxrd7c6m/20180108%20Damore%20-%20Complaint_fs.pdf?dl=0)_ The suit by Damore, filed in Santa Clara, Calif., alleges discrimination by Google against men, people of the cCaucasian race, and people with perceived conservative political views.\\xa0 The suit says that Google employees who expressed views deviating from the majority at Google on politics or on employment practices, including cdiversity hiring policies, bias sensitivity, and social justice, were csingled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated from Google, in violation of their legal rights. Damore 9s fellow plaintiff in the class action is another Google employee, a former software engineer named David Gudeman. Google fired Damore after he\\xa0wrote a 10-page memo\\xa0 titled cGoogle 9s Ideological Echo Chamber: How bias clouds our thinking about diversity and inclusion. Though initially circulated internally in July, it reached a wide audience in August when Motherboard published the memo, saying the canti-diversity memo had gone cinternally viral d(https://motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees- anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at- google?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=amp&utm_source=motherboard.vice.com- RelayMediaAMP)\\xa0at the Mountain View, Calif.-based technology company.\\xa0The memo said that cgenetic differences may explain cwhy we don 9t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. The company, which called the memo coffensive and charmful, soon fired Damore, further elevating him in the eyes of his supporters as a victim of what\\xa0they called an overreaching cpolitical correctness and ideology rigidity within the tech industry. Damore, who also filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, appeared to embrace his rising political visibility, posing in a T-shirt with the word cGoolag written in a multicolored style that mimicked Google 9s familiar logo. Google spokesman, Ty Sheppard, said in response to the lawsuit: cWe look forward to defending against Mr. Damore 9s lawsuit in court. At a\\xa0news conference, Damore 9s lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, said her client had attended various company meetings and discussions dedicated to diversity. At one such event on campus, Damore had questioned human resources staff about whether political bias was included in the company 9s diversity hiring goals, and was told it wasn 9t. He was asked to contribute feedback after the event, which led him to write his memo. Before the memo went public, he said he had received feedback from nearly 200 different Google employees, including human resources staff, over the course of several weeks. That gave Damore the impression that he was having an open discussion with colleagues, and he did not realize he was in trouble until 48 hours before he was let go. Damore 9s legal complaint\\xa0filled over 200 pages and included screenshots of emails and other correspondence between Damore and Google employees, and anonymous complaints from current Google employees who hold conservative viewpoints. One screenshot showed an email from a Google engineer who wrote Damore, cYou 9re a misogynist and a terrible human. I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired. Another screenshot shows how a Google employee received a so-called peer bonus 4 in which a colleague can recommend another colleague for a bonus 4 for speaking out against the values in Damore 9s memo. The complaint described another Google event, the company 9s weekly call-hands, in which Google executives cshamed teams that did not have 50 percent women on staff.  cThere 9s a Lord of the Flies mentality there, said Dhillon. cWhere a person can be singled out, shamed, and fired. Dhillon is a prominent Republican in California who was reportedly considered for a Justice Department position in the Trump administration. She recently represented Republican students at the University of California at Berkeley who sued their school to allow conservative media personality Ann Coulter to speak there on a specific day. (The school had rescheduled Coulter 9s event\\xa0because of\\xa0security concerns). At the\\xa0news conference, held in Dhillon 9s office in San Francisco office, Damore was asked whether he was a Trump supporter. He declined to answer. Later on Monday, Johnson\\xa0sued\\xa0Twitter for allegedly violating his right to free speech by permanently suspending his account(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/05/26 /charles-johnson-one-of-the-internets-most-infamous-trolls-has-finally-been- banned-from-twitter/?utm_term=.38c92fd71720)\\xa0after a tweet in which he\\xa0sought to raise money for ctaking out a Black Lives Matter activist. Johnson filed the suit in state superior court in San Francisco, where Twitter is headquartered. He has long maintained that he was seeking not violence but an investigation that might damage the public standing of the activist, DeRay McKesson. Johnson asserted in the suit that Twitter 9s real motivation in banning him was to quash conservative voices online and that the company failed to follow its own cvague and subjective rules for suspending user accounts. The suit calls Twitter cthe modern public square, and says, cLike the company towns of old, it is a privately-owned public square. And therein lies the danger. Twitter declined to comment on the suit Monday. Like many other technology companies, it has long portrayed itself as a bastion of free speech and said it has acted to block users only after they violate the company 9s terms of service, including bans on hateful speech or speech intended to incite violence against people or groups. Johnson, often described as cright-wing troll for his aggressive investigations and online tactics, cites in his suit internal Twitter emails published in December by BuzzFeed(https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel /internal-emails-show-twitter-struggled-to-interpret-its- own?utm_term=.my6xOeGnx.dkdXb4D2X) that appear to demonstrate uncertainty over how to handle Johnson. An email cited by the article says that Johnson was personally banned by Richard Costolo, Twitter 9s chief executive at the time. An email that BuzzFeed said came from Costolo said, cTo be very clear, I don 9t want to find out we unsuspended this Chuck Johnson troll later on. . . . That account is permanently suspended and nobody for no reason may reactivate it. Johnson operates two sites, GotNews and WeSearchr, that often have sparked controversy. WeSearchr raises money, called cbounties, for information and causes that often have a sharply political cast, including money to help defend a neo-Nazi website called the Daily Stormer against a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Twitter has banned Johnson personally and the accounts for GotNews and WeSearchr. GotNews is a co- plaintiff in the suit, along with Johnson.  cTwitter is silencing conversation on the right-of-center perspectives, Johnson said in an interview. cThis has been the standing playbook of how tech companies deal with voices that come from groups they don 9t like. The American legal system has long given wide latitude to technology companies and the manner in which they choose to enforce their terms of service. But the suit makes particular reference to the California\\xa0state constitution 9s guarantee of free speech. Courts in that state have in the past\\xa0highlighted the importance of\\xa0free speech rights even when exercised on private property, making the state potentially more amenable to Johnson 9s claims about censorship on a private online platform such as Twitter, said Jonathan Zittrain, faculty director of Harvard 9s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.  cOf all the places to bring a long-shot case like this, California would be the place, Zittrain said. He added that technology companies, because of their crucial role in airing constitutionally protected speech, need to have rigorous and transparent procedures for deciding when to suspend users.  ",

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) For 43 years, schoolkids and their parents have clipped the labels from cookie bags and cracker boxes as part of a popular rewards program called Labels for Education. Through this and similar programs 4 think Tyson 9s Project A+ or General Mills 9 Box Tops for Education 4 schools get cash and supplies in exchange for clipped labels from participating food items. But these programs, most of which are wildly popular at U.S. schools, may have major downsides for students. Critics say they are designed to sell junk food to children too young to make good health decisions. Just this month, as Labels for Education wound down 4 a result of declining participation, said its parent company, Campbell 9s 4 public health advocates cheered the end of a program widely beloved by teachers, schools and parents. It included snack foods, such as cookies and crackers, that many health advocates say should be discouraged.  cIt 9s just another form of junk-food marketing to kids, said Colin Schwartz, a senior nutrition policy associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, one of several groups that has celebrated the demise of Labels for Education. cWe 9re glad to see Campbell 9s ending its program, and we 9re calling on other companies to take the same step. Besides Campbell 9s, two other companies dominate school rewards: General Mills and, to a far lesser extent,\\xa0Tyson.\\xa0Each company awards schools a set amount of money 4 roughly 5 to 38 cents 4 for each purchase code or label collected from participating products. Those products carry a distinctive logo\\xa0on the front of the box or bag. Schools publicize that logo to parents via conferences and meetings, as well as through materials sent home with their kids. Many schools also promote rewards programs directly to students, holding contests(https://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/805-labels-and- box-tops-collect-more-when-kids-compete) and constructing bulletin boards(https://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/806-box-tops- champs-share-collection-tricks) to encourage them to bring more labels in. Once the labels are collected, schools exchange them for cash or supplies, ranging from pencils and markers to playground equipment. The average payout is modest 4 $750 per school per year, in the case of General Mills 4 but that can go a long way at some schools, program participants say. At Glover Community Learning Center, a small, low-income elementary school in Akron, Ohio, money from Box Tops and Labels for Education has bought jump ropes, gym balls, pencil sharpeners, paintbrushes, markers and an insulated water cooler.  cWe 9re a small school, and these programs are a big help, said Kia Strickling, the president of the school 9s parent-teacher association. cThe alternative is teachers buying basic supplies out of their own pockets. Critics don 9t object to schools getting much-needed funds. But they do protest the nutritional quality of the foods in rewards programs and schools' role in promoting them, which potentially undermines nutrition education and could boost kids 9 lifelong taste for unhealthy foods. Campbell 9s, which also owns brands such as SpaghettiOs and Pepperidge Farm, has slapped the Labels for Education logo on frozen desserts and queso dip. Tyson 9s Project A+\\xa0includes salty chicken nuggets. When it comes to Box Tops, by far the most popular of the programs, a recent study(https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2017/08/29/box-tops-foods- smart-snacks-standards/)\\xa0by researchers at Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health and MassGeneral Hospital for Children\\xa0found that two- thirds of the products bearing the Box Tops label do not meet federal nutrition requirements for sale in schools.  cThe vast majority of these products can't be sold in schools, so they shouldn't be advertised in schools, Schwartz said. Food companies point out that their rewards labels appear on healthier foods, too, such as vegetable soups and juices, in the case of Campbell 9s, or yogurt and Cheerios, in the case of General Mills. And they argue that, even if the labels sometimes appear on unhealthy foods, the program is designed to appeal to the parents making shopping decisions, not their school-age children. All\\xa0three companies have strict policies on marketing to kids.  cThe Labels for Education program 9s marketing is directed to adult coordinators and parents, not to kids, Campbell 9s said in a statement.  cBox Tops for Education is NOT a brand marketing program, echoed General Mills spokeswoman Mollie Wulff in an email. cIt is a fundraising program for parents and a way for General Mills to support local communities and schools. But for critics, this is another point of contention: Children are often highly involved in rewards programs, they say, and schools often advertise the programs directly to them. At Strickling 9s school in Akron, the PTA holds contests to see which classroom can collect the most labels and awards a pizza party to the winner. That type of in-school promotion can cause children to develop positive associations with both the labels and the products they appear on, said Jennifer Harris, a researcher at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. Those associations can be difficult to overwrite once they are established.  cThere 9s a reason companies want to get kids when they 9re really young, said Harris. cWhen aimed at children, whose minds are still developing, marketing can create lifelong preferences and habits that contribute to obesity and other conditions. Critics have proposed excluding from the rewards programs any product that doesn 9t meet the Department of Agriculture 9s minimum nutrition guidelines for in-school sales. Schools could also work harder to cut students out of rewards programs by promoting them directly, and only, to parents, critics said. Many public health advocates would like to see schools withdraw from these programs entirely. But that is unlikely, said Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado 9s National Education Policy Center, because many schools have grown accustomed to the payouts to supplement decreased public funds. With the exception of Campbell 9s Labels for Education, rewards programs remain highly popular.  cThere are no good solutions for schools, said Boninger, who opposes the programs. cSchools don 9t have the money they need, which is why they resort to these food company handouts. At the Glover school in Akron, Strickling says she thinks cgood solutions are indeed running out. Funding has dwindled for art and gym classes at the school, she said, a result of districtwide budget cuts. The end of Labels for Education was a blow. Now Strickling is doubling down on General Mills 9 Box Tops for Education, with a wary eye on the public health advocates calling for the program to end. She doesn 9t think rewards programs market to children.  cI really disagree with that, she said. cParents have to choose healthy snacks. If I buy Froot Loops when Nature Valley has the label 4 you can 9t blame the school or the company for that. **Read more:** How to fix the American diet, according to the man who coined the term 'junk food'(http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2017/12/28/how-to-fix- the-american-diet-according-to-the-man-who-coined-the-phrase-junk-food/) Food-makers are taking salt and sugar out of food.

        "article": " THAT African Americans are poorer than the American average is well- established. In 2016, the median household income of black Americans was $39,500 compared with $65,000 for non-Hispanic white Americans. Lower parental income and education levels are often cited as reasons for this gap. But a new paper suggests that there is more to it than that. It finds that black men fare worse economically than white men even if they are raised in households with similar incomes and educated similarly. A black boy brought up in a wealthy family is as likely to become poor in adulthood as he is to remain prosperous. The study(http://www.equality-of- opportunity.org/assets/documents/race_paper.pdf), by Raj Chetty at NBER, Maggie Jones at the Census Bureau and two colleagues is notable for its size and sweep: it involves 20m people born between 1978 and 1983 3about 94% of all of those born over that period now resident in America. The authors use a range of data on child, parental and neighbourhood characteristics to look at the impact of race on economic mobility over a generation.  **Get our daily newsletter** Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Black women, by contrast, seem to have slightly more upward mobility than white women. In terms of high-school completion, college attendance, incarceration rates, hours worked and employment rates black women also look indistinguishable from white women raised in households with similar incomes. Black men see worse outcomes on all of these measures than both white men and black women. In terms of earnings it appears black women from poor families primarily face barriers because of poverty and gender, while black men from those families face barriers because of poverty and race.\\xa0 The paper 9s authors dismiss some frequently cited explanations for the mobility gap. They find that the impact of growing up in a single-parent home or one with less-educated parents on upward mobility is muted. And while neighbourhoods matter to incomes, they have little impact on the mobility gap, which is present within and across nearly all of the 28,850 neighbourhoods in the study. Among children with parents earning at the 25th percentile, black boys had lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of the neighbourhoods. School and housing integration may not help if the mobility gap persists even among children raised on the same block, going to the same school.\\xa0 The researchers note that in low-poverty neighbourhoods two things do improve black boys 9 prospects and close the black-white gap: clow levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks d. The presence of fathers seems to make a difference to a boy regardless of whether his own father is present, suggesting that other fathers can act as role models and mentors. The researchers point out that few black children grow up in such places. Fewer than 5% of black children grow up in areas with a poverty rate lower than 10% and more than half of black fathers present. By comparison, 63% of white children grow up in areas with such conditions. In all this, it is hard to ignore the role the criminal-justice system plays in the lives of black males. Black drivers are three times more likely than white drivers to have their car searched by police after a stop, blacks are arrested twice as often as whites for drug crimes despite similar usage rates, they are more often offered plea deals which involve jail time for similar crimes, and black males in particular are given longer sentences for the same crime.\\xa0 Once they leave jail, black men face greater barriers with re-integration. Devah Pager from Princeton University and colleagues sent teams of black and white men to apply for jobs in New York, presenting equivalent resum\\xe9s differing only in race and criminal background. They found a significant negative effect of a criminal record on employment outcomes that was substantially larger for African Americans. This evidence of discrimination in criminal justice can go some way towards explaining the results of the latest research. The overall incarceration rate for black men in its sample is 10.3% compared with 1.6% for white men and 0.6% for black women. That suggests an inter-generational impact of high rates of father incarceration on outcomes for boys. Other studies have found that schools with high levels of incarceration among parents produce worse educational outcomes for children.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 To the extent that incarceration is one factor behind the income gap between white and black American men, there is some good news: prison populations have been falling. There has been a 17% decline in the number of black inmates in state and federal prisons between 2009 and 2016, outpacing the overall decline in incarceration rates.

        "article": "  When California employment lawyer Dawn Knepper(https://ogletree.com/people/dawn-m-knepper \"web link\") transferred to her law firm 9s Orange County office in 2012, she asked to be paid at least as much as a male counterpart with similar seniority whom she 9d outscored in\\xa0billable hours and finding more business.\\xa0 Instead, she says the firm\\xa0that specializes in defending companies against just these types of lawsuits paid her about $100,000 less. That 9s one of the claims in Knepper 9s $300 million gender discrimination suit against Ogletree Deakins(https://ogletree.com/ \"Link to Website\"). The firm is dominated by male decision-makers who foster a culture \"that marginalizes, demeans, and undervalues women,\" according to the suit.        Knepper, a nonequity shareholder, contends that while Ogletree 9s website boasts about diversity and equality, about 80 percent of its equity partners are men -- a setup that results in missed opportunities and less pay for women.\\xa0Her proposed class-action complaint against the firm, with more than 700 lawyers in the U.S., was filed Jan. 12 in federal court in San Francisco. In 2016, a woman who sued described a cmale-dominated culture at Sedgwick, a San Francisco-based firm, while Chadbourne & Parke and Proskauer Rose are also facing complaints(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-05/how-america-s -top-law-firms-get-away-with-paying-women-less \"How America\\ 9s Top Law Firms Get Away With Paying Women Less\") for gender discrimination. Ryan King, a spokesman for Ogletree Deakins, said equal opportunity has always been a core principle of the firm, and that discrimination of any kind isn 9t tolerated. More than half of the firm 9s employees are women, including many of its most successful attorneys and two of four elected members of its compensation committee, he said.  Pay Policies \"The decision-making process that governs our compensation system is both fair and equitable,\" King said in a statement. \"We will confidently defend the firm against these claims as we remain steadfast in our commitment to equal opportunity for all.\" King said the firm uses an \"open compensation\" system under which all shareholders know what every other shareholder earns, as well as the factors used in setting that pay. He added that female shareholders in California have made more on average during the past four years than their male counterparts.     David Stanford, an attorney who represents Knepper, said the firm 9s pay data for men and women employees across the U.S. aren 9t that simple. He said he has more women -- both equity and non-equity shareholders-- lined up to join the lawsuit. Each potential plaintiff will bring added facts, he said. \"Ms. Knepper has raised her underpayment in every shareholder compensation interview and has submitted follow-up appeals as well,\" the suit states. \"Her complaints have fallen on deaf ears.\" Knepper, who joined the firm in 2005 in\\xa0San Antonio, Texas, also says a male lawyer denied her requests for more business opportunities, turned down her bid to attend a Southern California conference for the Association of Corporate Counsel, and refused to let her speak at a seminar for in-house counsel that draws hundreds of attendees from around the world, including some of her own clients. Female lawyers face hurdles at all levels in their career. While women make up over half of current law school graduates, they only make up 35 percent of lawyers at law firms, a survey from Law 360 found last year. A 2016 survey by the legal staffing firm Major, Lindsey & Africa of 2,100 law partners found women earned an average of $659,000 a year compared with an average of $949,000 for male partners.\\xa0 The case is Knepper v.

(Zach Gibson/Bloomberg) The latest CBS News poll(https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans- support-daca-but-oppose-border-wall-cbs-news-poll/), consistent with other surveys, finds President Trump suffering from historically low approval ratings (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-at-one-year-low-job-approval-but- economy-is-good-cbs-news-poll/)(37 percent approve/58 percent disapprove) and from even worse ratings on his handling of immigration (34 percent/61 percent). Fifty-three percent rate him as a poor president. A stunning 87 percent want the cdreamers to stay, and opinion is split as to whether it is worth a government shutdown (46/48) to get a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals fix. By contrast, his wall garners only 35 percent approval; 61 percent disapprove. Americans have a preference for immigrants selected on cbackground (47 percent) over those with family connections (39 percent). They reject the notion that we should only take those from cstable, economically successful countries (15 percent); 67 percent say we should not differentiate between those from unstable and those from stable countries. Asked about his slur against African countries, 73 percent said it was unacceptable, including a plurality (41 percent) of Republicans. In short, virtually everything Trump and his anti-immigrant crowd believe (the wall, excluding people from s***hole countries) is out of step with a very high percentage of Americans. The notion that immigrants from poor countries deplete us defies common sense, history and economic reality. Nevertheless, the aversion to people who are predominately brown and black runs high in this administration. It also demonstrates a painful lack of economic literacy, ignorance about our aging workforce and willful blindness about the entrepreneurial contributions of immigrants and their children. Attorney General Jeff Sessions(https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/953441805873369089) 4 who uses the messaging and data from virulently anti-immigrant extremist groups (e.g. FAIR) 4 had this to say: cWhat good does it do to bring in somebody who 9s illiterate in their own country, has no skills, and is going to struggle in our country and not be successful? That is not what a good nation should do, and we need to get away from it. Where to begin? Let 9s start with the fact immigrants have a higher level of education (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/05/todays-newly- arrived-immigrants-are-the-best-educated-ever/)than native-born Americans. Among those Africans Trump belittled 42 percent include college graduates. Tyler Cowen writes:(http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary /ct-perspec-africa-immigration-trump-norway-slur-0116-20180112-story.html) > One of the most striking facts, unbeknownst even to many immigration advocates, is the superior education of Africans coming to this country. Of adults 25 years or older born in Africa and living in the U.S., 41.7 percent have a bachelor 9s degree or more, according to 2009 data. For contrast, only 28.1 percent of the native-born American population has a bachelor 9s degree or more, and 26.8 percent of foreign-born adults as a whole have a college degree, both well below the African rate. > > How about high school diplomas? About one-third of immigrants overall lack this credential but only 11.7 percent of African-born migrants don 9t have a high school degree 4 close to the estimated rate for native-born Americans, 11.4 percent. > > Or consider Nigerian-Americans, Nigeria being Africa 9s most populous nation: Their education levels are among the very highest in the U.S., above those of Asians, with 17 percent having a master 9s degree. > > About three-quarters of African migrants speak English, and they have above- average rates of labor force participation. They are also much less likely to commit violent crimes than native-born Americans. Sessions 9s vision of people from poor countries as unskilled, unable to acquire skills and illiterate is nothing but blatant racism. His assumption that they will not be successful is contrary to the history of America as a haven for immigrants who come to better themselves. He 9s turned the Statute of Liberty ( cGive me \\u2026 your huddled masses . . .) on her head. He plainly has a view of who should be an American, and it does not include the best and brightest brown and black people from around the world. That 9s a strain of un-American bigotry we have not heard from public officials since the 1920s when quotas were imposed for the express purpose of keeping cundesirables out.  ",

        "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis acknowledged Tuesday that he and President Donald Trump 9s incoming national security adviser, John Bolton, have different world views but predicted they will develop a working partnership.  cI look forward to working with him 4 no reservations, no concerns at all, Mattis told reporters at an impromptu news conference. cLast time I checked he 9s an American. I 9m not in the least bit concerned. Mattis said he has never met Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations and conservative firebrand. He said he expects Bolton to pay a visit to the Pentagon soon, perhaps this week, to begin developing a relationship.  cI 9ll tell you right up front: it 9s going to be a partnership, he said. When a reporter mentioned that people see his world view as significantly different than that of Bolton, Mattis replied, cThat 9s the normal thing you want, unless you want group- think. Bolton, who will replace Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on April 9, has publicly advocated for overthrowing the North Korean government, possibly by force. Mattis, a retired Marine general who knows intimately the costs of war, favors diplomacy to rid the North of its nuclear weapons and has said war on the Korean peninsula would be ccatastrophic. On Iran, too, Mattis would seem at odds with Bolton, who has argued for abandoning the Obama-era nuclear deal. These and other matters of war and peace will test Mattis 9 influence with Trump as his national security team is overhauled. Mattis was sometimes at odds with McMaster, but the arrival of the hawkish Bolton, combined with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the uncertain status of John Kelly as White House chief of staff, appears to leave Mattis more isolated than at any time since he took over the Pentagon 15 months ago. The North Korea issue is front-and-center: Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean President Kim Jong Un by May to discuss the North 9s nuclear disarmament. The unprecedented summit could be a turning point in a decades- old U.S.-North Korean standoff that Trump himself has said could end in cfire and fury - an American nuclear attack __ to stop the North from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile.  cThis is buckle-up time, retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said last week on MSNBC. cFor the military I have three words: Sharpen your swords. He (Bolton) is someone who is going to reach for the military instrument. The changes in the White House and at the State Department, while significant for Mattis, are hardly heart-stopping. People close to him sense no change in his commitment to the job; some suggest that Trump 9s decision to move former Republican congressman and current CIA director Mike Pompeo to State, replacing Tillerson, could benefit Mattis in the sense that he 9ll have a partner at State who is better aligned with Trump. Publicly, Mattis has said little about the shakeup. He was in Afghanistan when Tillerson got the ax. When reporters asked his reaction a couple of days later, Mattis said he preferred not to comment on the details, although he went on to suggest that its importance was being exaggerated. He said that in all of his discussions abroad with foreign government officials and American troops, the matter was not brought up once.  cI understand why you 9re asking, but I 9m just pointing out that in most parts of the world this is a Washington, D.C., story, he said. Another Washington story is Mattis and his ability to forge a workable relationship with Trump despite differences on some issues like the Iran nuclear deal, which Mattis says is flawed but worth honoring as long as the Iranians do. Mattis also has differed with the president over Trump 9s wish to bar all transgender people from serving in the military, and he helped sway Trump from his inclination last year to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan. The Mattis formula seems to be simple. Out of the spotlight, out of trouble. The less he says publicly, the less he risks losing influence with Trump.  cPart of his success ... is absolutely the fact that you don 9t see him in the limelight terribly much, says Loren Dejonge Schulman, a defense analyst at the Center for a New American Security who served in key national security positions in the White House and Pentagon under President Barack Obama. cThat may be keeping him out of trouble with the White House but I think it 9s setting an incredibly bad precedent in terms of Pentagon transparency. If Mattis, who spent more than 40 years in uniform and is the first career military officer to lead the Pentagon since George C. Marshall in the early 1950s, isn 9t the most experienced politician to run the military 9s vast bureaucracy, he has shown a knack for staying out of trouble with his thin-skinned boss. Mattis has even broken Trump of his habit of calling the retired general cMad Dog, which Mattis insists was a media invention to begin with. Trump frequently has lunch and dinners with the defense secretary and speaks glowingly of him to outside advisers. White House officials have said that Trump sometimes repeats military historical anecdotes he heard from Mattis. Even Mattis 9 few known stumbles have not dogged him. In August, for example, Mattis told sailors at a submarine base in his home state of Washington that the Navy would give them the worst and the best days of their lives, and then added, cThat means you 9re not some (expletive) sitting on the sidelines, he said. cYou know what I mean, kind of sitting there saying, 8Well, I should have done something with my life. 9 His language was quickly forgotten. The episode pointed to a man who has shaped the job and not let it shape him. So much so that perhaps the most poignant criticism of his tenure has been the secrecy with which the military has handled everything from troop deployment numbers to the details of its military strategies 4 things that often were made public under previous secretaries. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.

Rooks_ That is a striking truth at the heart of an important new book,  cCutting School: Privatization, Segregation, and The End of Public Education. d(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/154146091X?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=154146091X) It was written by Noliwe M. Rooks, director of American studies at Cornell University whose research includes racial inequality in education. Rooks takes a unique look at the history of and the forces driving the privatization and deregulation in public education today 4 which is supported by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. She explains how 19th century Reconstruction-era policies led to the creation of separate, segregated and unequal systems of schooling 4 in which black children from poor families got inferior educations. And, coining the term csegrenomics, she links that era to today, when companies and individuals are profiting handsomely from segregated and inequitable education. Along with this analysis, Rooks looks at people and movements who are fighting segregated education and working to save urban public schools, and she argues that integration is the antidote to crumbling school districts and efforts to privatize public education. Rooks, who served for 10 years as the associate director of African American studies at Princeton University, is an interdisciplinary scholar who explores how race and gender are connected to popular culture, social history and political life. Her earlier books are  cWhite Money/Black Power d(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807032719?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0807032719) and  cHair Raising. d(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813523125?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0813523125) Here is a Q & A I did with Rooks, followed by a podcast she recently did with education blogger Jennifer Berkshire, author of\\xa0the Have You Heard blog and podcast, (http://edushyster.com/tfas-diversity-paradox-2/)which is worth listening to for additional insight into the book. **Fascinating book. Please talk briefly about the central premise and why you decided to write this now.** I had been thinking about segregation, poverty and education for the better part of 10 years before I actually decided there was a book here worth writing. I think it was on my mind, not so much because of my personal experiences with public education, but because on Princeton 9s campus, where I was working at the time, the topic of education and education reform was everywhere. Of course, Wendy Kopp had come up with the idea for what would become Teach For America while a senior at the school and for many of my students, she occupied rock-star status. But it wasn 9t just TFA that excited students. There were also charter school chains, and venture capitalist firms that were focused on narrowing the opportunity and achievement gaps between students who were wealthy and those who were not, and various consulting firms focusing on education policy and creform organizations began to recruit on the campus with success rates that rivaled those of the financial services companies. Really wealthy titans of industry (often billionaires) began proposing solutions and funding educational cinnovations or experiments designed to close the so-called achievement gaps. There was even a film, cWaiting for Superman, that focused all this attention on struggling schools and communities and talked about fixing all this as an extension of the civil rights movement for our age. Initially, I was totally, and pretty much uncritically enthusiastic about all of it. However, as time went on, I couldn 9t help but begin to notice that the students who were most involved in much of the planning and organizing were white and came from middle and upper-middle class schools. They really didn 9t think it was important to include families and caregivers and students in discussions about what they wanted to see in their neighborhoods, communities and schools, and so much of what was touted as positive interventions involved teaching students in these schools how to raise their hands, sit up straight, take tests, and learn to accept stringent discipline. While none of these things in and of themselves are necessarily negative, I couldn 9t help but notice the difference between what was considered opportunity leveling educational strategies in working class and poor communities, and what children in high achieving districts and private schools got. I began to wonder why in order to csave students who were disenfranchised we had to offer them idiosyncratic forms of education that were worlds apart from the ways we educated the wealthy and privileged. Then, I started to notice how interconnected many of the leading figures were in terms of educational backgrounds, philanthropic support and influences, friendships and this burgeoning business in urban and rural education reform. I thought these interconnected relationships were probably a contemporary phenomenon. So I went looking for earlier periods of time when the education of the poor was not quite so idiosyncratic, concentrated in the hands of people outside of those communities and not so tightly tied to business. I kept backing up almost decade by decade looking for a period when there was a sort of unfettered equality in education until I bumped into the beginning of tax-payer-supported education in the South following the Civil War and there was no further back to go. I couldn 9t find it. So then the book stopped being about telling the story of race, segregation and education in the 21st century and became a story about how we got here and about how we have overlooked the fact that providing educational products, forms and services to racially and economically segregated communities is today a multibillion-dollar business and that amount of money makes it difficult to seriously talk about ending educational segregation. If we as a nation really took seriously dismantling underperforming school districts and replacing them with the same types of educational experiences we provide the wealthy, it would negatively impact the bottom lines of many companies. _ Why the movement to privatize public education is such a bad idea (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/07/14/why-the- movement-to-privatize-public-education-is-a-very-bad- idea/?utm_term=.aabf4097c488)_ **The chow we got here is quite a story. You write that cwe have overlooked the fact that providing educational products, forms and services to racially and economically segregated communities is today a multibillion dollar business and that amount of money makes it difficult to seriously talk about ending educational segregation. Do you think it was overlooked or intentional? And how does that work? How does providing products, forms and services to these communities that are racially segregated perpetuate that segregation and make it hard, if not impossible, to talk about ending educational segregation?** Students educated in wealthy schools perform well as measured by standard educational benchmarks. Students educated in poor schools do not. Racial and economic integration is the one systemic solution that we know ensures the tide will lift all educational boats equally. However, instead of committing to educating poor children in the same way as we do the wealthy, or actually with the wealthy, we have offered separate educational content (such as a reoccurring focus on vocational education for the poor) and idiosyncratic forms of educational funding and delivery (such as virtual charter schools and cyber education) as substitutes for what we know consistently works. While not ensuring educational equality, such separate, segregated, and unequal forms of education have provided the opportunity for businesses to make a profit selling schooling. I am calling this specific form of economic profit csegrenomics. Children who live in segregated communities and are Native American, black or Latino are more likely to have severely limited educational options. In the last 30 years, government, philanthropy, business and financial sectors have heavily invested in efforts to privatize certain segments of public education; stock schools with inexperienced, less highly paid teachers whose hiring often provides companies with a cfinder 9s fee d; outsource the running of schools to management organizations; and propose virtual schools as a literal replacement for 4 not just a supplement to 4 the brick and mortar educational experience. The attraction, of course, is the large pot of education dollars that 9s been increasingly available to private corporate financial interests. The public education budget funded by taxpayers is roughly $500 billion to $600 billion per year. Each successful effort that shifts those funds from public to private hands 4 and there has been a growing number of such efforts since the 1980s 4 escalates corporate earnings. **What else did you learn while writing the book?** I kept finding out about young people and parents and community members all over the country who are literally giving their all to ensure that they and their children have a better educational future than they themselves had. So often the inspirational stories we hear about students and parents are only associated with charter schools, and rarely with traditional public schools. For example, I learned about an organization comprised of white parents called cIntegrating Schools (https://integratedschools.org/)who are committed to sending their middle-class white children to economically vulnerable schools that are majority black or Latino. This is an example of cparental choice different from what the term usually means. We just don 9t hear about white, wealthy parents who think that racial and economic integration is important enough a goal that they make a commitment to helping the integration effort by starting with their own children. Also, I learned that across the country, students are striking and protesting and meeting with elected officials and educational administrators in order to work with them to improve their educational experiences. I had to go looking for these stories. I don 9t know if I would have known that they existed otherwise. I found these stories uplifting and learning about them is one of the reasons I ended the book with narratives of two students who I had taught in college, and who had both gone on to have careers in public education. I don 9t have the last word in the book. They do. I think that is how it should be. **So where do we go from here? How do we even start?** In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech entitled cWhere Do We Go From Here: Community or Chaos? I often reflect on his questions when thinking about where the contemporary paths we are traveling in relation to public education are leading. I think community or chaos are two potential destinations. We have to stop and reflect on where both our educational preferences and policies are leading us. We can either continue to encourage chaos by allowing our tax dollars to be used to educationally experiment on working class and poor children, and disrupt poor communities by closing schools, or we can embrace community by requiring that poor children are educated in the same ways as the wealthy. The choices we make are will tell future generations much of what they will need to know about what our democracy means to us here in the 21st century. _ What 8school choice 9 means in the era of Trump and DeVos (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/22/what-school- choice-means-in-the-era-of-trump-and-devos/?utm_term=.2ff950d5e25d)_ -0-0-  You can hear an interview with Rooks here(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__kpfa .org_episode_end-2Dpublic-2Deducation- 2D2_&d=DwMF-g&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=GmoBArA9uoOHdqFAi5tjRg0Qvl5sjR7mDsJuhLp1zaA&m =qwmBkw8XnpYhE2LNjTjN- dMm0EyMtyTCWC9nQFf8m8s&s=uIVG0PteDKOiyqICs5chTMPMd6qFVB9ubWtaT2bP9jE&e=).

The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) says schools too often refuse permission to attend its exams even if pupils will only be away for a couple of hours. Ministers say they support pupils taking arts exams in school hours. But RAD says the position is confusing and wants the guidance made clearer. Since 2013, official guidance on term-time leave(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36277836) has said authorised absences should only be granted in \"exceptional circumstances\".    The RAD says this has caused problems for its own ballet examinations and is also an issue for children taking dance, drama and music exams with some other boards. According to RAD exams director Andrew McBirnie, before 2013 ballet exams could be run \"during the school day and the student was able to leave a class at say 10 o'clock, do their exam and be back by lunchtime - and that seemed to be a perfectly legitimate activity that the student might be doing as part of their all-round education. \"Increasingly over the last few years... there have been more and more schools saying: 'No we can't allow this any more because of this issue with unauthorised absence.'\"  'Mood music' In a recent letter to Ed Vaizey MP, England's education secretary Damian Hinds, said the government expected schools to be sympathetic to requests for leave to take these exams. \"As long as they are satisfied that time away from school will not have a negative effect on a child's education.\" But the letter also says the Department for Education does not explicitly state what constitutes an exceptional circumstance. \"These decisions are best made by head teachers who will know their pupils' individual circumstances best.\" In response, Mr Vaizey said: \"The supportive stance from Damian Hinds is hugely welcome - but greater clarity is still needed. \"I will continue to work with RAD on the issue and will write to the Minister for Education regarding new guidelines for schools\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Mr McBirnie welcomed Mr Vaizey's dialogue with Mr Hinds and hopes it will help persuade more heads to allow pupils to attend performing arts exams in school hours. However, he says the message is still mixed \"between what the guidelines say and the mood music\" from ministers. \"There is no definition or further guidelines about what \"exceptional circumstances\" means at all. So it totally comes down to the interpretation of that phrase which is very vague. \"What's exceptional for one head teacher might not be exceptional for another and to be honest leaving school for a dance exam is not exceptional, it's actually quite routine that children leave to take a dance or drama exam outside school and then come back.\" Ideally, Mr McBirnie says he would like examples of activities where schools would be expected to authorise absence added to the guidance. The National Association of Head Teachers said authorising absences was \"difficult territory for schools because they are so severely held to account for attendance figures\". Deputy General Secretary, Nick Brook, agreed that \"in truth external arts exams are not exceptional circumstances, they are a well understood everyday element of school life. \"A list of approved activities risks creating unnecessary tension. \"What's important is that as long as the school is satisfied that time away will not have a negative effect on a child's education, absence to attend an external exam should be reason enough.\"   ",

          "article": " My students were understanding and compliant. We had done several lessons on the value of showing perseverance in the face of adversity. When I think back on that moment now, I think: No, this is wrong. You should be angry. You should demand better. You 4 we 4 should not accept this. But I also remember the short-term pragmatism: They were 7, I was the teacher and we had to get through the school day. !Little kids and &39;toxic stress&39;: we can solve this(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Little kids and &39;toxic stress&39;: we can solve this(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171003184503-child-stress-stock- large-169.jpg)(/2017/10/04/opinions/kids-toxic-stress-the-primary-school- chan-liu/index.html) Little kids and 'toxic stress': we can solve this(/2017/10/04/opinions/kids- toxic-stress-the-primary-school-chan-liu/index.html) Operating within such a strained system, there is pressure to be a good soldier. To carry on and make a way. To some extent, you have to adopt this mentality to do the job; otherwise you'll become paralyzed with anger and hopelessness. And yet as a young, inexperienced teacher, many days I felt like an accomplice to a large-scale crime, all too aware of the inequity playing out around me but also the limitations of what I could do to combat it. There are many, structural layers shaping unequal educational opportunity in this country -- disparate access to technology, high-quality curriculum and teachers, small class sizes, advanced coursework, summer enrichment opportunities, and more. But the recent reports(http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/us/baltimore-schools-cold/index.html) from Baltimore highlight something more visceral and basic: the neglect of rock-bottom, foundational needs of human beings. And this problem isn't unique to winter. The opposite issue(http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/us/baltimore-schools-cold/index.html) emerges in the summer when students face scorching temperatures with unreliable or nonexistent air conditioning. A city of students go without(http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci- lead-in-water-20160409-story.html) running drinking water because of concerns of lead poisoning.

Our children know how much we value them by the schools we build for them.\" The recent reports out of Baltimore strike a chord precisely because the message they send to students and families of color is so plainly, unarguably egregious. How do we right these wrongs? Maryland state officials charge(https://twitter.com/BoydKRutherford/status/948581150351650817) local fiscal mismanagement of dollars as city leaders point to the compounded effects(https://education.umd.edu/file/2746/download?token=ai0wPoqq) of underfunding city schools for decades(http://schoolfunding.info/wp- content/uploads/2017/03/judicialbaltimore.pdf). There are valid questions around where promised school funding from a newly built casino in downtown Baltimore is going. We need clearer answers and accountability, but amid all this back and forth, children are freezing. To be sure, there have been small glimmers of hope and progress, the fruit of civil rights advocates' efforts over the years. A major win(http://news.wypr.org/post/21st-century-building-plan-aims-update-and- combine-baltimore-city-schoolsstream/0) came in 2013 when the Maryland General Assembly approved legislation to authorize $1 billion to renovate nearly two dozen city schools by 2021. The first two state-of-the-art schools of this initiative opened(http://www.wbaltv.com/article/officials-cut- ribbon-for-new-21st-century-schools-in-baltimore/12053294) earlier this fall, and officials say they are moving ahead on time and within budget (https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2017/03/01/baltimore-schools-1 -1b-construction-plan-moves.html)with the rest. !Want to make college more affordable?

Now, Maryland education advocates are again mobilizing(http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/bs-md-kirwan- hearing-20171012-story.html) for another battle in Annapolis as state lawmakers seek to comprehensively overhaul the school funding system for the first time in 15 years. It is a critical moment for equity with potential for long-lasting impact. Even still, injecting financial resources and renovating buildings does not address the more fundamental, entrenched problem we all live with(https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem- we-all-live-with-part-one). Brown v. Board of Education teaches \"separate but equal\" is faulty doctrine; schools will never be truly equal if they are not integrated. And as Dr. Alvin Thornton, a Howard University professor, said in a recent interview(https://vimeo.com/247355496/2d9d5ec360), \"Schools should not be asked to bear the load of desegregating our society. ... If we want to have diverse schools, you must have diverse communities.\" This work requires grappling with the legacies of white flight, redlining and discriminatory housing practices that have enabled the de facto segregation we see. Indeed, as several scholars have noted(https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/why-housing- policy-really-education-policy), housing policy is education policy.

        "article": " An assisted-living facility in Liverpool, England, was confronted with an unusual dilemma in 2013: An elderly resident with severe dementia suddenly became terrified of water and showering 4 and categorically refused to bathe. ,  cHis demeanor and his well-being started disintegrating. It became socially unacceptable, recalled Carol Rogers, executive director for education and visitors at National Museums Liverpool(http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/), a complex of eight cultural venues that developed and now operates a dementia program. cThe other older people didn 9t want him in the day room. It wasn 9t pleasant for them, and there was a loss of dignity for him. , When the museums were contacted for advice, they offered one of their memory- stimulating suitcases: one that was linked to bathing. Inside was a bar of strong-smelling carbolic soap, a kind widely used during the war years. ,  cIt evoked a very strong memory for him, of sitting in front of the fire at bath time, Ms. Rogers said. cThey got him to bathe with it and managed to get him integrated back into the community. , That suitcase is one of about 40 that have been devised as part of House of Memories(http://houseofmemories.co.uk/), the Liverpool Museums 9 multipronged dementia program, which just celebrated its fifth birthday. The program also has its own app(https://houseofmemories.co.uk/things-to-do/my- house-of-memories-app/), offers training days for caregivers and family members, and memory walks, hourlong guided tours of the Museum(http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/index.aspx) of Liverpool(http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/index.aspx) devised to get older visitors to share their memories of life in the city. , The suitcases cover 1930 to 1980. Themes include transportation, the natural world and ethnicity; for example, Irish and Afro-Caribbean people are among the groups represented. One suitcase contains items like fliers from early Gay Pride marches and club nights; photos of venues in the 1950s, 960s and 970s; and a pair of brown suede Hush Puppies, which some gay men wore to spot each other at a time when homosexuality still had not been decriminalized in Britain. , Backed by the British government and by state-funded British health care partners, House of Memories has now trained more than 12,000 people nationwide, and is crossing the Atlantic: The Minnesota Historical Society(http://www.mnhs.org/) plans to offer its version of the app in the fall. , The idea first came to Ms. Rogers as a way of csupporting our aging society, she said. cGlobally, we 9re all living longer, and we all want to live well, but there are older people in our community who are socially isolated, she said. cThey 9re lonely. Among them, people with dementia are particularly isolated, she said, and museums with recent collections could help. Photographs, memorabilia and objects 4 be they the actual items or images of them on apps 4 help rekindle memories in people with dementia and lead them to start conversations. , Ms. Rogers also had a personal motivation. Her mother chad a stroke many years ago, at age 70, cand she had memory loss problems and couldn 9t communicate, she recalled. cFor 10 years, we struggled as a family to connect with her. , She teamed up with colleagues to start a dementia program, seeking input from local caregivers, doctors and nurses, then tried it out with her mother, Margaret. cI knew by her eye contact, by her squeezing of my hand, that she gained great pleasure from having that experience, Ms. Rogers said. cIt was interactive, it was personal. It got right to the hub of Margaret 9s life story. , The next step was to offer the objects, narratives and experiences to dementia sufferers digitally, via an app. It was tested with people who had dementia, as well as caregivers and families. Eileen Gilbert, whose 83-year-old husband, Dave, was found to have Alzheimer 9s four years ago, was part of the app focus group. , When Dave 9s dementia was diagnosed, cit was a shock to us all, she said, referring to her three children, all in their 50s. Even before the diagnosis, she sensed that something was wrong. cThere were silly things that he would forget, Ms. Gilbert said. cHe would say, 8Is one of the children coming home from school? 9 , The tablet-based app offers an array of themes, and Mr. Gilbert chose images of 20th-century Liverpool: the cinemas, the Blacklers department store with the rocking horse(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-U-ZWrgjw4 \"Video\") at the top of the stairs, the Punch and Judy puppet show. ,  cNow, I can put the tablet on for Dave, and he can sit there and press the different things, she said. cIt 9s fascinating watching him: He recognizes things on it. ,  cIt 9s kept Dave active, and that helps me, she added. cHe feels as though he 9s still doing something. , In Minnesota, Maren Levad, a museum access specialist at the historical society, said that when her organization decided to extend its new dementia program statewide, it looked for programs and found Liverpool 9s instantly appealing. , Caregivers in Minnesota, she said, needed tools for cmeaningful, person- centered engagement, and cthis is something House of Memories does brilliantly. The program 9s other attraction was cits clear connection to museum resources: using the collections to service the public. , Seeking a partnership, the historical society 4 whose dementia program is based in St. Paul 4 contacted House of Memories the very week of the app 9s launch. Thanks to funding from the Institute of Museums and Library Services(https://www.imls.gov/) in the United States, the Minnesota society is now the program 9s national headquarters. , The app is being tailored to the United States in a number ways. One is an increased focus on African-Americans, who are twice as likely to receive diagnoses of Alzheimer 9s, chave a very different experience navigating our health system, and different cultural expectations when it comes to caring for elders, Ms. Levad said. , In Liverpool, next on the agenda is exploring options around augmented reality, Ms. Rogers said: using digital technology to recreate 3D object experiences on the screen. cThere 9s a great opportunity there to take objects and experiences into people 9s homes in a different way, she said, noting that they were heading into uncharted territory. cThis is our ambition.

        "article": " A leading AIDS researcher and proponent of medication-assisted therapy for addiction was appointed Wednesday to oversee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(https://www.cdc.gov/ \"cdc\") , Alex M. Azar II, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, announced that the agency 9s new director would be Dr. Robert R. Redfield, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and co-founder of the Institute for Human Virology(http://www.ihv.org/ \"institute for human virology baltimore\"). ,  cDr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients, Mr. Azar said. cWe are proud to welcome him as director of the world 9s premier epidemiological agency. , Dr. Redfield, 66, will replace Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, who resigned in January(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/health/cdc-brenda-fitzgerald- resigns.html) after just six months on the job. Dr. Fitzgerald left amid criticism of her investments with her husband in tobacco and health care companies that posed potential conflicts of interest. , Dr. Redfield oversees clinical care and research at the virology institute, which provides H.I.V. treatment to more than 6,000 patients in the Baltimore- Washington area and more than 1 million people in Africa and the Caribbean. The institute, with an annual budget of more than $105 million, also studies other chronic viral illnesses and cancer. , In his statement, Dr. Azar called Dr. Redfield 9s decades of science and clinical work 4 especially in the field of H.I.V./AIDS 4 cpeerless. He added that the treatment network Dr. Redfield operates in Baltimore for patients with H.I.V. and hepatitis C would help him chit the ground running on a top priority, ccombating the opioid epidemic. , News of Dr. Redfield 9s appointment has revived criticisms about some of his policy stances and research practices that date back to an earlier period in the AIDS epidemic. He came under fire for advocating broad AIDS testing and the screening of military personnel for the virus. , In addition, his research into a potential treatment vaccine led to allegations of data distortion and a military investigation; no evidence of misconduct was found. His record has prompted Senator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, to oppose his appointment, although some advocates for AIDS patients now say they support him for the job. , A graduate of Georgetown University and its School of Medicine, Dr. Redfield did his residency at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, then stayed on as a researcher in the military, focusing on AIDS. In 1996, he launched the virology institute with Dr. Robert C. Gallo, who developed the blood test for H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus.  , Dr. Redfield, 66, has longstanding ties to various government agencies. He served on two advisory panels for the National Institutes of Health from 2002 to 2006, when Mr. Azar was general counsel and then deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human services. Dr. Redfield 9s high profile on AIDS research and policy matters has made him a perennial candidate for the C.D.C. job. He has been a small donor to Republican Party committees, giving about $2,000 in total. , In 2016, the institute was awarded more than $138 million in five-year grants from the C.D.C. to combat H.I.V./AIDS and other health problems in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. It also has a substantial portfolio of corporate-sponsored research, whose underwriters have included Aventis, Gilead, Human Genome Sciences, Merck and Schering. , Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor of Maryland, praised Dr. Redfield. cHe has a wonderful bedside manner and is loving and devoted to his patients, said Ms. Townsend, who served on the institute 9s board. , Terry Lierman, chairman of the institute 9s Board of Advisors, said Dr. Redfield 9s work treating H.I.V. patients who were also addicts made him a great choice for the job. ,  cIn particular, Dr. Redfield has much experience in treating addiction as a co-morbidity to H.I.V. and incorporating addiction treatment into a patient 9s overall primary care, Mr. Lierman said. cThis appointment is refreshingly not about politics, but about quality, competence and compassion. 9 9 , Medical careers run in Dr. Redfield 9s family. Both his parents worked at the National Institutes of Health, and two of his children are doctors. His wife, Joy, is a nurse whom he met while they were delivering babies together. , As the nation 9s public health agency, the C.D.C. is charged with controlling disease outbreaks, ensuring the safety of food and water, and helping reduce the leading causes of death, among them heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. The agency has a budget of more than $7.2 billion, and a staff of more than 12,000 employees working in the United States and around the world. , The C.D.C. was recently in the spotlight when Mr. Azar said he believed the agency should resume research on gun violence, which it drastically cut more than 20 years ago. Dr. Redfield 9s views on gun violence research and other contentious issues such as access to abortion and sexual health education are not yet known. , His work in AIDS research and policy has generated concern over the years, in particular for his call in the mid-1980s to late 1980s for widespread AIDS testing and screening of military recruits for H.I.V. , While pushing for broader AIDS testing during routine exams as a means to contain the epidemic, Dr. Redfield also called for reducing the stigma associated with the disease. At a congressional hearing in August 1987, Dr. Redfield recommended regular testing, at doctor 9s appointments and hospitalizations, as well as for marriage license applicants, and incorporating the test into the practice of medicine, according to news reports. But he also said, cWe have to tell people it 9s anti- American to discriminate against people who have the AIDS virus. , In the early 1990s, Dr. Redfield was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine at presentations and in a report. The investigation led to a correction in some published data, according to documents. , Several high-level colleagues, however, felt the military should have been tougher on Dr. Redfield, who they felt raised false hopes about the efficacy of a treatment vaccine he was developing. At the time, Public Citizen 9s Health Research Group sued to gain the records, and made them public. , In a 1992 letter to Col. Donald Burke, the director of the division of retrovirology, Major Craig W. Hendrix, director of the Air Force HIV program, wrote that the credibility of the military 9s efforts on retroviral research was at risk and under scrutiny. cSevere, painful steps must be taken less we dishonor the honest labors of so many colleagues and patients within our research consortium. We cannot continue to deceive. , In an interview Tuesday, Dr. Hendrix, now a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, recalled the incident, which he now uses as a case study in ethics. ,  cThe facts didn 9t line up, Dr. Hendrix said. cI can 9t know if it was intentional, but I think every scientist has to be the most skeptical of their own data, and the most careful, because nobody else will have all the raw data. , In the letter Senator Murray wrote to President Trump, she mentioned the Army investigation, which criticized Dr. Redfield for a faulty analysis of vaccine trial data, and premature presentation of the information. ,  cThis pattern of ethically and morally questionable behavior leads me to seriously question whether Dr. Redfield is qualified to be the federal government 9s chief advocate and spokesperson for public health, Senator Murray wrote. , But Gregg Gonsalves, an AIDS activist and assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said he was optimistic about Dr. Redfield 9s appointment, noting that many people 9s views on AIDS and other public health issues have evolved over the years, along with the science. ,  cWe don 9t have to be defined by our pasts, but Dr. Redfield has to clarify where he stands now on key issues and place himself firmly in the mainstream of evidence-based public health, Mr. Gonsalves said. , Jesse Milan Jr., president and chief executive of AIDS United, said that Dr. Redfield called on Tuesday to convey that he would embrace the group 9s goals. Those include supporting needle exchanges for drug users, to prevent the spread of H.I.V. through dirty needles, and pre-exposure prophylaxis, the use of an anti-H.I.V. medication to prevent getting the virus. ,  cI heard him commit to our entire H.I.V. prevention toolbox and to supporting health equity for the entire spectrum of marginalized and stigmatized people, Mr. Milan said. cIf he 9s appointed, I can assure you we will hold him to it. , Dr. Redfield did not respond to requests for comment.

Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Will chatbots become indistinguishable from human helpers?  \"Advances in speech recognition, biometric identification, and neurolinguistics will also mean that as we interact with businesses and brands via voice, our experiences will become increasingly conversational and human- like,\" says Servion's Shashi Nirale. J. Walker Smith, executive chairman of Kantar Futures, agrees, saying that \"learning emotional empathy is the final barrier to AI's full-scale market growth\". Talking to machines will become as natural as typing used to be, the tech utopians believe. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google's Home voice- activated assistants are already in many homes, rapidly learning new skills.  * Amazon's Alexa heads to the workplace(/news/technology-42190140) In the workplace, these digital assistants - think of IBM's Watson - will give employees \"more immediate access to data\" that will lead to \"a reduction in repetitive or administrative tasks in their roles\", say Javier Diez-Aguirre, vice president of corporate marketing at office equipment maker Ricoh Europe. This means that AI-powered machines \"will become colleagues, not competitors\", concludes Mark Curtis, co-founder of Fjord, the Accenture-owned design and innovation company.

AI-powered human resources systems could even help workforces become \"superhuman\", argues Pete Schlampp, vice president of analytics at software platform Workday. All those forecast to lose their jobs as a result of AI-powered automation may disagree.  * Robots to 'take 800 million jobs by 2030'(/news/world-us-canada-42170100) And global collaboration will become easier, the world smaller, as translation services become more accurate, argues Alec Dafferner, director of GP Bullhound, a San Francisco-based tech investment and advisory firm. \"Driven by machine learning - seamless and instantaneous translation will become the new normal,\" he says. There seem to be few areas AI will not permeate, from recruitment to facial recognition, cyber-security to energy management systems.  * 'Superhuman' Google AI claims chess crown(/news/technology-42251535) The explosion in the amount of data generated by mobile devices, computers and the \"internet of things\" is feeding these learning algorithms. While the ability to analyse it all in real time using virtually unlimited cloud computing power has accelerated the pace of development. AI still operates according to the rules we set - until we allow it to develop its own rules, of course. But what if those rules and assumptions are inherently biased?  !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05rv4fh.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionCan AI keep Marwell Zoo's animals warm? It's something Rob McCargow, AI programme leader at global consultancy firm PwC, warns about, particularly in the field of recruitment and human resources. \"AI-augmented recruitment stands out as a key growth area with a range of offerings in the market,\" he says. \"But if not governed and implemented responsibly, it can lead to an amplification of bias and discrimination.\" In other words, if past data shows the algorithm that white middle-class males have previously performed well at a company, it might conclude that this is the type of candidate it should select in future, reinforcing gender and racial stereotypes. An example of AI not acting intelligently at all. The old computing maxim \"rubbish in, rubbish out\", still applies.  Cyber-security: 'Weaponised AI' While many cyber-security firms point out AI's potential in combating cyber- attacks - monitoring computer networks in real time for signs of abnormal behaviour, for example - others soberly observe that AI will also be \"weaponised\" by the hackers. \"2018 could be the year we see the first battle of the AI bots,\" warns Dr Adrian Nish, head of threat intelligence at BAE Systems.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption AI programs could end up doing battle in cyberspace  \"It's inevitable that attackers will begin to incorporate machine learning and AI at the same rate as network defence tools. We may already be at this point, with online Twitter bots able to react to emerging events and crafting messages to respond.\" Simple but effective email phishing attacks, whereby employees are hoodwinked into clicking on dodgy links or downloading malware because they think the message is from someone genuine, could reach another level of sophistication, says Dave Palmer, director of technology at security firm, Darktrace.  * Three words to set alarm bells off for every firm(/news/business-39429819) Imagine a piece of malware that can train itself on how your writing style differs depending on who you are contacting and uses this to send relevant messages to your contacts, he says. \"These phishing messages will be so realistic that the target will fall for them. Such advances in AI will take us to the next stage in defenders versus attackers, and we need to be ready.\"  More Technology of Business  Image copyrightGetty Images   * 'We should own our own livelihood and our own dream'(/news/business-42188808)   * How did music producer Gramatik raise $2m in 24 hours?(/news/42337546)   * Lock out: The Austrian hotel that was hacked four times(/news/business-42352326)   * Buy food for the family or pay to see a doctor?(/news/business-42309911)  Cyber-security experts also warn about a growing threat to the integrity of data - hackers sabotaging data rather than stealing it. You can do a lot of damage to a company's reputation, profits and share price if you mess with the facts on which it bases important investment decisions. The burgeoning number of internet-connected IoT devices is another soft target for hackers.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption AI important for facial and image recognition  \"If security isn't internally integrated, then these IoT\\u202fdevices will be low-hanging fruit for attackers, who will always target the path of least resistance,\" says Asaf Ashkenazi of semiconductor and security firm Rambus. Meanwhile, businesses are steeling themselves for more ransomware attack, building up stockpiles of bitcoins with which to pay extortionists, says Chris Mayers of Citrix. AI will only accelerate the cyber-security arms race.  Blockchain, mixed reality and other trends While Bitcoin's price leaps up and down like a crazy bucking bronco - the underlying technology blockchain will make steady progress, many believe. The distributed ledger tech \"has the potential to add an important aspect of traceability to the foods we eat\", says Tony Rodriguez, chief technology officer at Digimarc Corporation. \"Walmart, Kroger, McCormick, Tyson Foods and others have teamed up with IBM to experiment with track-and-trace tests on Chinese pork and Mexican mangoes, and we expect blockchain to be used more prevalently in grocery, retail and other industries.\"  !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p04sj9qn.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionKarishma Vaswani takes a look at blockchain and explains how it works International banks have already experimented with blockchain-based trading systems that cut out the need for any middleman. Meanwhile, lighter, more powerful virtual reality (VR) headsets will move the tech beyond gaming into more everyday uses, from looking round properties to virtual shopping, accurately recreating real stores. And augmented reality services on smartphones will begin to transform the static world around us into something more dynamic and interactive - a golden opportunity for brands to market their wares more entertainingly. \"This will bring new meaning to the phrase 'try before you buy',\" says Chris Wood, director of retail at Salesforce, the customer relationship management platform. Drones will extend their surveying and photographing work, helping farmers, utility companies, estate agents, insurance companies and emergency services. And driverless cars and trucks will continue to be tested.  * How 'super vision' will change the way we see the world(/news/business-42097613) Philip Trillmich, a partner at international law firm White & Case, even thinks this will be the year \"we see substantial innovation in driverless cargo ships\". We will continue becoming a cashless society, with social media platforms offering more financial services and smartphones being used more for in-store payments. But AI will be the dominant theme - for good or ill.  * Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter(https://twitter.com/matthew_wall) and Facebook(https://www.facebook.com/MatthewWallBBC/)  * Click here for more Technology of Business features(http://bbc.in/1LTVk7w)   ",
