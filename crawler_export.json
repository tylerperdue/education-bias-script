            "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had (https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27/asm-unanimously-approves- contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions-from- campus/)gathered(https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27/asm-unanimously- approves-contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions-from-campus/) last spring to consider a resolution(https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/04/27 /asm-unanimously-approves-contentious-divestment-proposal-to-mixed-reactions- from-campus/) calling on the university to divest in companies and countries that abuse human rights, profit from the cmilitary-industrial complex and promote fossil fuels when the debate jumped the rails. , Soon, the students were in a full-scale battle over whether the resolution should cover Israel, with charges of anti-Semitism and racism rattling the room. A student representative who was Jewish said that the last-minute inclusion of Israel ccrossed the line from legitimate conversation to a point where I consider it malicious. The student government chairwoman, who is black, suggested the opposition to the resolution amounted to cwhite supremacy, which she condemned with a four-letter expletive. , In the aftermath, Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, decided to enter the fray, writing(http://brandeiscenter.com/ldb-urges-further-action-from-uw-madison/) to university administrators to denounce calls for divestment from Israel as anti-Semitic, and to assail the meeting as hostile toward Jewish students. He urged that the black student leader be disciplined. , On Thursday, Mr. Marcus received the approval of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to be President Trump 9s assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department, a prestigious post known more for policing racial bias and sexual violence in schools than refereeing the battles over Israel and Palestinian rights on the nation 9s university campuses. , Mr. Marcus 9s support for Jewish students has earned him praise in some quarters as an ardent defender of civil liberties with an acumen for the rule of law. On campus after campus, the B.D.S. movement 4 Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel 4 has driven a wedge between Jewish students and students of color, challenging university administrations and straining the traditional bonds between Jews and other minorities. And Mr. Marcus has not been shy in choosing sides. , Critics see him as a biased crusader whose singular focus on what he believes to be rising anti-Semitism on the campus left will further impede the Education Department 9s already tentative efforts to enforce civil rights protections for marginalized groups of students. ,  cWhat I find particularly troubling is he condemned a black woman on a predominantly white campus for pointing out my oppression, said Carmen Gosey, who was chairwoman of the Associated Students of Madison, the Wisconsin student government, at the time of the battle there last year. , His approach to the debate at the university cshows he doesn 9t understand racism, or he has an issue with black people talking about issues, or anyone who isn 9t Jewish talking about their issues, which seems very problematic for someone who is going to be in charge of civil rights, she said. , Ariela Rivkin, the Jewish student representative on the council, disagreed. She and other students felt targeted by Ms. Gosey 9s comments and believed she allowed the divestment legislation to be organized on the Jewish holiday of Passover, which they considered harassing and exclusionary. , Mr. Marcus 9s intervention cmeant everything to me, said Ms. Rivkin, who strongly backed Mr. Marcus 9s nomination to head the Education Department 9s civil rights office. cWhoever is in that role should be able to recognize that I have a right to express myself in a hostile-free environment. , For his part, Mr. Marcus, a career civil liberties lawyer, says he would show no bias in his approach to civil rights enforcement. During his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Marcus said he could cthink of no higher calling than to enforce the principles of equal justice and provide greater opportunities for students across this great country. , Mr. Marcus was delegated the authority of assistant secretary for civil rights for two years in the Bush administration where he reinforced protections for women and Jews as well as Muslims and Sikhs who faced religious discrimination in the wake of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. , If confirmed by the full Senate, Mr. Marcus would return to the high-profile office at a turbulent time. Issues of race, religion, sexual identity and freedom of speech are roiling elementary, secondary and higher education. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is under fire for Mr. Trump 9s attitudes toward and treatment of immigrants and minority groups, and her own re- examination of Obama-era rules(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos- colleges-sex-assault.html) to protect against sexual assault and race discrimination in special education placements is controversial. ,  cTo me, he is more dangerous than she is, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, one of the many human rights groups opposing Mr. Marcus 9s nomination. cHe is infinitely more effective. , Mr. Marcus served in both the housing and education departments under Mr. Bush and as staff director for the bipartisan United States Commission on Civil Rights, positions that his supporters say have afforded him the skills to combat the most intractable civil rights challenges. ,  cHe has a real good understanding about how all of our rights as Americans fit together, so he 9s not one-dimensional in any way, said Jennifer C. Braceras, a former member of the commission. , His critics question whether he will fulfill the office 9s goal to stand up for all students. More than 30 civil rights organizations wrote a letter (https://civilrights.org/oppose-confirmation-kenneth-marcus-assistant- secretary-civil-rights/)to the Senate Education Committee urging his rejection. , The groups cited Mr. Marcus 9s record of rejecting policies that address discrimination against minority groups, including affirmative action and the evidence that minority students are more likely to face tough disciplinary actions. The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund said Mr. Marcus was cunlikely to advance diversity and equal access to educational resources. , During his confirmation hearing last month(https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marcus1.pdf), Mr. Marcus said that he believed that if disproportionately high numbers of black students were being disciplined it would be grounds for concern, though it would not indicate outright discrimination or set off a systemic investigation. Ms. DeVos 9s administration has been criticized for taking a similar approach to all civil rights enforcement. ,  cMy experience says one needs to approach each complaint or compliance review with an open mind and sense of fairness to find out what the answers are, Mr. Marcus told the committee. cI have seen what appear to be inexcusable disparities that were result of paperwork errors. , The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights also questioned his support for Ms. DeVos 9s decision to rescind Obama-era guidance that strengthened processes for investigating sexual assault on college campuses. Ms. DeVos has expressed concern that the guidance has unfairly affected those accused of misconduct. , But Mr. Marcus has garnered support from conservative civil liberties groups that believe that he will rein in what they see as an overreach of civil rights enforcement during the Obama administration. , Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, said that under the Obama administration, affirmative action morphed into cracial preference. To extend legal protection to cover gender identity and sexual orientation, he said, is csimply not good law. ,  cThe civil rights laws say and mean something different than what was interpreted by the Obama administration, and I think that will change, Mr. Clegg said. cI think Ken is more in line with our interpretation of things. , Human rights groups also expressed concern that Mr. Marcus will use his office to further a more narrow agenda: combating the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement on college campuses, which he believes has devolved into violent, anti-Semitic harassment. , From his perch at the Brandeis Center, he has filed anti-Semitic harassment complaints with the Office for Civil Rights against three University of California college campuses, and encouraged Jewish students and their supporters to do the same. , Mr. Marcus wrote(http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Standing- up-for-Jewish-students-325648) in an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post that while the complaints were rejected, they had created public relations headaches for the institutions. ,  cIf a university shows a failure to treat initial complaints seriously, it hurts them with donors, faculty, political leaders and prospective students, Mr. Marcus wrote. , In its opposition, the Leadership Conference said that Mr. Marcus csought to use the Office of Civil Rights complaint process to chill a particular point of view, rather than address unlawful discrimination. , Mr. Marcus has lobbied for institutions and the Education Department to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism that Jewish activists embrace but that many Palestinian rights groups say would render criticism of Israel as hate speech. Mr. Marcus has also said that Middle East programs accused of an anti-Israel agenda should lose federal funding. ,  cHis primary mission is not to support students 9 civil rights; it 9s to protect Israel from criticism, said Rahul Saksena, an attorney with Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights group. , A group of 60 religious and educational organizations disagreed. They point to instances where Mr. Marcus has litigated First Amendment cases. ,  cWhile some believe that preventing discrimination in education and protecting the First Amendment are at odds, we could not disagree more. Both principles are paramount, wrote the group, which included Christian groups, Students and Parents Against Campus Anti-Semitism, and Stop BDS on Campus. , Mr. Marcus 9s support from conservative Christians extends beyond their broad backing of Israel. In 1998, Mr. Marcus spoke at a Traditional Values Coalition conference, where he criticized hate crimes legislation that would cover violence based on sexual orientation. He described the legislation as cgiving preferred treatment of some sorts of victims over other sorts of victims, and punishing people for cunpopular and ctraditionalist views. ,  cThere are people who are using the word 8hate 9 to denigrate some traditional moral values, Mr. Marcus told the group.(https://www.c-span.org/video/?103282-1/homosexuality-public-policy) , In response to more than 50 questions from Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Marcus said that his views expressed at the Traditional Values conference had cevolved.

            "article": " For the first time this Tuesday, the 70-member junior class of Chisholm High School in Enid, Okla., will sit for the SAT college entrance exam, but almost all the students will be clicking through Chromebooks instead of blackening bubbles with a No. 2 pencil. , One hundred fifteen miles east of Enid, the Tulsa, Okla., schools were also invited this year to administer an online version of the SAT, the exam that Tulsa 9s 1,700 juniors must take. The district chose paper and pencil. , Like Chisholm, Tulsa already gives all its end-of-year tests online. But this is the first year that SAT scores must be reported to the state for Oklahoma 9s school accountability report cards, and principals just did not want to risk an internet problem or power outage, explained Erin Lester, director of assessment. There are other challenges for this urban district, too, like how to give an online test to those likely to be in jail, juvenile detention or a mental health facility, a number that could range from dozens to more than 100 on testing day. ,  cSome of the jails don 9t even allow computers with internet accessibility, Ms. Lester said. cWe wanted to be equitable. , Long in the works, the digital transition by the two college testing companies is taking a few more cautious steps forward this year. But with 29 states, the District of Columbia and many of the largest cities giving the standardized exams to all juniors, the complexity of the task has never been greater. ,  **READ MORE** : Here 9s What You Need to Know About Online Testing for the ACT and SAT(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/tests- act-sat.html) , Out in front is ACT Inc.(https://www.act.org/), which began digital testing in 2015 and will move all its international testing online this fall 4 a year later than planned. ACT offers the digital option to all 16 states and 1,100 districts that contract with it, said Edward Colby, a spokesman. But just 8 percent of roughly one million school-day tests given last year were digital. ,  cThe challenges I often hear are about the entire state having enough laptops for every single junior and senior to take an assessment on the same day, said Angie McAllister, ACT senior vice president for research. cACT is responding to what our customers are asking us for, and today, they are still saying we want to do most of it on paper. , ACT 9s archrival, the College Board, are offering digital versions of the school-day SAT in Oklahoma and Ohio this month. Altogether, about 100 schools will take either the SAT or Preliminary SAT exams online, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman. But it, too, has had stumbles and resistance. ,  cWe will continue to work with educators to navigate the unique challenges of responsibly delivering digital assessments while safeguarding access and equity, Jeremy Singer, the chief operating officer, said in a statement. , Digital testing offers the potential for lower cost, instant results and more accurate scoring. Eliminating test booklets and answer sheets provides greater security from test theft, a serious concern after major cheating scandals in the United States and abroad. An increasing share of professional, licensing and postgraduate exams are digital-only, including the GRE, MCAT and GMAT. , Digital literacy in schools was a core goal of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which mandated annual testing of schoolchildren grades three through eight and in high school to hold schools accountable. The Common Core academic standards, released in 2010 and accepted by most states, called for state accountability tests to be administered online. , But developing an online version of a high-stakes standardized test requires exhaustive studies of such factors as laptop scrolling speeds, screen loading of various equipment and fine-grained statistical comparisons of scores, Ms. McAllister said. , Test administration poses its own challenges. In South Carolina last year, the first statewide mandatory online ACT exam was marred by technical difficulties, forcing some schools to administer makeup tests and delaying some score reports. Mr. Colby blamed a nationwide outage beyond ACT 9s control, but Ryan Brown, an Education Department spokesman, said the state encouraged districts to seek waivers for paper tests this year, and many did. ,  cFrankly, we don 9t trust ACT 9s capacity to test an entire state online, he said. , ACT adapted by requiring a new test setup this year. The approach, known as proctor caching, is in place in suburban Edmond, Okla., where 1,692 juniors are taking the ACT online for the first time at three high schools and an alternative academy. Each school has a dedicated server that downloads and administers the test to individual students 9 work stations, thus avoiding web-related problems. ,  cWe have not had one phone call from a parent concerned or questioning, said Angela Mills Grunewald, associate superintendent. cI think online testing is so much the norm that it 9s not a concern. , But Oklahoma City opted for the paper SAT this year, because the city does not yet have enough equipment and its older buildings are prone to power and network failures. The 2013 debut of Oklahoma 9s online statewide testing is remembered as a debacle. ,  cMany students already experience anxiety while taking exams such as the SAT, and disruptions in testing may further increase this anxiety for students, said Beth Harrison, chief communications officer for the Oklahoma City schools. , It 9s not just students who are anxious, said Thomas Tucker, superintendent of the Princeton City School District in Cincinnati, which plans to give the SAT online on Tuesday. ,  cWhen you change from one mode of test administration to another, scores typically drop 4 we know that for a fact, said Mr. Tucker, who serves on a College Board advisory panel. Adept as this generation is online, teenagers are most at ease using phones, not keyboards, he said. Though scores tend to rebound later, Mr. Tucker said many of his colleagues do not want even a temporary score drop on their watch. cThey don 9t want to bite the bullet, he said. , Closer study has shown that scores drop only among students who do not use computers for everyday schoolwork, said Tracy Weeks, executive director of the State Educational Technology Directors Association. , The College Board and ACT emphasize the practice value of their online exams in earlier grades, as well as their free online test prep: The College Board promotes the score-boosting power of its partner Khan Academy, commonly used in school and after-school curriculums, while ACT this spring began its own ACT Academy online test prep. , Nevertheless, many students still feel more confident with pencil and paper. Bryce Kessler, a senior at Princeton High School, who hopes to study musical theater, said he took the online SAT at school last year but did better on the pencil-and paper Saturday ACT for which he had been practicing for years. ,  cIt was kind of disorienting to me, he said of the digital format. cI know a lot of people who did not finish or said they only got halfway. , At least one test coach, ArborBridge, is urging its clients to avoid online tests if they have the option, saying too little is known about the testing setup and interface. ,  cNo one wants to be a guinea pig, said Megan Stubbendeck, ArborBridge 9s senior director of instruction. , That prospect apparently does not faze the juniors in Enid. ,  cI personally am nervous, said Kassidy Diel, junior class secretary, who is aiming for Oklahoma State University and a career in veterinary medicine. But she admitted that is just her mind-set about tests. ,  cEverybody has taken at least one big test online, she said. cI think they know what to expect.  ",

            "article": "  **GREEN**  By Sam Graham-Felsen  301 pp. Random House. $27. ,  cGreen, the debut novel from Sam Graham-Felsen, who was chief blogger for Barack Obama 9s 2008 presidential campaign, chronicles the middle school travails of an anomalous variety of minority student. cI am the white boy at the Martin Luther King Middle, is how 12-year-old David Alexander Greenfeld, nicknamed Green, introduces himself in the novel 9s opening line. Martin Luther King Middle is a Boston public school 4 cmad ghetto, in Green 9s estimation 4 where his progressive parents have sent him for sixth grade. He 9s not the only white boy in the school, but the other one 4 his friend Kev, who 9s got lip scruff and spiky black hair along with prowess on the basketball court 4 often passes for Puerto Rican. There 9s no mistaking Green, though: not with his blue eyes and blond curls and constantly flushed cheeks, not with his monogrammed L. L. Bean backpack, not with his weakness for blurting the word cawesome ( ca Caucasian catastrophe, he notes). Almost all 12-year-olds are confused about who and what they are, but for David Greenfeld, at school, one conspicuous facet of his identity defines him: not his Green-ness, but his whiteness. , Hewing to the classic coming-of-age-novel formula, cGreen 9s Green experiences a variety of awakenings 4 sexual, religious, familial, moral and not surprisingly racial 4 during the course of his sixth-grade school year (1992-93), all of which get relayed in first-person, present- tense, slanged-up narration. The alarm clock for some of these awakenings is the friendship Green strikes with Marlon Wellings, a pious, studious black classmate who lives near Green in the Robert Gould Shaw Homes, a.k.a. cthe projects. Marlon, unlike Green, is mostly immune to social tensions, sitting by himself at lunchtime studying for the entrance exam to Boston Latin, the city 9s elite public school, where Green also aims to transfer. Green 9s first impression is that Marlon clooks pretty soft, and thus approachable: ccreased khakis, pilled-up flannel, boxy black shoes and a short, unkempt flattop, more like a clumpy cloud. He has a gap in his front teeth, just as Green does, but the similarities don 9t end there. The bond they form is based partly upon a clandestine love for the Boston Celtics 4 cno one openly admits they feel the Celtics anymore, Green says 4 and partly upon their shared desire for an upward move to Boston Latin. At Martin Luther King Middle they 9re outsiders, and both of them are desperate to get even farther outside. , The similarities do, however, bear some obvious endpoints. Green 9s Birkenstock-shod parents went to Harvard before embarking on a life of bobo activism ( cPops gives mad loot to Greenpeace d); Marlon 9s father is somewhere down South while his grandmother cares for him along with his mentally ill mother. Green and his 8-year-old brother, Benno, spend summers helping their parents tend a community garden plot; Marlon eats asparagus for the first time at Green 9s house and the resultant urine smell triggers a cancer panic. Green is a secular Jew, confounded by what that even means, while Marlon sings in the choir in a storefront church near the Roxbury border. Green 9s parents, if they would relax their principles, could conceivably send him to a safer private school (brother Benno, who recently stopped speaking, attends one such school cfor sensitive kids d); Marlon 9s grandmother is absent that option. And Marlon is black, while Green, glaringly, is white. , This dynamic 4 the white boy adrift in the urban and predominantly black school, the fraught cross-racial friendship that blooms there 4 isn 9t new to fiction. Jonathan Lethem probed it, with exquisite grace, in his 2003 novel cThe Fortress of Solitude. (A line from Lethem 9s novel, in fact, could serve as a 10-word summary of Green: cA white boy in sixth grade, squirming in the glare. d) Graham-Felsen isn 9t reaching for the same lofty heights as Lethem did (few novelists dare to), but he is reaching in the same general direction: toward the terribly thorny beauty at the heart of cross-racial friendships, which constitutes, per Leslie Fiedler and others, one of our essential American stories. These thorns keep getting denser and sharper as cGreen progresses, as when Green discovers that the pair 9s snow shoveling business is successful only when he approaches potential customers without Marlon in sight. What we call racism Green apprehends as cthe force d: its energies everywhere, cworking on everyone, himself included. When Green copies a couple of answers from Marlon during the fated entrance exam, the white proctor takes notice but lets it slide. cA sickening mix of relief and shame sweeps over me, says Green. cMar knows it and I do, too: I 9ve been saved by the force. , Moments like these 4 rendered subtly, without poster-size messaging 4 are when cGreen is at its most prickly and compelling. Scenes of innocence 4 Green and Marlon clowning in homemade pro-wrestler costumes, or watching VHS tapes of Larry Bird-era Celtics games from inside a living room fort made of blankets and chairs 4 serve as their delicately calibrated counterbalances, affecting in their sweetness but credible in their lack of saccharine. Graham-Felsen lets boys be boys: messy-brained, impulsive, goatish, self-centered, outwardly gutsy but often inwardly terrified. The voice with which Graham-Felsen equips Green, overseasoned with hip-hop slang, is the epitome of this. At first blush it suggests Holden Caulfield as translated by Vanilla Ice ( cIf I 9m gonna make another attempt to kick it to her, I 9m gonna need a new Machine, and for that I 9m gonna need to fatten my muenster stack, fast d). Yet as the novel advances, and this street stud pose starts splintering, the voice itself gathers a kind of dorky poignancy, the reader sensing an unseen wobble upon Green 9s stiff, pale lip. Is it linguistic blackface, with all that implies, or a 12-year- old 9s guileless attempt to cobble together a voice of his own from what 9s nearest at hand? cI wish I had what he has, Green says of Marlon at one point. He 9s talking about religion, but it could be identity or maybe identity 9s midwife, community. cAll I came up with was confusion. , Yet this reader found himself wishing for something of Marlon 9s, too: _his_ awakenings, _his_ perspective, _his_ inner voice, _his_ fullness on the page. As Lethem wrote in cThe Fortress of Solitude d: cThe white kid has one set of feelings, the black kid another. That we aren 9t privy to those feelings owes less to malpractice than to the inherent limitations of Graham-Felsen telling this story through Green 9s blue eyes. Marlon only exists within Green 9s purview, which means that cGreen 4 and by extension the reader 4 sees only a fraction of the whole. cWe match up in a million soft little ways 4 why can 9t we just be boys again? Green laments near the end, when the friendship has run aground. cBut the more I think about it, the more I wonder if we were meant to be shards from the start. Not just me and Mar 4 everyone. Look around. \\u2026 The force is everywhere, prying us apart. There 9s more hopefulness than this by the final pages, but it 9s a long-shot hope, a coin into a fountain. He and Marlon match up in a million ways save one, but that one, in America then as now, seems cursed to outweigh all the others.  ",

            "article": " When Garett A. Holm began his first day of law school in Tucson he wasn 9t especially concerned that people would ask his age, which was 41. , But he was braced for the possibility that someone might ask which admissions test he had taken 4 the traditional one law schools have used for more than half a century, or the test taken by students applying to almost all other graduate programs. , Why that matters speaks to an upheaval of sorts going on at most law schools around the country, which have faced plummeting enrollment for several years. Although they are beginning to recover, the fallow period led them to explore ways to find new pools of potential students. , One of the solutions, many decided, was to make a change in admission requirements. They would no longer rely solely on the Law School Admission Test, or LSAT, which has been considered the surest predictor of how a student will fare in coursework. As an alternative, they would consider performance on the Graduate Record Exam. Accepting it could allow many more students to get into law school, proponents of the change said. , One test versus another might seem like a less than radical reason for debate. , But some defenders of the traditional test say the change amounts to a dangerous lowering of standards and could allow too many students to enroll in law school who would be unable to pass the lawyer licensing exam. , Many deans, however, want to rid themselves of some constraints on their admissions policies. They seek more flexibility to admit candidates they think are promising but who do not necessarily fit a conventional profile. , A showdown of sorts is set for later this month when the American Bar Association 9s accrediting body plans to hold a public hearing where both sides can air their views. , The University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, in Tucson, where Mr. Holm is a student, was a leader in moving beyond the LSAT requirement. In 2016, the school said it would allow applicants to present results of the GRE, which is taken around the world by about six times more students than the 126,000 or so who take the LSAT annually. , Test scores are combined with other measures, including grade-point average, to admit students for the three-year juris doctoral degree. , Some schools value the LSAT 9s record of predictability and will keep the test, but many law schools care looking to innovate and experiment, said Christopher P. Chapman, president and chief executive of AccessLex Institute(https://www.accesslex.org/management-team), the nonprofit organization representing most of the more than 200 accredited law schools. , Supporters of the LSAT, administered since 1948, say they believe it already allows law schools to take into account a broad spectrum of education and experiences in deciding who can study to become a lawyer. ,  cIt provides a common measure for all applicants, said Christina B. Whitman, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and chairman of the board of trustees of the Law School Admissions Council(https://www.lsac.org/), which oversees the LSAT. cHow else could admissions directors evaluate students, like me, who attended massive state universities, she said. . , Nearly 20 law schools, including Harvard 9s, have embraced the GRE as an alternative. More than 150 law school deans, including those from many elite schools that had no shortage of applicants, vigorously backed Arizona 9s effort two years ago to introduce the alternative. , In March, the Education Testing Service, the Princeton, N.J., organization that administers the GRE and other standardized tests, unveiled a tool to help schools compare the results of the GRE and the LSAT. , Supporters of the GRE say fewer restrictions will make law school more readily available to people of more varied backgrounds as well as more races, ethnicities and income levels to offset the small percentages of minorities in law school. Black and African Americans make up only about 8.5 percent of law students; Asians and Hispanics make up an additional 20 percent of law students in 2017. , Arizona has admitted students with academic backgrounds in disciplines like math, engineering and science who had not typically considered law school as an educational path. , Many are older than their early to mid-20s, which was once a more traditional age to enter law school, and already have graduate degrees and skills from previous careers. ,  cA number of them are people in mid-careers, with families, looking for a career change, said Marc L. Miller, the school 9s dean. cHalf or more are making a career shift, from disciplines like accounting or careers in the military, he said, adding, cWe have a Ph.D. chemist, a geneticist and a doctoral student in rhetoric. , Students with such academic backgrounds often test well on the LSAT, where scores of 160 or higher are generally considered desirable for law school admissions. But they frequently choose the GRE because it can be used to apply to graduate and business schools as well as some law schools. , So far, Arizona has enrolled 25 students 4 12 in the first year and 13 in the second year 4 who applied on the basis of their GRE scores. It is too early to tell how they will fare because the first group of students will not take their state licensing exams until next year 4 after they receive their degrees. , Mr. Miller said the students care randomly distributed around the classes, which have around 80 people each, and their performance is well within what we normally see. , In the first group, he said, many seemed to avoid saying they had taken only the GRE. cBut by the second class, no one was the least bit worried to say so. , Mr. Holm, who has been a teacher, nonprofit executive and a budget official, said he was never asked about what test he took. ,  cIt was hard enough being the first, recalled Mr. Holm, about his early law student days, cbut I was mindful that there was a stigma that someone might not be qualified enough.

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News) Virtually nowhere in the United States do black boys grow up to earn incomes equivalent to white boys raised in the same neighborhoods by parents with comparable wealth and education levels, according to a study released Monday(http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/) that followed millions of children now in their late 30s or turning 40.\\xa0 The disparity holds true even for black boys raised in the wealthiest of families, who grew up on the same block in the same affluent community and attended the same school as their white counterparts. The findings shows that race -- not just parental income or neighborhood opportunities -- factors into the yawning wealth gap(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and- hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind- whites/?utm_term=.39a115133188) between blacks and whites in America. In addition to income, black boys were more likely to be incarcerated and less likely to attend college than their white counterparts from families of similar income level.  cRace matters, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist who co- authored\\xa0the paper with Raj Chetty at Stanford and two researchers with the U.S. Census Bureau. cParent income and neighborhoods cannot explain the entirety of the black-white gap. Even when your parents get rich, the gaps don 9t go away. The gap actually increased at the upper end of the income spectrum, a finding that surprised the researchers. In 99 percent of U.S. Census tracts, white boys grew up to earn more than black boys. The average gap for individual wages was about $9,000 for men from low-income families, Hendren said. That gap widened to an average of roughly $11,000 for men from affluent families. Among the wealthiest families, black sons of millionaires typically earned an individual annual income of between $40,000 and $45,000 at age 35, while white sons of millionaires earned between $50,000 and $55,000, Hendren said. The household income gap was wider and was largely explained by the higher marriage rates among whites, he said.  cThe racial divide is something that permeates the backyards of every community in America, in both affluent and poorer neighborhoods, Hendren said. cIn fact, the gap is even larger in affluent neighborhoods with better schools. The income disparity was driven entirely by men, researchers found -- with the gap virtually erased for women raised by parents of similar income levels. Black and white women with comparable family backgrounds grew up to attend college at near identical levels, worked similar hours, and earned closely equivalent wages. Both black and white daughters of millionaires earned an average of around $38,500 a year at age 35. Boys born into high-income black families were much more likely to experience downward economic mobility than similarly situated whites across generations, the study said. A black child born to parents in the top 20th percentile of the income distribution was as likely to fall to the bottom quintile as he was to remain in the top. But white boys\\xa0were\\xa0nearly five times as likely to remain in the top quintile as they were to fall to the bottom. As for what accounts for the disparities in upward mobility, the researchers do not have a clear answer. Social scientists and policy makers have suggested better educational opportunities, even marriage, as the key. But neither explains the intergenerational income gap between black and white children from similar backgrounds. In the neighborhoods with low poverty rates where the gap is smallest, researchers identified two common traits: black fathers were more likely to be present in the communities and racial bias among whites, as measured by online psychological tests, was lower. The presence of black fathers predicted the outcome of black boys regardless of whether a boy 9s own father was present. But less than 5 percent of black children grow up in low-poverty environments with more than half of black fathers present, the study found, whereas 63 percent of white children are raised in communities with a high presence of white fathers. Researchers suggested several policy considerations to close the intergenerational gap, including moving black families to better neighborhoods or replicating those conditions across the country with mentoring programs for black boys and efforts to reduce racial bias among whites. The study relied upon newly available longitudinal Census data covering nearly the entire U.S. population between 1989 and 2015 as well as federal tax returns. Researchers followed a cohort of 20 million children born in the U.S. between 1978 and 1983 or legal immigrants who came to the country as children.  ",

Consider women and college graduates, who have flocked to the Democratic Party in recent years. , A larger share of college graduates identify as or lean Democratic than at any point in the past quarter-century, according to a new Pew Research Center report(http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing- educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/) based on more than 10,000 interviews with registered voters last year. The data tell a similar story for women, too. , Republicans have gained some ground, too, among older registered voters and those with a high school education or less. , Here 9s a brief look at the findings of the Pew analysis, which was released this week. , Americans are more divided along educational lines than at any point in about a quarter-century, according to Pew. , That 9s thanks largely to a realignment among two groups: those with only a high school diploma and those who have completed college. , In 1992, 55 percent of registered voters with no more than a high school education identified or leaned toward the Democratic Party, while only 37 percent sided with Republicans. Today, the group shows a slight preference for the Republican Party. , The exact opposite is true for Americans with at least a college degree, whose slight preference for Republicans in 1992 has since flipped. Today, about 58 percent side with Democrats, and only 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party. , That divergence was most pronounced among registered voters who had pursued a postgraduate education: Once split in their political preferences, they are now twice as likely to align with Democrats as with Republicans. , Women have long been more likely to side with the Democratic Party than with Republicans, but the gap in preference expanded in recent years, to 19 percentage points in 2017 from 12 points in 2015. , Most of that growth, however, comes not from women who now identify as Democrats, but those who find themselves leaning toward the party, according to Pew. , And the gap is widest among millennial women, who are three times as likely to identify or lean Democratic as Republican: In 2017, 70 percent of millennial women sided with Democrats, while just 23 percent preferred Republicans. , That gap is more than two times as large as it was in 2014. , But not all women have moved toward the Democrats. Support for Republicans has steadily risen among women in the Silent Generation, defined by Pew as those born from 1928 to 1945. Today, 48 percent of those women side with Republicans, while 46 percent align with Democrats.  ",

In late 2015, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, the NCLB successor law that gave states some flexibility about how they could devise systems that would hold districts accountable for meeting student performance requirements in ESSA. So what are states doing? Are they taking advantage of that flexibility to back away from the worst parts of No Child Left Behind? Each state plan must be approved by the U.S. Education Department, and so far 33 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have seen their blueprints approved. Democrats in the Senate have expressed concern about the approvals, saying that the department is giving states a pass to do what they what 4 regardless of whether the accountability plans comply with ESSA. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), head of the Senate Education Committee, has praised the department in this regard. In this post, Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair & Open Testing(http://www.fairtest.org), a nonprofit group\\xa0known as FairTest that works to end the abuse of standardized tests, analyzes the first 16 state plans that were approved by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. _ Efforts to reduce standardized testing succeeded in many school districts in 2017. Here 9s why and how. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/06/efforts-to-reduce-standardized-testing-succeeded- in-many-school-districts-in-2017-heres-why-and-how/?utm_term=.6aa8dc282d94)_ _**By Monty Neill**_ Have states taken advantage of the new federal education law 9s flexibility on accountability to overcome the destructive legacy of No Child Left Behind (NCLB)? A just-completed review of the first 16 approved state Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plans by the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (http://www.fairtest.org)shows limited progress. Most positively, 10 of the 16 states abandoned NCLB 9s failed test-and- punish policies, such as firing staff or closing or privatizing schools for low standardized exam scores. On the other hand, states have not taken sufficient advantage of ESSA 9s opportunities to improve assessment and accountability. If every state adopted the best practices pioneered by some jurisdictions, U.S. public schools could make faster progress toward developing helpful, not harmful, accountability systems. The FairTest analysis examined five basic components of state ESSA plans and considered three other related issues. You can find additional detail and recommendations in our report and state-by-state chart, available here(http://fairtest.org/State-ESSA-Plans-Report-2018) and below. Here are findings from a review of these states: Arizona, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont. 1) **_States have selected a narrow range of school quality/student success indicators, many of which are standardized test scores._** _States should develop a richer array of indicators_. A few states include factors such as adequate funding, school climate, student or parent engagement, reductions in punitive discipline, access to a well-rounded curriculum, and access to resources such as counselors, librarians and wraparound services for students and families. 2) **_Most states give much less weight to school quality/student success than they should_. ** Combined with the narrow range of indicators, this means states remain too heavily focused on reading/English language arts and math test scores. As a result, schools will continue to feel pressure to focus on test preparation, to the detriment of a richer education. _States should increase the weight of school quality/student success indicators,_ such as those listed above, to at least 40 percent, as a few states have done, in addition to broadening the indicators. (ESSA requires that non-school quality/student success indicators should have csignificantly greater weighting than school quality/student success indicators.) 3)\\xa0 ** _Many states have created school ranking categories or levels beyond the three required by ESSA._** The required categories are schools in need of comprehensive (schoolwide) support and improvement (CSI), those in need of targeted (to groups of students) support and improvement (TSI), and all others. Of the 16 states, six require only three levels, three have four levels, and six use five levels. (Most states using five levels rank schools with a letter grade of A through F.) Levels will perpetuate unhealthy competition because the primary factor for determining a school 9s level remains standardized tests. Schools may focus narrowly on boosting test scores to cbeat other schools, thereby undermining a richer curriculum. _States with more than three levels should cut back to just three._ 4) **_Six of the 16 states retain some of NCLB 9s punitive sanctions_ , **though most of them do so only if initial improvement efforts have not succeeded after about three years 4 which is too short a time span. The remaining 10 states plan to provide assistance to struggling schools. If that is unsuccessful, they will increase the assistance, rather than impose punishments, as NCLB required. **_This is the most positive finding from FairTest 9s review_.** _States should abandon punitive NCLB mandates._ If after six years serious problems remain, states should determine why they persist and intervene appropriately. 5) **_Some states attach punitive consequences to ESSA 9s requirement that schools test 95 percent of their students with federally mandated state exams._** The U.S. Department of Education expects states to factor participation into state plans and school ratings. This means a good school could be put in a lower level, even identified at different levels of needing improvement (CSI or TSI), if more than 5 percent of students opt out of testing. Further, 14 of the 16 states mandate additional actions. In eight, it means only a plan to improve participation or some unspecified intervention. But in six the state will do such things as lower a school 9s ranking by a level, even if it has already dropped once due to insufficient participation. _This goes beyond ESSA requirements and punishes schools for the actions of parents._ _States should do no more than report the 95 percent participation rate._ They should not penalize schools placed in lower levels because of opt-out percentages. Louisiana plans no further actions. New York and New Jersey will calculate average scores based only on actual test takers and use that data in deciding support and interventions. Colorado and Utah are also seeking to be non-punitive. (New York, New Jersey, Colorado and Utah have had strong opt-out movements.) 6) **_New Hampshire intends to rely heavily on performance assessments,_ ** expanding a pilot project in which local assessments can be used instead of state tests in all but three grades. (See cAssessment Matters: Constructing Model State Systems to Replace Testing Overkill, at <http://www.fairtest.org/assessment-matters-constructing-model-state-system>.) Other states may choose to go this route via ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot. _States should prepare for participation in ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot_ and encourage districts to implement teacher-led performance assessing. 7) **_States do not go beyond ESSA 9s requirement to report school finance data, including per-student expenditures, to say what they will do if funding is inadequate._** The reporting will shed light on inadequate resources, a fundamental problem for many schools. However, _states are not required to do anything substantive with this information_. Failure to address this problem leaves states off the hook for funding equity and adequacy. _States should go beyond ESSA requirements to mandate that funding data be included in a school 9s needs assessment_ _and that states commit to addressing inadequate funding._ 8) **_State plans are insufficiently complete about how they will tally standardized exam volumes and track consequences._** ESSA requires reporting on what standardized tests states, districts and schools administer. It also authorizes use of its funds to conduct state and district audits of the amount of testing. _States should conduct_ _audits and monitor districts and schools to ensure they publicly report all standardized tests they administer._ FairTest 9s analysis concludes that education policymakers as well as reform advocates should model their own plans on elements of other states 9 federally approved plans that take advantage of ESSA flexibility. States should adopt a rich array of indicators, minimize the use of test scores, then weight school quality/student success indicators at 40 percent or more. They can sort schools into just three levels. They can include funding adequacy in needs assessments, then move their state to provide sufficient resources to all schools. States can drop punitive sanctions and focus on genuine assistance. States can also refuse to add penalties for low test participation. Some states may be reluctant to take these steps. In that case, advocates, from parent and community organizations to unions and professional associations, will need to exert pressure to win meaningful assessment reforms.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump 9s Education Department is on its way to delaying by two years the implementation of an Obama-era rule that is intended to address the disparities in the treatment of students of color with disabilities. The rule amended regulations that are part of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). John King, the U.S. education secretary in December 2016, said then: > cChildren with disabilities are often disproportionately and unfairly suspended and expelled from school and educated in classrooms separate from their peers. Children of color with disabilities are overrepresented within the special education population, and the contrast in how frequently they are disciplined is even starker. Current Education Secretary Betsy Devos is not a fan of the rule, and last month, the Education Department published a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment on a proposal to delay the rule 9s implementation, which was supposed to start in the 2018-2019 school year. The notice says the department wants to make this move to ensure the rule 9s ceffectiveness can be ensured. The cEquity in IDEA rule is just one of a number of Obama-era regulations\\xa0 aimed at protecting the rights of students that the Trump administration has either rolled back or expressed interest in doing so. In this post, a special education expert explains why delaying the rule 4\\xa0 is such a bad idea. It was written by Catherine Kramarczuk Voulgarides, an assistant professor of special education at Touro College in New York City. She has a book coming out in April of 2018 entitled: cDoes Compliance Matter in Special Education? IDEA and the Hidden Inequities of Practice.  (https://www.tcpress.com/does-compliance-matter-in-special- education-9780807759011) _ DeVos moves to delay Obama-era rule on minority special-education students (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/02/26/devos- delaying-obama-era-rule-on-minority-special-education- students/?utm_term=.d0626c1d127b)_ By Catherine Kramarczuk Voulgarides Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is moving to impose a two-year delay on the Equity in IDEA(https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-equity- idea) rules, which would have gone into effect in July 2018.\\xa0 The delay in implementation will, at best, promote the status quo in special education 4 which has been characterized by decades of racialized outcomes in the placement, classification, and/or discipline of students with disabilities 4 or will exacerbate these inequities. The department stated its reasons for the proposed delay in the Federal Register\\xa0 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102 /assistance-to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities- preschool-grants-for-children)on Feb. 27, 2018, but minimized the civil-rights issue that is central to disproportionality in special education. Students of color 4 primarily Native American, black, and Latino students 4 have historically been marginalized in the United State education system through questionable special education placement, classification, and/or disciplinary outcomes as compared to their white counterparts. Minimizing the civil-rights issue that is at the heart of disproportionality is a mistake. One reason provided in the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)that justifies a delay states: > cThe Department lacks the statutory authority under IDEA to require States to use a standard methodology to determine significant disproportionality, pointing out as well that the Department 9s previous position, adopted in the 2006 regulations implementing the 2004 amendments to IDEA, was that States are in the best position to evaluate factors affecting determinations of significant disproportionality. While the logic surrounding state rights is deeply tied to the educational federalism that influences our educational system, it does not engage with the gravity of the civil-rights concerns that are associated with racially disproportionate outcomes. It is not a coincidence that racial disparities in special education mirror broader educational opportunity gaps. The history, tenor, and reality of race relations in the United States infiltrates each school building and classroom of this nation. And it manifests, whether explicitly or not, in our day-to-day educational practices. Denying this reality by not labeling disproportionality as a civil-rights concern does a disservice to our youth. And a focus on preserving states 9 rights fails to recognize how the historical conditions and realities of schooling in the United States, and the resulting interactional and structural opportunity gaps, have systematically disadvantaged Native American, black, and Latino students. Relying upon a racially neutral policy approach that preserves state rights will not sufficiently counter these inequities. And yes, while there are qualitative differences between the educational climate, context, and needs of students in rural Montana, versus Atlanta, versus Philadelphia, versus Seattle,\\xa0 versus Tucson 4 to name a few 4 it is also a fact that each of these locales is linked to a broader American history characterized by a legacy of racial discrimination and institutional racism that has severely limited educational access and opportunity to primarily Native American, Black, and Latinx students in schools across the United States. The state rights argument also defies the findings (http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1044207311407917)and suggestions of both policy and research reports which have shown that when states have latitude to decide upon how they will identify and address disproportionality, the issue is not resolved and it seems to cexist in some states more so than others. For example,\\xa0 a 2013 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-137)found that out of the 356 districts identified as having significant disproportionality, chalf of these districts were clustered in five states and 73 were in Louisiana alone. The report further said that the way csome states defined overrepresentation made it unlikely that any districts would be identified within these states. This is perplexing. Do the findings in the GAO report(https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-137) imply that only some states have issues with racial inequities in special education and others do not? This is hard to believe. Even harder to believe, the Federal Register notice alludes to these findings, but it still positions states 9 rights as a valid reason to delay the regulations. Another reason provided in the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)that justifies the delay points to a tension between the individualized spirit of IDEA and the call for an aggregate measure that identifies racially disproportionate outcomes. The Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-04102/assistance- to-states-for-the-education-of-children-with-disabilities-preschool-grants- for-children)notice states: > The standard methodology for significant disproportionality improperly looks at group outcomes through statistical measures rather than focusing on what is at the foundation of IDEA, namely the needs of each individual child and on the appropriateness of individual identifications, placements, or discipline. Essentially, the language reads as if tracking an aggregate outcome (such as disproportionality) is contradictory to the spirit of IDEA, which is focused on providing a continuum of educational services to students with disabilities through their respective Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). I have two critiques of this reasoning which highlight, again, how civil- rights concerns do not appear to be at the forefront of any decision to delay the Equity in IDEA(https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-equity- idea) rules. IDEA is governed by both IDEA statues and the logic of the 14th Amendment. These are both sources of federal rights that must be interpreted and implemented in schools and districts across the United States. Unfortunately though, although both race and disability are protected classes under the U.S. Constitution, only crace is subject to strict scrutiny. Disability status is not. Thus, remedying a problem such as disproportionality, which exists at the intersection of disability and race, is incredibly difficult to achieve under the current legal framework. It also highlights a very complex problem that has serious equity implications. In this 2017 article(https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4721&context=caselrev), Natasha Strassfeld states: > As state policy monitoring of disproportionality has been found to either inadequately define or find evidence of significant disproportionality across states, potential claimants have relied on litigation to show intentional discrimination. Plaintiffs, however, face an uphill battle in using school- and district-level placement data to prove intentional discrimination, even when policy monitoring under IDEA has led to a finding that significant disproportionality by race or ethnicity in special education and related services has occurred within the plaintiff 9s district. Essentially, it is very difficult to prove that educators, a school, and/or school district has/had an explicit intent to discriminate when disproportionate outcomes are present. And it is especially true when/if schools and school districts are able to show compliance with IDEA statutes. This leads to my second point, and the most consequential one yet in regards to civil-rights protections and IDEA. Arguably, when a school or school district can show that they have complied with IDEA and that there is no evidence of explicit discrimination, then a racialized outcome such as disproportionality cannot be the fault of educators, biases and beliefs, organizational systems, and/or historical and contextual conditions. This reasoning theoretically allows for unequal educational outcomes to be blamed on students and families because, under the guise of compliance with IDEA, educators are not explicitly discriminating against students of color labeled with a disability, even if racial inequities are present. Essentially, a student 9s lack of success in school becomes their own fault, an individual issue, rather than one that is related to broader systemic factors. Thus, arguing that a focus on a group-based outcome is counter to the individualized spirit of IDEA further reifies a deficit-based logic that holds students accountable for school failure, and no one else. This is conceptually dangerous. Didn 9t civil-rights legal strategies and the logic found in _Brown vs. Board of Education_ influence the legislative development of IDEA? _\\xa0_ Yes. Wasn 9t the disability rights movement a collective effort aimed at assuring that all students have equal access and opportunity to high quality educational services? Yes. If we sideline a collective concern like racial disproportionality, isn 9t this contrary to the spirit of IDEA? Yes, because the collective spirit of the legislation dissolves into an catomization of needs politics 4 as noted in this 2009 article(https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ887067) 4\\xa0 that upholds individual concerns over collective ones. In summary, we need to identify educational policy and practice remedies that seriously contend with the historical and social contexts that define the United States education system. If we don 9t, we exhibit a concerning historical amnesia that denies the salience of race in American society and on educational outcomes. This amnesia also promotes a form of complicit compliance with IDEA whereby we are able to comply with educational systems that, with very little effort on our part, continuously reproduce racialized outcomes without having to face any consequences. Because of this, it is not in the best interests of students across this country to be educated in schools and school districts that are not using a standardized measure to track racialized outcomes in special education.

            "article": "  Education protects white women from losing their babies in infancy. The more education they have, the lower the infant mortality rate. Strangely, though, it 9s the opposite for black women. The most educated face the greatest risk of having their children die at birth or in infancy. Stress from dealing with racism and sexism seems to be a key reason that highly educated black women are far more likely lose their babies than are equally educated white women, says Keisha\\xa0Bentley-Edwards, a co-author of a new report, which is titled cFighting at Birth: Eradicating the Black- White Infant Mortality Gap. The stress can lead to premature delivery of low birth-weight babies. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWAXZozJqUpQ/v0/60x-1.png) Duke University, Insight Center for Community Economic Development  cWhen you 9re the only black woman in the room, when you 9re often working in\\xa0elite circles where you are the first or you are the only, there is a toll to be paid, says Bentley-Edwards. Herself a\\xa0black woman with a doctorate, she is a professor of general internal medicine at Duke University, as well as associate research director at Duke 9s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity. The research was done in concert with the\\xa0Insight Center for Community Economic Development in Oakland, Calif.     The findings of cFighting at Birth aren 9t entirely new. Researchers have known for decades that black mothers 9\\xa0infant mortality rate is about twice that of white women, and that black women don 9t get the same protection from education and higher socioeconomic status that white women do. Even many black women who have attained high rank carry the legacy of a lifetime of struggle. Damage to the body from stress, known as cweathering, has wide-ranging health effects that may manifest themselves during pregnancy.     Bentley-Edwards says the report makes two contributions. It puts all the research together in what she calls a\\xa0 cdigestible form. And it advocates for solutions that the medical establishment has resisted. Bentley- Edwards says doctors and public-health officials tend to focus their efforts on\\xa0poor women, regardless of their race. That 9s a worthy effort, but it does nothing for black women who aren 9t poor but nonetheless\\xa0are at grave risk of losing their newborn babies.  cThis is a push for a policy that 9s directed at black women specifically, she says. The extremely high rate of infant mortality for black women with doctorates or professional degrees raises the question of whether there 9s a fluke in\\xa0the data. After all, there are relatively few black women with advanced degrees that give\\xa0birth in any given year, and far fewer whose babies die in infancy. But Bentley-Edwards says statistical tests confirmed the result. And even if the disparity is somewhat smaller on average than these numbers show, the overall problem has been repeatedly confirmed by other researchers. Bentley-Edwards says the report should not be taken as a message to black women to think twice about getting an advanced education. cWe have to attack the stressor, she says. cEliminate job discrimination. We need allies to step in when we see a black woman at work not being treated the way she should be. The woman shouldn 9t feel guilty that she 9s complicit. It 9s not the education that 9s doing it.     Infant mortality rates have fallen for all races over the decades, but the rate for black women overall has remained about twice that of white women overall. White American women have the same risk as women in New Zealand, while black American women have the same risk as women in Romania or Thailand. Black\\xa0American women are far more likely to give birth prematurely, which is a major risk factor for infant mortality. Differences remain, even after accounting for factors such as poverty, obesity, age of mother, and illegal drug use. A 2015 study(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-015-9687-2) in the _Annals of Behavioral Medicine_ by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Wisconsin, and Emory University looked at markers\\xa0of inflammation in the body and found that cthe health ramifications\\xa0of high anger, or poorly controlled anger, may be stronger\\xa0in African Americans with more, compared to less, education. Last year, the _International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ published an  article(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678200) by researchers at Tulane University and other institutions that included interviews with 18 black women who had lost their children in infancy. Some\\xa0said that they felt the medical establishment was insensitive to their loss. cI mean, we planned her. We wanted her, one said. Another said, cIt 9s like, 8No! We are human. We care about our well- being just like you do. 9 Even tennis star Serena Williams had problems\\xa0when she gave birth. In her case, the life in danger was hers, not her child 9s. She told _Vogue_ magazine(https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview- february-2018)\\xa0that when she insisted on a CT scan to check for blood clots, a nurse told her that her pain medicine might be confusing her. She insisted on the scan and was proven correct. cI was like, 8listen to Dr. Williams! 9 she said. ProPublica\\xa0and NPR News last year co-published a story(https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from- dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth) that likewise focused on the risk of childbirth to black women. According to the Centers for Disease Control, it said,\\xa0black mothers in the U.S. die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.  cFighting at Birth is more prescriptive about black infant mortality than most previous\\xa0studies. It recommends support for programs and advocacy groups for black mothers; protocols to minimize bias by health- care providers; enforcement of laws against discrimination against black women; increased social support for expectant black women; and encouragement of breastfeeding, among other fixes.\\xa0   ",

            "article": " Disney said Monday it would donate $1 million of the proceeds from cBlack Panther to STEM programs at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, in a nod to one of the movie 9s key themes: how technology can empower young people from marginalized communities. , The blockbuster film is set in Wakanda, a country whose surplus of the fictional metal vibranium has enriched it tremendously. Many of the technologies in the film are invented or controlled by Shuri, the sister of T 9Challa, the Black Panther and Wakanda 9s king. Shuri, 16, plays a similar role to cQ from the James Bond films, providing her brother and the kingdom with vibranium-powered vehicles, weapons and other innovations. , In a statement, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, Robert A. Iger, said it was thrilling to see how much the technology in the film had excited young audiences. ,  cIt 9s fitting that we show our appreciation by helping advance STEM programs for youth, especially in underserved areas of the country, to give them the knowledge and tools to build the future they want, he said. , The $1 million pledged by Disney is only a fraction of the money that the film has brought in. In less than two weeks in theaters, cBlack Panther made more than $700 million worldwide(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/movies/black-panther-700 -million-globally-box-office.html), making it one of the fastest grossing films(https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/02/25/box-office- black-panther-tops-700m-with-record-breaking-2nd-weekend/618f2329213f) ever. , In a Twitter thread on Tuesday, the journalist Gene Demby, who writes and hosts a podcast about race for NPR, was dismissive of Disney 9s contribution, calling it(https://twitter.com/GeeDee215/status/968503958452035584) a crounding error. He wrote about how Disney has benefited from(https://twitter.com/GeeDee215/status/968497352863571968) enthusiasm about the merits of cBlack Panther and its representation of black people. , The Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a federated organization with independent clubs in cities around the country, said the money would be used to create new STEM innovation centers in 12 cities. (The acronym stands for science, technology, engineering and math.) Those cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Washington and Oakland, Calif., where the director of cBlack Panther, Ryan Coogler, was born and where some of the film takes place. , Chrissy Booth, the senior director of youth development programs for the organization, said the cities were target markets for Disney. The organization plans to evaluate critical need in those markets, as well as individual clubs 9 willingness to participate, before deciding which clubs in each city will receive the centers. , The organization 9s STEM curriculum gives young people the chance at an early age to have hands-on experiences, like building bridges and light bulbs and creating rock candy, Ms. Booth said. Children then move on to programs that focus on computer and environmental science and digital literacy. , The Boys & Girls Clubs worked with Partnerships in Education and Resilience, the education policy institute at Harvard University, and found that 12th graders in Boys and Girls Clubs were almost twice as likely than their peers to be interested in a STEM career. Fifty percent of girls who participated reported interest, compared with 12 percent of their peers nationwide. , Disney 9s donation imitates the end of the film (and in case it wasn 9t clear, **spoilers follow** ). Shuri and T 9Challa arrive in the United States, landing on a basketball court in Oakland. As a part of a new decree, T 9Challa places his sister in charge of global outreach around technology, giving underserved kids the chance to benefit from Wakanda 9s riches.  ",

            "article": " Our new Learning sections will feature a question-and-answer segment with an education expert. For our first installment, we 9ve chosen Sir Ken Robinson, a best-selling author and longtime advocate of transforming education. His latest book, cYou, Your Child, and School, was published in March by Viking. The following interview was edited and condensed. , **Your new book offers wide-ranging advice for parents as they try to manage their children 9s education. If you had to choose one takeaway, what would it be?** , Parents have more power and more choices than they may realize in educating their children. Many parents are worried about how the world is changing and the uncertain futures their children face. Parents are especially anxious about education. They worry that there 9s too much testing and competition, that the curriculum is too narrow, that their children are not treated as individuals and that schools are not cultivating their curiosity, confidence and creative talents. , They worry about how many young people are being medicated for clearning problems. They worry about the rising costs of college and whether their children will eventually find a job, whether or not they go to college. Often parents feel powerless to do anything about all of this. The good news is that a great many educators share these concerns and are also campaigning for change. , **While it 9s reasonable to lay heavy responsibility on parents for charting the path of their children 9s education, they are no match for the bureaucracy of any single school, let alone a state or federal Department of Education. How can parents expect to have any real impact?** , The challenges parents face and the options they have are naturally affected by their circumstances. Parents living in poor neighborhoods with limited resources face different challenges from those in wealthy suburbs with paid help. Some parents can pay for the education they want; most cannot. , In general, they have three options: They can work for changes within the current system, particularly in their children 9s own school; they can press for changes to the system; or they can educate their children outside the system. Whatever their circumstances, parents are not powerless and their voices must be heard. , **Is there one school system** **you think is doing things right? And if so, how?** , Governments everywhere are trying to improve education. For decades, the main strategies have been standardization, competition and incessant testing, especially in literacy, mathematics and science. It 9s been a partial success at best and in many ways a dismal failure. The story in Finland is different. , Finland is regularly at or near the top of international league tables in those disciplines but its success is much broader. Significantly, there is no mandated curriculum in Finland. Schools are encouraged to follow a broad curriculum that includes the arts, sciences, mathematics, languages, humanities and physical education. There is hardly any standardized testing. Finland invests heavily in the selection and training of teachers, and teaching is a high-status profession. , The Finnish system is not perfect and it 9s still evolving, but it 9s succeeding against a wide range of measures, where many other systems fall tragically short, and it 9s doing that by following a different path. , **You talk about the stress students are under these days. What 9s the best way for a parent to ease that stress, while still keeping their students competitive in a very tough and demanding global environment?** , In the United States, more than eight out of 10 teenagers experience extreme or moderate stress during the school year, including headaches, loss of sleep, anger and irritability. The main causes include anxieties about academic performance, the pressures of testing, and parental pressures to excel at school and get into a good college. , Many young people feel overscheduled with nearly every waking hour being assigned, plotted and planned with little time for just cbeing a kid. Parents can help in three ways: by learning to recognize the signs of ctoxic stress, by easing the pressures at home through encouraging more downtime and by working collectively with the school to reduce some of the avoidable causes of stress, including the often excessive levels of homework and testing. , **You have been critical** ** 4 as have many** ** 4 of standardized testing. If you could change it, how would you do it differently? End it altogether? Change the format? Do it less often? And if the last, how do you ensure that students are learning what they need to know?** , There was a time when school students could expect to take a few tests each year. Now they face a seemingly endless steeplechase of tests, sometimes starting in kindergarten. , High-stakes testing was meant to raise standards in education. Instead, it 9s generated a dreary culture of incessant competition, which has soaked up billions of taxpayer dollars with no significant improvement in standards, causing enormous stress for teachers, children and their families. Constructive assessment is an essential part of high-quality education, and some forms of diagnostic testing can be helpful. The usual forms of high stakes testing are neither constructive nor essential. , The proper purposes of assessment are to support and improve student learning and to provide an informative record of their achievements. There are many better ways to do this than through the barren rituals of bubble tests. , **What is your view of charter schools? Would you encourage or discourage their existence?** , Charter schools are independently operated public schools, which have freer rein than regular public schools in what they teach and how they are run. In themselves, they are neither better nor worse than ordinary public schools. Some are very successful, others less so. , One argument for charter schools is that they can invigorate the public sector by spreading new practices. Some do and some don 9t. Another is that they give parents more choice in education. The choice can be more apparent than real. All schools have limited spaces, and popular ones soon become oversubscribed. Either way, for most families, public schools are still their best opportunity in education. , **If you were the United States education secretary, what is the first thing you would do to change the American school system?** , What is education for? In my view, it is to enable all students to understand the world around them and the talents within them so that they can become fulfilled individuals and active, compassionate citizens. The proper role of government is to create the best conditions for that to happen. , If I were secretary, I would encourage all schools to adopt a broad and balanced curriculum including languages, math, the arts, sciences, humanities and physical education, and develop nonstatutory guidelines and resources to support them. I would roll back the current testing requirements in favor of more informative approaches to assessment. I would support the comprehensive development of early-years education. I would institute a csoup to nuts review of the selection, training and support of teachers. I would introduce incentives for creative partnerships between schools, families, cultural organizations and the private sector. , In these and other ways, education can and must change 4 for all our sakes.

That was the conclusion of a report from the Children's Commissioner,(https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/Growing-Up-North-March-2018-1.pdf) Anne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide?  There are varying levels of deprivation   There were higher proportions of children claiming free school meals(https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their- characteristics-january-2017) in the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017.    Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than \\xa37,400 a year excluding income from benefits.  * Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41983610) And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long- term, entrenched deprivation.  There are strong links between deprivation and how well children do at school The link between deprivation and how well children do at school(https://www.suttontrust.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/1Attainment_deprived_schools_summary.pdf) has been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a \"double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school\", she said.   * Northern children 'too often left behind'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43500164)   * Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38172816)  But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived.   He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. \"Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,\" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were \"overly impressed by schools' level of attainment\" rather than looking at children's progress.  * Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34964522) But even accounting for that, there are still regional differences when you look at how well schools are rated(https://public.tableau.com/profile/ofsted!/vizhome/Dataview/Viewregionalperformanceovertime) in the comparably deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber.  It's not as simple as north vs south In 2015, the government produced figures on multiple indices of deprivation(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465791 /English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Statistical_Release.pdf) looking at seven main things:   * Income   * Employment   * Health deprivation and disability   * Education, skills and training   * Barriers to housing and services   * Crime   * Living environment  And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as \"south=rich, north=poor\". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption East Jaywick in Essex came out as the most deprived town in England based on the government's multiple indices of deprivation  Is London a special case? Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country.   Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average.   But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government, starting from the mid- 1990s.(https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8006) In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment.  What about the money?   A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like:   * Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals   * Children in the care of the state   * Children with special education needs   * Children who speak English as an additional language   * Schools in areas with a high cost of living  The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving \\xa3500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.   ",

In this post, he writes about what he saw and offers advice to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who recently said on c60 Minutes that she had never cintentionally visited an underperforming school. **By Ted Dintersmith** In her recent c60 Minutes interview, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos indicated that perhaps she should visit more schools. Yes.\\xa0 She needs to get out of her bubble and visit schools across America.\\xa0 I did, and there 9s much to be learned. _ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stumbles during pointed 860 Minutes 9 interview (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2018/03/12/education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60 -minutes-interview/?utm_term=.04a9d1ac57f4)_ For context, I spent the entire 2015-2016 school year immersed in education across America.\\xa0 In a trip that rivaled de Toqueville 9s, I traveled to all 50 states, visited 200 schools of all types and talked to thousands of people about school. Questioning my sanity, friends asked, cWhy take such a grueling trip? d\\xa0 But as a career venture capitalist, I know that ever-advancing technology is gutting the economy of jobs and reshaping what 9s needed for career and citizenship.\\xa0 These disruptions have profound implications for the future of our children and our democracy.\\xa0 I wanted to see how schools might take on this challenge. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pjCMmhYl7sQJLao3Rab_jXwvvbs=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q5HFE6FPO43QDFHS73BRWQJRTM.jpg)  During my travels, I met with every element of our education ecosystem 4 governors, legislators, billionaires, school boards, college admissions, textbook and testing executives, bureaucrats, students, parents and teachers.\\xa0 I covered every geography, demographic and school type. I had no ax to grind, no bias to uphold. I just wanted to listen and learn. For an administration that relies on index cards with cI hear you reminders, here 9s what our secretary of education needs to hear. First, America 9s teachers are dedicated, passionate and committed 4 across all types of schools.\\xa0 They care.\\xa0 Many are distressed, even in tears. Like troops fighting an unwinnable war, our teachers know they 9re being held accountable to tests that don 9t reflect real learning, nor lead to important competencies. We are demoralizing our teaching force, driving our best to early retirement and dissuading young adults from the profession that will shape our nation 9s future. Second, I was blown away by the many inspiring examples of great innovation I encountered 4 in classrooms, schools, districts and states.\\xa0 In these classrooms, teachers help kids develop essential skill sets and mindsets. Instead of checking off endless content boxes (AP U.S. History, for example, covers five centuries, allowing a whopping 30 minutes for the U.S. Constitution), students master what they learn, apply it and teach others.\\xa0 Much of the learning is hands-on, tied to real-world projects.\\xa0 Students have voice in creating initiatives and in defining their path forward. Teachers are trusted, and students approach schoolwork with a sense of purpose. Third, I didn 9t find charter schools to be, on balance, more innovative than public schools. Some of the most remarkable innovations I observed were in the very public schools that choice advocates dismiss 4 in places such as Charlotte, Newark, Coachella and Waipahu.\\xa0 And while some charter schools are deeply innovative, many grind away on test scores, with innovation limited to cute test-prep jingles. Free of regulation, you might think private schools would lead the way in innovation, but most are focused on the college application process, a serious impediment to innovation. Fourth, we fail to appreciate the heavy price our students and our teachers pay when we insist, cWe have to be able to measure it. In the early grades, I admired places that made thoughtful, diagnostic use of standardized tests to ensure young kids develop core learning skills. But in U.S. education, the higher the grade, the higher the testing stakes, with myriad adverse consequences. These bulk tests 4 SAT 9s, ACT 9s, AP exams, and especially state-mandated tests 4 are packed with questions tied to content retention, low-level procedures and formulaic thinking. In contrast, the better-designed OECD PISA tests comprise thought- provoking questions.\\xa0 So while U.S. kids lead the world in test prep, our testing regimen values the exact skills automation excels at, rather than teaching kids to think. Fifth, I met thousands of children during my trip.\\xa0 Not one showed any enthusiasm for test prep.\\xa0 But I met many parents, especially the affluent, who relentlessly push test prep on their child, drawing on tutors, pricey devices and manipulative bribes.\\xa0 This difference helps explain why in- poverty kids lag affluent cohorts in test-score cachievement. d\\xa0 To a large extent, test-score performance reflects the motivation and resources of the parent, not the child. Sixth, I was encouraged to visit districts, and even states, that are transforming their schools 4 all of their schools.\\xa0 Their leaders bring a compelling message about the urgency of change and lay out aspirational possibilities.\\xa0 They prioritize essential competencies, not state-mandated tests and obsolete curriculum.\\xa0 They trust teachers to lead the way, both in managing classrooms and designing next-generation assessments. They energize their community, enlisting support in the aspirational goal of helping schools rise to 21st-century challenges. These leaders inspire confidence and exude competence. Seventh, DeVos might be surprised at my conclusions about cthe very powerful forces allied against change she alludes to. In U.S. education, nonexperts tell experts what to do.\\xa0 Priorities are set by legislators, billionaires, textbook and testing executives, college admissions officers and education bureaucrats.\\xa0 These forces, perhaps unintentionally, impede real change in our schools.\\xa0 They push kids to study what 9s easy to measure, not what 9s important to learn. No worries that a steady diet of memorizing content and drilling on low-level procedures produces young adults who are sitting ducks in the innovation economy.\\xa0 Put all the chips on college-ready, discounting the importance of hands-on learning and discouraging those with non-academic proficiencies.\\xa0 Channel kids down the same standardized path, impairing their ability to leave school able to create and develop their own path forward 4 arguably the most important competence young adults need in a world where careers come and go. Finally, business principles aren 9t the key to improving U.S. education.\\xa0 If choice and competition improve schools, I found no sign of it. Pitting schools against each other in a test-score cHunger Games drags everyone down. I saw no sign of union status affecting a teacher 9s dedication or effectiveness. There is, though, one business principle that applies to education.\\xa0 If you want insight, spend time with those in the trenches.\\xa0 Our teachers know how to engage our children, to inspire them to race ahead, to prepare them for adult life. With the futures of millions of children at stake, we need to listen to our innovative teachers and trust them to be the powerful forces for informed, aspirational change in our schools. **Read more:** _ A venture capitalist searches for the purpose of school.

Promoted by the Kremlin as a model for grooming talent, Sirius runs 600 exceptional students a month through intensive courses in everything from physics and coding to chess and ballet. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iz6lJk3zbNwQ/v7/60x-1.jpg) Letovo\\xa0school Source: Letovo  cThe more intelligent and educated people are, the less aggressive they are, Putin, a self-confessed street thug in his youth, told the children last July.     Putin 9s own aggression on the world stage has become an unexpected\\xa0catalyst for an investment boom in Russian education. As U.S. and European leaders continue to work to isolate Russia\\xa0over alleged election meddling and the conflict in Ukraine, a growing number of tycoons are pulling their children out of western schools and putting money into private projects that will aid Putin 9s attempts to reverse a decline in national academic rankings. Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine a month after the Sochi Olympics, more than 30 billionaires and senior executives with investments abroad have founded or helped fund projects to nurture students at home. The outlays coincide\\xa0with a halving in the number of new Russian enrollments at boarding schools in Britain, long the educational destination of choice for the country 9s elite, to 608 last year, according to the U.K. Independent Schools Council.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs Herman Gref, head of state savings bank Sberbank, opened a school called Horoshkola with his wife Yana in Moscow in September, joining billionaire Suleyman Kerimov 9s Zarechenskaya\\xa0Shkola and transport tycoon Nikita Mishin 9s Novaya Shkola.

Even his youngest son won 9t be admitted unless he passes the blindly graded entrance exam like everyone else, he said.  cI 9m not building a school for children of officials or sanctioned businessmen or oligarchs from Rublyovka, Moshkovich said in an interview, referring to one of Moscow 9s poshest districts. cEducation is the key driver in the modern world and I want Russia to be competitive. This is for soul and country.     The first nation in space has fallen behind relative newcomers in math and science, mainly from Asia. A top six finisher in the pre-college International Mathematical Olympiad every year until 2015, Russia tumbled to a worst-ever 11th last year, behind upstarts like Vietnam, Iran and Thailand. On a broader level, Russia is middling, ranking 32nd out of the 72 countries in the PISA exam of 15-year-olds, far behind Estonia, a fellow former Soviet republic.   The World Bank warned in November that low government\\xa0spending on education and health in Russia ``may jeopardize both economic growth and the well-being of the population. 9 9 Russia spends about\\xa03.6 percent of economic output on each category,\\xa0compared with 4.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, in the European Union, the Washington-based lender said. Retooling the educational system after communism 9s failure remains a work in progress. Critics like Moshkovich, who got his graduate degree from the Moscow Institute of Radio, Electronics and Automatics, say low morale and chronic underfunding 4even the best teachers can earn less than $250 a month 4are just parts of the problem. They say state primary and secondary schools still rely too much on memorization and standardized testing and don 9t do enough to encourage critical and creative thinking.  cThere 9s no other project like it in Russia Moshkovich, 50, who made his fortune in sugar and pork, retired from the senate in 2014 to focus\\xa0on education. He 9s hoping the methods he 9s developing at Letovo will stimulate reforms nationwide. His school will offer students both a Russian diploma and a certificate from\\xa0International Baccalaureate, a Swiss non-profit with a curriculum it says cprepares students to succeed in a world where facts and fiction merge in the news. Letovo is modeled on the best international institutions in the world, with an expert council staffed by recruits from schools that understand the importance of atmosphere in learning like Winchester College in the U.K., Montgomery Bell in the U.S. and Raffles in Singapore, Moshkovich said. His $80 million campus includes dormitories, tennis courts, a soccer field, a running track, a stream and an artificial lake rimmed by pine forest. The other $120 million is set aside in an endowment, most of which is already deposited in Sberbank and earning interest. Tuition will run about $20,000 a year, half of what a comparable British school charges, but parents who can 9t afford the full amount will be eligible for grants on a sliding scale.

Shchukin said Letovo may be a game-changer not only for his industry but for the Russian system as a whole. Everyone who 9s interested in education is watching very closely because its success may spur more investment, giving parents even more domestic schooling options, he said. Letovo is already taking applications for Sept. 1, when it will welcome 170 students in grades seven to nine. Once fully operational in 2020, Moshkovich said 1,100 students in grades seven\\xa0to 11 will be receiving instruction from 160 of the best educators money can buy, including 60 foreigners.  cI 9ve already fulfilled my ambitions in business, I won 9t be able to spend the money I 9ve earned, the billionaire said. cMy goal now is to provide Russian children with a world-class education.

The analysis says in the North East 35% of white working-class students have entered with only vocational exams. The think tank is calling for more recognition of how exams other than A-levels are used to get into university, particularly by poorer students. And it warns of \"institutional snobbery\" against vocational exams. The research from the Social Market Foundation highlights how vocational qualifications are used for university applications - with about a fifth of places being awarded entirely on the basis of vocational exams.     Vocational exams 'ignored' But this is not evenly spread - with the report highlighting that working- class students from the north of England are particularly likely to have gained places with vocational qualifications. Young people from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications, such as BTecs. Children from poorer families are twice as likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications than the children of professional families. There is also a regional difference, with fewer people in the South applying with vocational qualifications. The think tank says this social divide produces an unhelpful bias in the system - with A-levels dominating political debate about university entry. The report says the emphasis on A-levels means that universities do not always give enough support or recognition for applicants with vocational qualifications. Entry requirements can often be set in A-levels, with the risk of putting off applicants with vocational qualifications. \"For too long, politicians and the media alike have ignored and even belittled the vocational route, because politics and the media are dominated by people who took the traditional route of A-levels then university,\" said James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation. \"Most of the people who run the country didn't do BTecs, and they don't come from the sort of background where BTecs matter most. \"The result is institutional snobbery against vocational qualifications and the people who have them.\" Maddalaine Ansell, chief executive of the University Alliance group of universities, said there had to be support for vocational alternatives to A-levels as a route into higher education - so they did not \"end up being dead-ends\".

Also pupils' progress in digital skills has not kept pace with technology, said Estyn in its annual report. The chief inspector welcomed a shift towards a \"culture of self-improvement\" and more joint working between schools. Half of secondary and 70% of primary schools inspected were judged good or excellent in 2016-17. This is broadly in line with overall results since 2010 with the rest judged adequate or unsatisfactory.    Looking after pupils' wellbeing is one of the strongest features of the education system, while standards and teaching are relatively weaker, according to Estyn. Chief inspector Meilyr Rowlands said \"there is much to be proud of in the Welsh education system\" and there are \"many strengths\" in nurseries, maintained special schools and in further education colleges. \"Variability, however, remains a challenge in most other sectors,\" he said. The education secretary welcomed the report as showing sustained momentum in the education system. Estyn's 2016-17 annual report looks at key policy areas over the past seven years, back to 2010 when the current inspection cycle began.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Literacy and numeracy** Poor results in Pisa international tests(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-25196974) were a key reason for introducing a new emphasis on literacy and numeracy in 2013 as well as a national reading and numeracy test for seven to 14-year-olds.(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38172346) The report says that since then there have been improvements in how schools promote literacy but the standard of pupils' writing is weaker than other aspects. In many primary schools \"pupils struggle to write creatively and do not write at length frequently enough\" and \"too many pupils continue to make basic errors in spelling and punctuation\". Over the seven-year inspection cycle the inspectorate found that in primary schools \"enthusiasm for literature, their knowledge of different authors and stories, and their ability to express preferences about specific books, authors or genres have declined\". Overall the report found that the teaching of numeracy has improved. But the report says: \"In about a third of primary schools and three-fifths of secondary schools, there are shortcomings in the way that schools plan for and ensure that pupils use and develop their numeracy skills across the curriculum.\"   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Developing digital skills** There has been an emphasis on boosting digital and information technology skills in recent years and, along with literacy and numeracy, schools will be expected to emphasise it in all elements of the new curriculum which will be rolled out from 2022. But the report says that opportunities to develop information communication technology (ICT) skills across subjects are \"limited in many secondary schools and a third of primary schools\". In just under two-thirds of primary schools, there are \"important shortcomings in standards of ICT\". Though most pupils are confident using programmes such as word processing and creating presentations, their skills are often limited to \"a narrow range of applications\".   * Are Welsh schools teaching enough digital skills?(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39455837)   * Learning on iPads 'more enjoyable'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37429889)   * Computers 'do not improve pupils' results'(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34174796)    Image copyrightGetty Images  **The Foundation Phase** Since 2011, three to seven-year-olds have been taught through the Foundation Phase(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42271232), which is meant to be a less formal way of learning through activities. But the report says that overall its application has been \"inconsistent\" and though there is generally a strong commitment to the principles \"more recently there has been increasing formality\". It says only about a quarter of schools deliver the Foundation Phase well and about three-quarters of head teachers do not fully understand the principles behind it.     Click to see content: estyn1_jan18(//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/estyn1_jan18)     **Tackling the effects of disadvantage** Another major priority in education policy over the past seven years has been tackling the impact of poverty on pupils' performance at school and, though the chief inspector has found that there is now a stronger focus in schools on this aim, the gap has not narrowed at GCSE(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-41513404). The report also notes \"despite some improvements, the attendance of pupils that are eligible for free school meals continues to be a concern at all phases\". Over the last three years, about 40% of 14 to 16-year-olds eligible for free school meals have less than 90% attendance compared to 16% of other pupils.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Primary schools** Between 2010 and 2017 there were improvements in the performance of boys and pupils eligible for free school meals. But in a third of schools more able pupils \"do not achieve what they are capable of\". Standards of wellbeing have been good or better in seven in 10 schools and attendance has improved in most schools. But the quality of teaching has varied over the past seven years. In 2016-17, 20% of the primary schools inspected were judged as excellent, and six schools (3%) were put in special measures due to failings.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Secondary schools** Half of secondary schools inspected in 2016-17 were good or excellent, a significantly lower proportion than primary schools. The report says that one possible reason why primary school inspection outcomes are better on average than those for secondary schools is the effect that external examinations can have. The proportion of schools with unsatisfactory standards generally increased between 2010 and 2017. Schools have performed well in terms of pupils' wellbeing and one of the greatest improvements has been in attendance, up from 91.4% in 2011 to 94.1% in 2017. Improved teaching is needed in a majority of schools inspected this year and over the past seven years, the report says.     **Welsh language development** When it comes to the Welsh language, in the early school years nearly all Welsh-medium schools and most English-medium schools pupils \"make a good start\" when learning to speak and listen in Welsh. But there are weaknesses in the way many local authorities plan for Welsh language provision and recruiting Welsh medium staff is \"a challenge across many areas of Wales\", says the report.   !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05vvl86.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionOldcastle Primary in Bridgend already collaborates with other schools on numeracy  School-to school collaboration More cooperation between schools is seen as one of the biggest shifts in education over the past seven years and Estyn believes there is enough excellence across Welsh education to support improvement and help reduce variability. The \"spirit of cooperation\" was most obvious in the way that the new curriculum is being developed.    Political and professional reaction David Evans, Wales secretary of the teaching union, National Education Union Cymru (NEU), said: \"This report shows that despite increasingly difficult funding settlements and the ongoing concerns of workload, schools and teachers in Wales are continuing to provide an education service we can be proud of. \" He said it was \"especially good news\" to see Estyn praising schools for working constructively together. Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said the move towards a culture of self-improvement within Welsh education was not enough to raise standards. He said: \"Everyone knows that unless the government urgently address the underlying issues of diminishing education budgets and failures on recruiting and retaining teachers, this new culture is merely a case of building a house on sand.\" Welsh Conservatives education spokesman Darren Millar said the report highlighted many of the same concerns from previous annual reports. \"It's clear that we need to make much more rapid progress to ensure that our children get the high quality education they deserve,\" he said. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"Our national mission for education seeks to raise standards, reduce the attainment gap and deliver an education system that is a source of national pride and enjoys public confidence. \"The report notes our efforts to reduce the attainment gap, but we know there is no room for complacency. \"That's why we're doubling the Pupil Development Grant(http://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/schoolshome/deprivation/pdg- and-early-years-pdg/?lang=en) for our youngest learners, so that every child has the opportunity to reach their potential.\"   ",

More recently, however, we 9ve seen reductions in how often students are tested and in the importance of the results 4 and now there are schools finding success with assessment alternatives. This post details that success and how it can be expanded to other schools and districts. This was written by Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair & Open Testing(http://www.fairtest.org), a nonprofit group\\xa0known as FairTest that works to end the abuse of standardized tests. By Monty Neill The misuse and overuse of standardized testing has greatly damaged education. The harm has been most severe for low-income and minority-group children, often turning their schools into little more than mind-numbing test- preparation programs. The evidence clearly shows it has failed to improve educational outcomes.(http://www.fairtest.org/independent-test-results-show- nclb-fails) The good news is the nation is making slow progress toward leaving the high-stakes testing era behind. This progress is gradually removing major impediments to genuine assessment reform. But what would that look like? Are there good models? The New York Performance Standards Consortium(http://performanceassessment.org/) is an excellent example for high schools that is also relevant to elementary and middle schools. The consortium focuses on inquiry-driven, project-based learning measured by performance-based assessments 4 and its success with the most vulnerable students makes its outcomes particularly impressive. The consortium is made up of 38 traditional public high schools. Thirty-six are in New York City. These follow the same admissions process as other New York City high schools that do not require entrance exams. The student populations largely mirror the city 9s student body, with nearly identical shares of black and low-income youth and students with disabilities, and higher percentages of Latinos and English language learners (ELL). Students enter consortium high schools with slightly lower English Language Arts and math average scores than citywide averages. A new report, cRedefining Assessment: Data Report on the New York Performance Standards Consortium(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhDg- gsYCiLxqpUud0j_hmfNu6qcHwHH), shows that consortium schools significantly outperform other New York City public schools. It found that the consortium 9s dropout rate is significantly lower than that of regular New York City public schools. Four- and six-year graduation rates for all categories of students are higher than for the rest of the city. Graduation rates are roughly 50 percent greater for ELLs and students with disabilities. Eighteen months after high school graduation, the college enrollment rate is 83 percent. That 9s 24 points higher than the city 9s. These rates compare favorably with national data(https://nscresearchcenter.org/snapshotreport-persistenceretention22/) on persistence into the second year of college. The college enrollment rate for cminority males is more than double the national average. **Performance Assessments** Central to the consortium 9s success are its cproven practitioner- developed, student-focused performance assessments. These are created by teachers and rooted in inquiry-based curricula and teaching. Students learn to investigate topics in depth and to explore their own interests within each subject. To cdemonstrate college and career readiness and to qualify for graduation, all consortium schools require students to complete four Performance-Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs). These include an analytic literature essay, a social studies research paper, a student-designed science experiment, and high-level mathematics problems with real-world applications. They have both written and oral components. In the oral component, students respond to questions from a panel of teachers and outside experts, similar to a graduate school thesis defense. For example, in social studies, each student must write and defend a research- based analytic paper on questions that have grown out of a history, government, or economics class. The Data Report explains that cin some cases the tasks are crafted by the teacher and in other instances by the student. The report includes samples of the wide range of interests addressed by the students. Avram Barlowe, who teaches history at consortium member Urban Academy, says PBATs require students to learn perseverance, how to assess and apply evidence, and explain their thinking in written and oral forms. They cdemand that students learn, through practice, how to read, write, calculate, observe and research in a critical manner. A DVD series, cTeacher to Teacher(http://www.teacherscollegepress.com/teachertoteacher.html), shows how teachers and students build their courses to attain these ends. One student said: cBeing educated at a consortium school had a profound effect on my life. Every student is entitled to an educational community as enriching and inspiring as mine was. **School Improvement and Accountability** The consortium has permission from the New York Department of Education to administer only one of the five required state graduation tests, English Language Arts. The PBATs, generally completed in 11th and 12th grades, replace the Regents exams in other subjects and for school accountability. All the PBATs and oral defenses completed for the common graduation requirement are evaluated using consortium-wide scoring guides. (They are in the report.) Written and revised as needed by consortium teachers, they enable consistent evaluations across schools. Samples of student work are blindly re- scored to evaluate both reliability of scoring and the challenge level of teacher assignments. Carefully selected examples help scorers and students think about high-quality work. These scoring guides could be adopted by other schools as well as states. The college persistence data show that the extensive reading, writing and long-term planning required for the performance assessments prepare students well for higher education. Consortium head and FairTest board member Ann Cook argues this evidence is far more valuable than test scores. The consortium 9s success challenges other schools and states to overhaul assessment and put educators back in control of assessment. The results give the lie to the claim that low-income youth need a tightly controlled intellectual and social environment or top-down mandates to succeed. The focus on teacher- and student-led performance assessments enables true instructional cpersonalization(http://www.fairtest.org/personalized-learning-or- continuous-online-testing). The consortium is also collaborating with elementary and middle-school teachers to design new assessments. These enable close observation and documentation of student growth and support inquiry-focused education. The City 9s Education Department has approved the consortium 9s assessment as one of the options for schools to use when assessing preschool children. However, an overhaul in Grades 3-8 runs into federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) mandates. One path forward is for states to take advantage of ESSA 9s Innovative Assessment pilot project. The pilot is based on New Hampshire 9s success in transitioning from standardized tests to teacher- crafted performance tasks. FairTest 9s report, cAssessment Matters(http://www.fairtest.org/assessment-matters-constructing-model-state- system), uses New Hampshire, the consortium, and other strong examples to show how states can build a new system that ends the educational domination of standardized tests. And the consortium shows how implementing performance assessment can have great success where it most matters 3 for the students.  ",

            "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended her agency 9s commitment to minority students in a wide-ranging hearing in which congressional leaders pressed Ms. DeVos on her department 9s budget. , Ms. DeVos testified before the House Appropriations Committee, fielding questions on the Education Department 9s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October. The request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. ,  cWith this budget, we can continue to return power to those who walk side by side with students every day, Ms. DeVos said. cBecause that 9s who budgets are for, not special interest, not legislators, not the system. This budget is about students. , But Democratic lawmakers disagreed that the budget would benefit all students 4 especially minorities. , Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, called the budget a cslap in the face for minority students. Ms. Lee seized on a proposed $1 million cut to the department 9s Office for Civil Rights, and its proposed cuts to after-school programs. , The cuts, coupled with the Trump administration 9s decision to examine and possibly rescind guidance meant to protect minority students from racial discrimination in discipline(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics /school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html) and special education decisions, inflamed a debate about the department 9s approach to minority students. ,  cYour head is in the sand about racial bias and racial discrimination, Ms. Lee said, adding: cYou just don 9t care about civil rights of black and brown children. This is horrible. , Ms. DeVos said that she was cvery proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights, and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination. , She also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools. ,  cI believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education, Ms. DeVos said. , She also defended her agency 9s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school-shootings- obama-discipline-policies.html) of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month. ,  cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps, Ms. DeVos said. cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is. , Ms. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country. , Ms. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association. , Ms. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to cspend taxpayer dollars efficiently. , The directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos 9s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee. , One week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was obtained by The New York Times(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/education-secretary- devos-reorganization-plan-union.html). ,  cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department 9s plans for fiscal year 2019, the email said. cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this. , Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was cabsolutely not true that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present. ,  cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that 4 a deliberative document not in final form, she said. cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization. , While it is not abnormal for education secretaries to reorganize the department, and not many decisions require congressional approval, it is also customary for the department to share details with key committees. , In the email, the staff member leaked a reorganization plan that included a consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Labor Department. , Education Department officials said they had since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most protested part of the proposal. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump 9s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. , Though the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House 9s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico(https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/14/devos- defies-white-house-education-budget-414849). Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. , Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department 9s programs and resources. , Ms. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop. , Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about ca disconnect between Ms. DeVos 9s administration and his office. ,  cIt 9s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don 9t have staff that understand how the system works, Mr. Frelinghuysen said. cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills. , The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts. , For the most part, Ms. DeVos 9s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services. , Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department 9s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department 9s overhaul. , Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of cofficial time, which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. , The union said the agreement came cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table, which concluded with the department 9s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. , The department said that the union cspent more than a year dragging its feet, and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. , The department put its final offer in place.

            "article": "  Libertarian economist Bryan Caplan didn 9t strive for subtlety when he titled his new book _The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_. As I wrote in a  Remarks column(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/the-case-against- college) in the print edition of _Bloomberg Businessweek_ , the George Mason University professor makes a strong case that most of what people learn in high school and college is unnecessary and quickly forgotten. He says that only about a fifth of the value of an education is the increase in human capital. The rest is csignaling 4the degree itself puts you in line ahead of non-graduates, even if you learned nothing useful, because it tells potential employers that you 9re reasonably smart, reasonably determined to complete what you started, and reasonably good at fitting in. Signaling is a zero-sum game: possibly useful for the individual who gets ahead, but wasteful for society. I recommend the book. Still,\\xa0I can 9t fully buy\\xa0Caplan 9s conclusion that the solution is to cut back drastically on taxpayer support for college, and even high school. Caplan\\xa0disagrees with my disagreement. On the\\xa0blog he shares with some other economists, EconLog, he called(http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2018/01/two_comments_on.html) my article cfun and fair but indicated that I had fallen victim to csocial desirability bias by arguing that society should bend over backward not to deprive lower-income strivers of the human capital that college does build. (He also made a fair point\\xa0about my throwaway line concerning Sanskrit and cement mixing, and I agree with him, so set that aside.) Here 9s Caplan: > Human beings like saying 4\\xa0and believing 4\\xa0whatever sounds good, even if what sounds good makes little sense.\\xa0My question for Coy: If deleting 80% of the perceived social rewards of education makes you no more willing to cut public support for public education, what would?\\xa0 What if we deleted 90% of education&apos;s perceived social rewards?\\xa095%\\xa099%?\\xa0I know it sounds nice to say, \"If it helps one person, it&apos;s worth it,\" but that&apos;s crazy.\\xa0No one spends their own money so casually 4\\xa0nor should they.\\xa0Furthermore, you can easily use some of the budgetary savings to help \"strivers\" in more cost-effective ways.\\xa0So why not?     So let me answer that question. I accept Caplan 9s economics-y point that life involves trade-offs. If public support for education helped just one person while costing $1 trillion, it wouldn 9t be worth it. Likewise, if Caplan could prove that wasteful signaling accounts for 99\\xa0percent of the value of\\xa0education. But that 9s not what he says. He says it accounts for 80 percent of the value of education. Some other economists put the ratio considerably lower 4less than half. And reforms could further increase the amount of human capital that the education system creates. In other words, education really does educate, even if it is overly expensive and not very effective. When you yank public funding from education, you are making it difficult or impossible for children who grew up poor or in the lower middle class to get the same access to learning that children of rich families take for granted. As for Caplan 9s idea of using some of the savings to help strivers in more cost-effective ways: Tracking low-income students toward vocational education because it 9s all they can afford feels Dickensian(http://dickens.port.ac.uk/poverty/). Libertarians such as\\xa0Caplan\\xa0stress individual liberty and minimal taxation. Most of us are a bit more communitarian, meaning that we 9re more likely to think of society as a family. A family tries to give every child the very best shot at success, even when it is (overly) expensive to do so. If that 9s what Caplan\\xa0wants to call csocial desirability bias, so be it.   ",

I say it's time we work together to end it. !Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170409101815-equal-pay-women- large-169.jpg)(/2017/04/11/opinions/equal-pay-talk-should-be-for-all-women- jones-opinion/index.html) Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(/2017/04/11/opinions/equal- pay-talk-should-be-for-all-women-jones-opinion/index.html) At the American Association of University Women (AAUW), our 170,000 members(https://www.aauw.org/) and supporters throughout the 50 states and US territories have a goal: Close the pay gap now. And we have a plan(https://www.aauw.org/fairpay/). No single act will do it -- we need to bring the pieces together for change. First, we need strong federal and state pay equity laws. It's been more than 50 years since the Equal Pay Act of 1963(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm), prohibiting workplace wage discrimination on the basis of sex and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm), barring all employment discrimination on the basis of race, religion and national origin, as well as sex. While these laws helped to make advances, they are in need of 21st century updates. In short, times have changed, and laws must too. And many states are now taking action. In 2017, 42 states(https://www.aauw.org/2017/10/13/state- equal-pay-victories-in-2017/) introduced laws to address the wage gap. Their strategies ranged from banning salary histories to ensuring employees have vital access to salary information in order to identify if they are being paid unfairly. Five states and Puerto Rico succeeded in passing their laws. This year, per AAUW's internal monitoring, 38 states have pay equity legislation under consideration, with a new law passing in Washington state just last month. !Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404161412-starbucks-maternity- leave-2-large-169.jpg)(/2017/04/04/opinions/paid-family-leave-for-all- boushey-bethell/index.html) Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(/2017/04/04/opinions/paid- family-leave-for-all-boushey-bethell/index.html) Second, we must change employer practices and break down barriers for women.

In workshops around the country, we have seen that when women negotiate for higher pay, it can result in more income for themselves and their families. While you can't negotiate around discrimination, this effort will help accelerate change for women and the broader movement for equal pay.

(Evan Vucci/AP) More than $1 billion would be spent on private school vouchers and other school choice plans under the budget proposal released Monday by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The proposal also calls for slashing the Education Department 9s budget and devoting more resources to career training, at the expense of four-year colleges and universities. The proposal would cut $3.6 billion\\xa0 4 about 5 percent\\xa0 4 from the Education Department by eliminating\\xa0several discretionary programs, including one that funds after-school activities for needy children and another that covers teacher training. It contains many of the same ideas that DeVos pitched in her budget proposal last year, large portions of which Congress rejected.  cSo many of America 9s poorest children 4 especially African American and Hispanic children 4 attend failing public schools that afford them little hope of fulfilling their great potential, Trump said in his budget summary(https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02 /budget-fy2019.pdf). cThat is why families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school option that is right for them. The budget empowers parents, especially of our disadvantaged youth, to choose the very best school for their children. In a separate item, Trump seeks to ax a $40 million scholarship fund for D.C. residents who attend colleges and universities, a subsidy intended to make up for District residents not being able to get in-state tuition. _ Trump wants to eliminate federal funding for D.C. tuition aid program (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/12/trump-wants- to-eliminate-federal-funding-for-d-c-tuition-aid- program/?utm_term=.4d0571c1b091)_ DeVos originally sought $2.5 billion to support school choice initiatives, including private school vouchers, but the Office of Management and Budget rejected her request, according to people familiar with the proposal.\\xa0She is once again seeking to cut several discretionary programs, including federal funding for the Special Olympics and a grant program for college students with cexceptional financial need.  cThe budget . . . reflects our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently by consolidating and eliminating duplicative and ineffective federal programs that are better handled at the state or local level, said DeVos, who wants to eliminate 29 discretionary programs. cI look forward to working with Congress to pass a budget that puts students first and returns power in education to where it belongs: with states, districts and families. Many\\xa0of DeVos 9s budget priorities for higher education mirror provisions in the House GOP higher education bill, giving the secretary a good chance of seeing her vision in that realm come to fruition. Still, the forthcoming Senate version of legislation could be far less partisan than what Republicans are rushing through the House. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has vowed to work with Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the panel, to craft a bill, although the two are heading in different policy directions. DeVos 9s budget proposal last year sought to\\xa0cut 13.5 percent of the agency 9s funding, and aimed\\xa0to cut college work-study programs in half and end public-service loan forgiveness. Congress scaled back the reductions significantly and refused to approve a number of steps DeVos sought, including the work-study and loan forgiveness efforts and a plan to redirect federal money to expanding private school vouchers. ****The budget also includes other initiatives:  4 Allowing low-income students who receive Pell Grants to use them to enroll in short-term programs, although funding overall would not increase much. As it stands, students cannot use grant money to pay for academic programs that are shorter than 15 weeks or have fewer than\\xa0600 hours of instruction time. Although the budget proposal lacks specifics, the department could model legislation introduced by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). The pair have a bill that would allow students to use Pell grants for programs with a minimum of 150 hours of instruction over a period of at least eight weeks.  4 Folding the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, a form of federal aid for the children of deceased service members, into the Pell program to safeguard it from automatic spending cuts under sequestration, a package of cuts that is part of the 2011 Budget Control Act. Democrats proposed the same move in legislation to overhaul the Pell grant program last year.  4 Taking an ax to\\xa0loan forgiveness for public servants and to subsidized loans\\xa0through which the federal government pays interest while an undergraduate borrower is in school.  4\\xa0Changing\\xa0the allocation formula for the work-study program to provide funding based, in part, on a college 9s enrollment of Pell grant recipients. This resembles a provision in the House GOP proposal to reauthorize the Higher Education Act that sets aside work-study money for schools with the highest graduation rates for Pell grant recipients.  4 Consolidating five income-driven student loan repayment plans into a single plan that benefits\\xa0undergraduate borrowers, who can have the balance of their loan forgiven after paying 10 percent of their income for 20 years. As with his proposed budget last year, Trump wants to make good on a campaign promise to shorten the payment period to 15 years for undergraduates, but raise monthly payments **\\xa0** to 12.5 percent of income for both undergraduates and graduate students. Graduate students, though, would have to pay for longer: 30 years. This time, the administration is proposing to automatically enroll people who are severely behind on their loan payments in an income-driven plan, which could help bring down the default rate.  4 Reorganizing the department, including consolidating the Office of Postsecondary Education and the Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education, a move that underscores the Trump administration 9s focus on transforming postsecondary education into career training.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Convened to examine the causes of civil unrest in black communities, the presidential commission issued a 1968 report with a stark conclusion: America was moving toward two societies, cone black, one white\\xa0 4\\xa0separate and unequal. Fifty years after the historic Kerner Commission identified cwhite racism as the key cause of cpervasive discrimination in employment, education and housing, there has been no progress in how African Americans fare in comparison to whites when it comes to\\xa0homeownership, unemployment and incarceration, according to a report(http://www.epi.org/publication/50-years-after-the-kerner-commission/) released Monday by the Economic Policy Institute. In some cases, African Americans are worse off today than they were before the civil rights movement culminated in laws barring housing and voter discrimination, as well as racial segregation.  * 7.5 percent of African Americans were unemployed in 2017, compared\\xa0with 6.7 percent in 1968\\xa0 4 still roughly twice the white unemployment rate.  * The rate of homeownership, one of the most important ways for working- and middle-class families to build wealth, has remained virtually unchanged for African Americans in the past 50 years. Black homeownership remains just over 40 percent, trailing 30 points behind the rate for whites, who have seen modest gains during that time.  * The share of incarcerated African Americans has nearly tripled between 1968 and 2016\\xa0 4 one of the largest and most depressing developments in the past 50 years, especially for black men, researchers said. African Americans are 6.4 times as likely than whites to be jailed or imprisoned, compared with 5.4 times\\xa0as\\xa0likely in 1968.  cWe have not seen progress because we still have not addressed the issue of racial inequality(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/18 /white-people-are-really-confident-things-are-getting-better-for-black- people/?utm_term=.6fbcb7a5edc9) in this country, said John Schmitt, an economist and vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, citing the\\xa0racial wealth gap(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and- hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind- whites/?utm_term=.d4a39197bea7) and continuing racial discrimination in the labor and housing markets. cOne of the key issues is the disadvantages so many African Americans face, right from the very beginning as children. The wealth gap between white and black Americans has\\xa0more than tripled(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/05/heres-why-the- wealth-gap-is-widening-between-white-families-and-everyone- else/?utm_term=.f52b3d84a726) in the past 50 years, according to Federal Reserve data. The typical black family had zero wealth in 1968. Today the median net worth of white families 4 $171,000 4 is 10 times that of black families. The wealth black families have accumulated is negligible when it comes to the amount of money needed to meet basic needs during retirement, pay for children 9s college education, put a down payment on a house, or cope with a job loss or medical crisis, Schmitt said. _ Bolster black banks 4 and in the process, uplift a community that has been systematically marginalized for generations (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/move-your-money-move- society/2017/03/31/68cb95c8-036d-11e7-b9fa- ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.ee09717635b2)_ The lack of economic progress is especially startling, given that black educational attainment has improved significantly in the past five decades, Schmitt said. African Americans are almost as likely as whites to have completed high school. In 1968, 54 percent of blacks graduated from high school, compared\\xa0with 75 percent of whites. Today, more than 90 percent of African Americans have a high school diploma, 3.3 percentage points shy of the high school completion rate for whites. The share of young African Americans with a college degree has more than doubled, to 23 percent, since 1968, although blacks are still half as likely as whites to have completed college. Yet the hourly wage of a typical black worker grew by just 0.6 percent a year since 1968. African Americans make 82.5 cents of every dollar earned by the typical white worker, the report said. And the typical black household earns 61.6 percent of the annual income of white households, with black college graduates continuing to make less than white college graduates. Despite the poverty rate dropping from more than a third of black households in 1968 to about a fifth of black households, African Americans are 2\\xbd times\\xa0as\\xa0likely to be in poverty than whites.  cWe would have expected to see much more of a narrowing of the gap, given the big increase in educational attainment among African Americans, Schmitt said. A book, cHealing Our Divided Society, to be released Tuesday at a D.C. forum, also examines how little progress has been made in the past 50 years. Housing and schools have become resegregated, clocking too many African Americans into slums and their children into inferior schools. White supremacists have become emboldened. And there is too much excessive use of force\\xa0 4 often deadly\\xa0 4 by police, especially against African Americans, notes the book, co-edited by Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator and sole surviving member of the Kerner Commission.  cWhereas the Kerner Commission called for 8massive and sustained 9 investment in economic, employment and education initiatives, over the last 50 years America has pursued 8massive and sustained 9 incarceration framed as 8law and order, 9 the book says. cMass incarceration has become a kind of housing policy for the poor. The 1968 Kerner Commission report ended on a note of deja vu, citing a witness who recalled similar analyses, recommendations and, ultimately, inaction following a government investigation nearly 50 years earlier after the 1919 Chicago riot.  cThe destruction and the bitterness of racial disorder, the harsh polemics of black revolt and white repression have been seen and heard before in this country, the report concluded.

The E.E.O.C. reported(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/retaliation_considerations.cfm) that 48.8 percent of the complaints filed by workers in 2017 contained an allegation of retaliation. , Toward the end of the evening, entrees were forgotten and talk turned to the current moment and the future. cI believe we 9re at a tipping point, Ms. Bickford said. cThe computer has really helped us disseminate information, and I think men are on notice now. Ms. Bickford and her colleagues in the business world have formed the Paradigm for Parity(https://www.paradigm4parity.com/), which provides a five-step plan for gender equality that they have persuaded dozens of corporate leaders to implement. , Ms. Robbins was recently one of the speakers at the Women 9s March in Philadelphia and is working to help elect more female leaders. And Ms. Johnson plans to stick around in city administration and in the union as long as she can. cWe have to look out for the ones who follow behind us, Ms. Johnson said. cThere are more battles to be fought. Everyone deserves a chance.  ",

(AFP/Getty Images) President Trump spoke for(http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou_minutes.php) one hour, 20 minutes and 31 seconds (including applause) to deliver his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, and spoke directly about education policy very briefly 4 for one sentence, or two if you want to be charitable. And he didn 9t mention school choice, which is surprising, given that he has said it is his chief educational priority. This is what Trump said in regard to education policy: > As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. There was nothing about school choice, graduation rates, student loans, standardized test scores, curriculum standards. And as Post reporter Moriah Balingit noted here,(https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live- updates/trump-white-house/fact-checking-and-analysis-of-trumps-state-of-the- union-2018-address/will-schools-be-included-in-trumps-infrastructure- plan/?utm_term=.75f93fcc3aee) he didn 9t include schools when he talked about rebuilding America 9s infrastructure, saying: cWe will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across our land. The focus on vocational schools is in line with his administration 9s views of the purpose of education: to create skilled workers for America 9s work force, which is rather limited in scope, as Arthur W. Foshay wrote in cThe Curriculum Matrix: Transcendence and Mathematics(http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_update/eu201207_infographic.pdf), in the Journal of Curriculum and Supervision in 1991: > cThe one continuing purpose of education, since ancient times, has been to bring people to as full a realization as possible of what it is to be a human being. Other statements of educational purpose have also been widely accepted: to develop the intellect, to serve social needs, to contribute to the economy, to create an effective work force, to prepare students for a job or career, to promote a particular social or political system. These purposes offered are undesirably limited in scope, and in some instances they conflict with the broad purpose I have indicated; they imply a distorted human existence. The broader humanistic purpose includes all of them, and goes beyond them, for it seeks to encompass all the dimensions of human experience. Or what Martin Luther King Jr., said about the purpose of education: > cThe function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character 4 that is the goal of true education. Trump gave anyone commenting on the education portion of his speech very little to work with, as seen in Education Secretary Betsy DeVos 9s statement about the address: > cAmerica must do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st century economy. I join the president in calling on Congress to act in the best interest of students and expand access to more education pathways. It is worth noting that despite his call for more vocational education, his first education budget proposal sought to slash $168 million in grants(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/06/06/all-but- impossible-republican-senator-says-trumps-education-proposal-is- doa/?utm_term=.bb2b4480afab)\\xa0that fund career and technical education programs in high schools. Why? He wanted to use the money to expand school choice. The proposal wasn 9t popular with Democrats or Republicans, and most of the proposed grant cuts were not supported by Congress. These were the only mentions of cschool or ceducation in his 2018 State of the Union Speech, besides the vocational schools remark: > The first pillar of our immigration framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age 4 that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet **education** and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. And: > One of Staub 9s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through **high school** , lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax 1cut raise into his new home and his two daughters 9 **education**. Please join me in congratulating Corey. And: > Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters 4 Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens 4 were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa 9s 16th birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa 9s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors 4 and wound up in Kayla and Nisa 9s **high school**. And he briefly mentioned college savings accounts, with cbriefly being the operative word: > Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8\\xa0trillion in value. That is great news for Americans 9 401k, retirement, pension, and **college savings accounts**.  ",

            "article": " The Education Department confirmed Monday it is no longer investigating civil rights complaints from transgender students barred from school bathrooms that match their gender identity, a development those students say leaves them vulnerable to bullying and violence. The Obama administration in 2016 directed public schools to allow students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity, even if that conflicted with the gender on their birth certificates. The administration concluded that barring transgender students from public school bathrooms was a form of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX. But shortly after President Trump took office last year, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the guidance, a move that was widely decried by civil rights groups who\\xa0said it could endanger the welfare of transgender students. DeVos said states and individual school districts should be able to determine how to accommodate transgender students. They argued that Title IX did not obligate schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. _ Trump administration rolls back protections for transgender students (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls- back-protections-for-transgender- students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.0b9d4e6180a8)_ Transgender students say using the bathroom that feels right for them is essential for their safety and well-being and poses no threat to others. Some other students and their families see it as an affront to privacy and traditional values. It is a battle that has been waged at school board meetings, in state legislatures and in the courts. A transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, took his fight to use the boys 9 bathroom to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016. The high court declined to hear the case after DeVos reversed course on transgender students rights. _ Transgender teen 9s road to the Supreme Court detours, but his story is not over (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/transgender- teens-road-to-the-supreme-court-detours-but-his-story-is-not- over/2017/03/07/b8c1d010-02a0-11e7-b9fa- ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.7aaebafe5d25)_ In the aftermath of the move, it remained unclear how the department would handle civil rights complaints from transgender students who were barred access to public school bathrooms. In June, Candice Jackson, the acting head of the Office for Civil Rights, told staff that it should evaluate civil rights complaints from transgender students on a case-by-case basis but did not say outright that bathroom complaints should be dismissed. That same month, the department dismissed a long-running civil rights complaint from a transgender girl in Ohio who had been barred from the girls 9 bathroom at school. _ Trump administration 9s approach to handling transgender students 9 civil rights complaints is described in memo (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/06/16/education- department-memo-lays-out-trump-administrations-approach-to-handling- transgender-students-civil-rights-complaints/?utm_term=.309ecd8f8811)_ Transgender students held out hope that the department would continue to back them when they raised issues about bathroom access, even though the guidance was no longer in place. Advocates maintain that Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, requires schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. Some federal appeals courts have backed this view. But the department interprets the law differently. It confirmed Monday that it will not investigate civil rights complaints from transgender students regarding bathroom access, though it will continue to scrutinize other forms of discrimination. The development was first reported by BuzzFeed(https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/edu-dept-trans-student- bathrooms?utm_term=.afY251de6.ctYNZRj6r).  cTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity, Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said in response to questions from The Washington Post. cWhere students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. In the case of bathrooms, however, longstanding regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Pressed on whether the department would investigate such complaints, Hill said: cWhere the Office for Civil Rights does not have jurisdiction based on current law the Office for Civil Rights does not investigate. That aligns with the view held by some conservative legal groups, which have sued on behalf of students made uncomfortable by sharing restrooms with their transgender classmates, saying it violates student privacy. But Catherine Lhamon, who headed the Education Department 9s Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama,\\xa0called the department 9s statement cappalling and deeply dangerous.  cThe federal courts have multiple times made clear that Title IX protects transgender students, Lhamon said. cThey just don 9t have the option to say, 8We just don 9t apply the law here. 9  DeVos has emphasized that her department would not tolerate bullying or harassment of transgender students, and Jackson 9s memo made clear that the department would still investigate other kinds of discrimination against transgender students.  cPlease note that the withdrawal of these guidance documents does not leave students without protections from discrimination, bullying or harassment, DeVos wrote last year after she rescinded the Obama-era protections from transgender students. cAll schools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment. Still, advocates worry that the administration 9s position will send a message to schools without clear policies that they should bar transgender students from bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. cThe vast number of schools in our country are schools led by teachers and principals and administrators who want to do the best for children but this will just be confusing, said Vanessa Ford, the mother of a transgender girl in the first grade who attends school in the Boston area. cThey hear this and think, 8Wait, am I no longer allowed to support trans kids at our school? 9   ",

Perhaps the most important part_. , Wait a minute. Failure, being extolled, even celebrated? In a high school? , Yes, in part because this is not a typical school. The center at suburban Mayfield City Schools, a district of 4,300 K-12 students 15 miles east of Cleveland, is a striking example of an approach to education that could eventually make traditional methods as outdated as chalk and blackboards. , Mayfield 9s model is described as project-based, team-centered, career and industry-aligned learning. , Project Lead the Way(https://www.pltw.org/our-programs?&gclid =EAIaIQobChMIrNjWwvLk2QIVA- EbCh0J6gftEAAYASAAEgL40_D_BwE&utm_campaign=Null_PLTW_General_Brand&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google), an Indianapolis-based nonprofit that is one of the prime progenitors of this educational philosophy, articulates it in its mission statement: ,  cWe believe all students 4 beginning at a young age 4 need access to real-world, applied learning experiences that empower them to gain the skills they need to thrive in college, career and beyond. , At programs like Mayfield 9s 4 where 11 teachers have completed Project Lead the Way 9s certification since 2014 4 that means not only access to state-of-the-art technology, but also partnerships with local organizations to provide those experiences. These include the Cleveland Clinic, which collaborated with the high school this semester in a six-week project in cardiopulmonary education. , Eighty-seven students in grades 9 through 12 were assigned cases that required learning about the anatomy of the heart, as well as advanced medical technologies addressing heart disease. Working in teams of five or six, the students used materials like balsa wood and foam board to create three- dimensional models showing specific problems in the heart, and they became immersed in sophisticated virtual reality simulations that allowed them to see a stent being inserted into an occluded artery. , During the process they were mentored not only by their own teachers, but also by staff members from the hospital. Maria Held(https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/7274-maria-held), a clinical nurse specialist, was dazzled by the Innovation Center, a $3 million facility that opened in 2015 and was largely paid for by a bond issue. ,  cIt 9s almost futuristic, Ms. Held said. cEspecially compared to when I was in school. , Keith Kelly, superintendent of the Mayfield City School District, said the center was cabout getting kids involved in inquiry, in solving problems, in partnerships, in authentic projects that may be of interest to them. , And it is not just the schools that are driving this. The project-centered approach to education involves industry and colleges as well. Here are some other examples. , The Pasadena, Calif., Unified School District 4 a district in which 65 percent of the students qualify for free and reduced-price lunches 4 has nine career-themed cacademies for its high school students. These are learning environments that closely simulate various industries and professional settings, and include an app development lab, a credit union, a digital film studio and even a courtroom. , All are supervised by teachers working with advisory boards and mentors from local industry, including such organizations as McDonnell Douglas, Caltech, Kaiser Permanente and Saatchi. , Superintendent Brian McDonald calls it a clinked learning approach 4 linking core academic content with a strong set of career technical education course and work-based learning opportunities. cI really think this is the future of education, he said. , Toyota has a number of initiatives aimed at funneling students into careers with the automaker, via partnerships with 256 high schools, summer internships for high school students, specialized degree tracks, and part-time employment at the college level and eventually, for those who finish the pathway, jobs. , The company 9s $10.3 million commitment is intended to address what the program developer, Dennis Dio Parker, calls cthe crisis level shortage of advanced manufacturing technicians facing his industry. ,  cThis is self-motivated change, said Mr. Parker, who is based at the automaker 9s Georgetown, Ky., production support center. cInstead of complaining and griping and pontificating about the educational system, we realized that we had to do something about it. , Toyota, some say, is a model for other industries. cThey send a clear signal to all employers that schools can 9t do this alone, said Vince Bertram, president and chief executive of Project Lead the Way. cIf we 9re going to solve the skills gap, we have to work together. , While many of these innovative programs are STEM-oriented, one partnership between higher and secondary education in Massachusetts seeks to address a different problem: a shortage of nonwhite teachers in the classroom. ,  cAs the number of students continues to diversify in terms of race, language and ethnicity, the teachers are still about 90 to 92 percent white, said Claudia Rinaldi, the director of the education department at Lasell College in Newton, Mass. (Nationwide, the number is about 85 percent.) , Lasell 9s cPathways to Teacher Diversity 4 part of a statewide effort supported by a Gates Foundation grant 4 is a partnership with four school districts in the state intended to encourage more high school students of color to pursue careers in education. cResearch suggests that when these students have a teacher of color, they do better, Ms. Rinaldi said. , An orientation meeting for the Pathways program a year ago attracted 160 students from the four districts. The first group of 12 is getting college credit for an introductory teaching course; an additional 26 are being mentored by Ms. Rinaldi 9s Lasell students. , The long-term goal, she said, is to get these students to return, as certified teachers, to K-12 schools like the ones they attended. cThe districts are hungry to diversify their teaching force. , In 1972, City-as-School High School was established by New York City 9s Board of Education, as a cschool without walls. According to a Bank Street College of Education paper(https://www.bankstreet.edu/scholarly- initiatives/occasional-paper-series/35/part-i/city-as-school/) on the alternative school 9s history, prospective students were invited to csee the city as your curriculum and to cimagine yourself in various and glamorous-sounding professional settings. , Today, most of the 600 students who attend City-as-School spend about two days per week in traditional classes at its Greenwich Village campus. The other three days, they are involved in internships with one of about 300 organizations 4 from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Marvel Comics. There, the students are supervised by employees of the organization (who themselves go through special training), and also by City-as-School teachers who help their students work through the new and daily challenges of work life. ,  cWe have a very real world context for what they 9re learning, said the principal, Alan Cheng. , And that was what the founders of City-as-School hoped to foster. The practicality and applicability of education are still the goal, as innovative school programs and their partners seek to reimagine the educational system in the 21st century. Or as another sign at the Mayfield Innovation Center reads (this one just outside the drafting and design lab, and attributed to Thomas Edison): , _There is a way to do it better. Find it_.  ",

The analysis, issued Wednesday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, said students with disabilities and all boys also experienced disproportionate levels of discipline. But black students were particularly overrepresented: While they constituted 15.5 percent of public school students, they accounted for 39 percent of students suspended from school. The disparity was worse for children of color in prekindergarten: Black students accounted for 19 percent of preschool students in public schools, but represented 47\\xa0 percent of students suspended from preschool. Boys of all groups accounted for 54 percent of the public school pre-K population, but 78 percent of those suspended. Addressing why disparities in discipline exist, the GAO said research points to bias:\\xa0 cImplicit bias 4 stereotypes or unconscious association about people 4 on the part of teachers and staff may cause them to judge students 9 behaviors differently based on the students 9 race and sex. The report was issued on the same day that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos held two forums to hear from people on both sides of the discipline issue, which has been controversial for years. The forums were closed to the press. It has long been agreed that discipline disparities exist based on race and disability, but there is no consensus on what to do about it. The GAO report noted that research has shown that children suspended from school lose important instructional time, are less likely to graduate on time, and are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school and become involved in the juvenile justice system. A study of California youth estimated that students who dropped out of high school because of suspensions would result in about $2.7 billion in costs for the state, stemming from lost wages and tax revenue, increased crime, and higher welfare and health costs. In 2014, President Barack Obama issued guidance to schools in an attempt to end the disparities and to adopt milder disciplinary measures. DeVos has been considering whether to roll back that guidance, and heard from supporters and critics of the measure at the forums. At the first session, DeVos heard from supporters of the Obama-era guidance; the second session was devoted to those who oppose it. Supporters say the Obama guidance is aimed at stemming the school-to-prison pipeline and allowing teachers and students to find ways to handle disciplinary problems that do not ostracize children or cause them to miss considerable classroom time. Critics say it has led to classrooms that are less safe because troubled students act out in the absence of robust discipline. The data analyzed by the GAO found stark disparities for 2013-2014, the latest available information. It found:  * Boys as a group were overrepresented. They account for just over half of public school students. But they represented at least two-thirds of the students disciplined across each of six actions: out-of-school suspensions, in-school suspensions, referrals to law enforcement,\\xa0 expulsions, corporal punishment and school-related arrests.  * A similar pattern was seen for students with disabilities compared to their peers without disabilities. Students with disabilities represented about 12 percent of public school students, but accounted for nearly 25 percent or more of students referred to law enforcement, arrested for a school-related incident or suspended from school.  * Black students with disabilities and boys with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined across all six actions. The GAO wrote the report after analyzing discipline data from nearly all public schools for the 2013-2014 school year from the Education Department 9s Civil Rights Data Collection. The study authors also interviewed federal and state officials, and officials from five school districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota and Texas. Those locations were selected based on disparities in suspensions for black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. Some school districts reported to the GAO that they had realized the importance of finding alternatives to discipline that cunnecessarily removes children from the learning environment. The report said: > Officials in all selected school districts reported they are implementing efforts to better address student behavior or reduce the use of exclusionary discipline. For example, officials in all school districts said that they are implementing alternative discipline models that emphasize preventing challenging student behavior and focus on supporting individuals and the school community, such as positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS), restorative justice practices, and social emotional learning (SEL). For example, officials at a selected school district in Texas said they have implemented a classroom management model that uses positive behavior techniques. To address racial bias, the report said, one school district in California said it had created a leadership team for equity, culture and support services, and developed a district-wide equity plan that includes mandatory training on implicit bias for principals. > Officials from that district also said they had recently changed a policy to increase the consistency of discipline actions across the district 9s schools. Similarly, officials at a school district in Massachusetts reported they were working to build awareness among school leadership to address racial bias and the achievement gap through multiyear trainings. Officials we spoke with at a school within that district said they conduct trainings for staff on implicit bias and other related issues to reduce school discipline disparities. As some of the schools and districts we visited have begun implementing alternative discipline models and efforts to reduce the use of exclusionary discipline in recent years, we heard from officials in two districts that there has been difficulty with implementation due to limited resources, staffing turnover, and resistance on the part of some parents.

            "article": " WASHINGTON 4 Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress 9s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration 9s efforts to re- examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. , The report(https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-258), issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. , Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported 4 including by black students in affluent schools. , Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration 9s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. , The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. , On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year 4 and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. , Nina Leuzzi, a prekindergarten teacher at a Boston charter school, said she kept her word to her class of 20, predominantly minority 4-year-olds, in making her case to the secretary for why the guidance should stay. When the children asked her why she was traveling to Washington, she told them it was to keep them safe. ,  cRescinding this would send the message that there is no longer a concern about discrimination in our schools, Ms. Leuzzi said. , Nicole Stewart, a former vice principal in San Diego, told Ms. DeVos that pressures to reduce suspensions had made schools dangerous. She said administrators did not expel a student with a knife at her school because he had a disability. Weeks later, he slit a student 9s throat, she said. ,  cIt is no wonder that our kids don 9t think that rules and consequences apply to them, Ms. Stewart said. cWe are not modeling what consequences look like in the real world. , Ms. DeVos is facing new pressures after Republicans linked the guidance(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-school- shootings-obama-discipline-policies.html) to the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and President Trump assigned her to lead a school safety commission that will consider whether to repeal the guidance. , Ms. DeVos has declined to say publicly whether she believes that racial bias plays a role in the disproportionate rates at which black students are punished in school. But according to attendees at Wednesday 9s meeting, the secretary opened her remarks by acknowledging that the conversations were taking place on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 9s assassination, and that racial disparities in discipline were a problem in the country. , Evan Stone, co-founder of Educators for Excellence, which represents nearly 30,000 educators across the country, said the acknowledgment gave him hope. cStill, we have a real uphill battle ahead, said Mr. Stone, who attended the meeting with Ms. Leuzzi and five other teachers who are part of the group. , Members of Congress urged Ms. DeVos not to make a decision on the guidance until the G.A.O. report was made public. The Education Department did not issue a response to the G.A.O. findings, as is customary, and did not respond to a request for comment on the report. , The Obama administration guidance was issued based on data that showed that, in 2012, black students were being suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. According to the G.A.O. analysis, in the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school. , The agency also found the disparities for black students started in preschool, and persisted regardless of the type of school they attended 4 disparities were particularly acute in charter schools 4 or the disciplinary action they received. , And black students were the only race in which both boys and girls were disproportionately disciplined across six disciplinary actions examined, which included corporal punishment, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and school-related arrests. , Moreover, the agency found that black students were suspended more often than their white peers in schools of all poverty levels. In the most affluent schools, 7.5 percent of black boys had been given out-of-school suspensions, while 1.8 percent of white boys had. , The finding marks the first time that national discipline rates have been analyzed by poverty level, and challenges a common claim that poverty, more than race, may be driving disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions. , Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles 9s Civil Rights Project, called the finding cgroundbreaking. He said it affirms other research(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class- white-and-black-men.html) that shows that even black boys raised in rich neighborhoods were likely to earn less than their white peers. ,  cThis further shows that poverty is not explaining the disparities, Mr. Losen said. cThere 9s a racial discrimination problem, and that can no longer be disputed. , The G.A.O. analysis was requested by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. , The agency was charged with identifying patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, the challenges that school districts faced with discipline reform, and how the Departments of Education and Justice have addressed the issue through enforcement measures. The investigation took place from November 2016 through March, and included data analysis and interviews with officials in the Education and Justice Departments, as well as district leaders in five states. , The report was praised by Democratic lawmakers as evidence that the 2014 guidance had value. The guidance informed schools that wide racial disparities could signal discriminatory practices that could result in a federal investigation and loss of federal funding. It also suggested a number of strategies for managing nonviolent behavior without resorting to kicking students out of school. ,  cThe G.A.O. 9s first-of-its-kind analysis confirms that racial bias contributes to pervasive discipline disparities, Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler said in a joint statement. cThe G.A.O. 9s findings underscore the need to strengthen the guidance, not rescind it as some have recommended. , But critics who want to see the Obama-era guidance rescinded said the report 9s scope was too narrow to draw broad conclusions. ,  cNone of these findings change the basic story line, said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research organization. cWhat we 9ve learned is discipline reform is being applied unevenly. If you are concerned there are some specific districts and schools that are responding particularly poorly to this, I don 9t think this study gets at that question. , Mr. Petrilli also said the report did not answer the question at the heart of the Obama-guidance criticism: whether racial bias accounted for all the disparities. , The G.A.O. examination illustrated how racial bias was unfolding in some districts. , For instance, at a school district in Kentucky where black students were 10 times as likely as white students to be disciplined, school officials acknowledged that 61 types of violations were undefined, which allowed staff to punish black students more harshly. , In interviews, district officials also reported that they maintained broad discretion in how they disciplined students, and that more serious offenses, like those concerning weapons, violence and drugs, still resulted in removing students from school. , And all of the school districts reported that while they embraced the opportunity to revise their approach to discipline, their biggest barrier was not student behavior. It was the lack of resources to tackle cases of trauma and mental health issues that increasingly plague the nation 9s children.  ",

Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed 2,387 schools would receive money from the \\xa3750m Pupil Equity Funding scheme in 2018-19. Schools in Glasgow will benefit from more than a sixth of the cash. They will receive a total of almost \\xa322m to help fund improvements at 191 schools. The amount of money each school will get is linked to the number of pupils it has receiving free school meals, with the money going directly to head teachers, allowing them to choose how to use the resources.    Mr Swinney announced the allocations to areas and schools ahead of the visit to St Francis RC Primary School in Dundee, where staff used part of the cash they received in 2017-18 to set up six week-long summer schools focused on boosting literacy, numeracy and wellbeing for pupils in the most deprived areas.  'Significant impact' He said: \"Every child should have the best possible start in life, no matter their background. Schools have a significant role to play in ensuring every child is given the right support to help them achieve their full potential. \"Our priority is to close the poverty-related attainment gap. This \\xa3120m of Pupil Equity Funding is aimed at doing just that. \"The funding is targeted towards schools who have the highest numbers of pupils receiving free school meals, so that the money is spent on the children who need it most.\"   He added: \"Last year's allocation is already making a big impact. I have visited a number of schools up and down the country where this funding has empowered teachers to put in place creative new initiatives that are tackling the attainment gap in their schools right now.\" Neil Lowden, head teacher of St Francis RC Primary School, said the cash from the scheme \"has had a significant impact on how I have managed my school in terms of the absolute focus on raising attainment in literacy and numeracy as well as improving outcomes in health and wellbeing for the children in St Francis\". He added: \"As a head teacher, the Pupil Equity Funding has fundamentally allowed our school community to make a real and significant difference to the lives of the children who come through our doors every day.\"  Temporary posts Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), said: \"The identification of funds to those pupils who need support is always helpful but unfortunately, it is replacing other support that has been lost during a continuous programme of education cuts. \"Schools always want to make a difference to those most disadvantaged with additional teachers to assist access to the curriculum and increase inclusion to activities that most other children take for granted. \"The major worry is the sustainability of the funding and the major investment in permanent highly-qualified professionals. \"The current arrangement has seen a large number of temporary posts being created that are not in the interest of the children who need regular and committed professionals to support them through their education journey.\" He added: \"PEP funding is a start but it cannot close, with the present limited funding, the gap to give the most deprived the same education experience as the most advantaged.\" The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said it had concerns about using free school meal claims as the basis for the allocation of funds. Executive director Eileen Prior said: \"We know there is some good work being done with the additional PEF funds but we are keen to see some hard evidence of impact on achievement and attainment.\"   ",

We have been putting educators in front of cameras and shooting video 4 just as the first TV shows did with radio stars, microphone in hand. This is not to say the millions of hours of online content are not valuable; the limits lie in the ability of the underlying technology to customize the material to the individual and to coach. That is about to change, though, through the use of virtual reality, artificial intelligence and sensors. Let me illustrate this with an imaginary school of the future in which Clifford is an artificial intelligence, a digital tutor, and Rachael is the human educational coach. Clifford has been with the children for years and understands their strengths and weaknesses. He customizes each class for them. To a child who likes reading books, he teaches mathematics and science in a traditional way, on their tablets. If they struggle with this because they are more visual learners, he asks them to put on their virtual-reality headsets for an excursion, say, to ancient Egypt. Watching the design and construction of the pyramids, children learn the geometry of different types of triangles and the mathematics behind these massive timeless monuments. They also gain an understanding of Egyptian history and culture by following the minds of the geniuses who planned and constructed them. Clifford also teaches art, music and biology through holographic simulations. By using advanced sensors to observe the children 9s pupillary size, their eye movements and subtle changes in the tone of their voice, Clifford registers their emotional state and level of understanding of the subject matter. There is no time pressure to complete a lesson, and there are no grades or exams. Yet Clifford can tell the parents how the child is doing whenever they want to know and can advise the human, Rachael, on what to teach. Rachael does not lecture or scrawl facts or equations on a blackboard. She is there to listen and help. She asks questions to help develop the children 9s values and thinking and teaches them how to work with one other. She has the responsibility of ensuring that students learn what they need to, and she guides them in ways Clifford cannot. She also helps with the physical side of projects, things made out of real materials rather than in mind and machine. With Clifford as teacher and Rachel as coach, children do not even realize that what they are undertaking is study. It feels like building cool stuff, playing video games and living through history. Clifford, being software and having come into being in the same way that the free applications on our smartphones have, comes without financial charge. Rachael 9s coaching is part of our public education package, funded in the same way today 9s teachers are. We already have wonderful teachers who are supportive and can teach teamwork and values. Believe it or not, we have the ability to build Clifford today. The artificial intelligence tools and sensors to observe human emotion are commonly available via smartphones and digital assistants, and the virtual- reality headsets will soon be powerful enough and affordable enough for holographic learning. Take Facebook 9s Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. When Facebook released Oculus Rift in March 2016, it cost $599 and required a $199 controller and a $1,000 gaming PC. The headset and controller now cost $399 together and do the work of the gaming PC.\\xa0Facebook says(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__newsroom.fb .com_news_2017_10_oculus-2Dannounces-2Dnew-2Dstandalone-2Dheadset-2Dvenues- 2Dat-2Doculus- 2Dconnect_&d=DwMFAg&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r =FozfRwBUYhObqbKa- g0kKh33gdKARdRC8VIU_2g52uI&m=EilB8AlectwQNNSAtIndA21-hBowlPJpBDtb4kx2uCw&s=RiYHpfxaQnHBt41Is3ImZZ7WYf3UEc8n4dbccMagoBY&e=)\\xa0a new version, Oculus Go, will ship later this year and cost $199.

Caplan is right about kids spending time on subjects seemingly irrelevant to the modern labor market, but he 9s wrong about it being a problem. What 9s wrong with most schooling today isn 9t its failure to meet the demands of the job market, but its failure to meet deep personal and societal needs. Of those needs, none is more important than improving the ability of the young to think for themselves, for the obvious reason that today 9s solutions won 9t solve tomorrow 9s problems. The accelerating rate of environmental, demographic and technological change is creating planet- wrecking stresses and generating problems that existing knowledge can 9t solve. Long-term survival is possible only if each generation is smarter than the one that preceded it. Education policies and procedures put in place beginning with the 2002 No Child Left Behind law haven 9t simply failed. They, along with the Common Core State Standards and high-stakes standardized tests, have tightened the screws on a curricular platform that 9s headed toward a cliff. Respected thinkers have long waved warning flags(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http- 3A__www.marionbrady.com_documents_QuotesFragmentation.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=4J0_QAeibnm3jIcl0xkCnJnzSloHIHdgphkccWm1tPs&m=SQ6_ZLf5EdrD4F1sUYmzVamEJiADsINMgNSvyTFUcIQ&s=W67gIVnnxofvUJzeclUHLyxZPG5qBji_qFkfmo0u2ZI&e=). The general education curriculum 4 traditional schooling 9s attempt to prepare the young for life 4 is at odds with the nature of knowledge. Nearly all of my 70 contributions to The Answer Sheet over nearly 10 years have been attempts to show that the subjects in the core curriculum are working parts of a holistic structure of knowledge, that adolescents of every ability level can construct useful versions of that whole, and in so doing better equip themselves for whatever the future may bring. What follows is a summary and links to free, illustrative instructional materials assembled from projects my brother, educator Howard Brady, and I undertook for three publishers who saw potential in ideas I had advanced in academic journals beginning with a 1966 article(http://www.marionbrady.com/articles/1966-NewSocStudies-KappanOct.pdf) in the Phi Delta Kappan. (1) We agree with many others that poverty is a major contributor to the achievement gap, but blame generation after generation of basically flat academic performance on the disconnect between experienced professional educators and state and federal education policymakers. (2) We believe poor academic performance is primarily a consequence of information overload. The traditional core curriculum dumps poorly organized, often useless information on learners in unreasonable volumes at unreasonable rates. (3) We believe standardized tests, and the simplistic assumptions about learning which they reflect, perpetuate merely the _appearance_ of learning. Learners ccram 4 store enough information into short-term memory to recite and pass quizzes and examinations. But when those threats no longer loom, most of what was ctaught and learned at great cost in money and time quickly disappears. In no other institution would such inefficiency be tolerated. (4) We believe an effective general education curriculum must have an agreed- upon aim, and that cmaximize learner ability to make sense of perceived experience is that aim. It puts schooling 9s emphasis where it belongs; respects the myriad implications attending personhood; is essential to the success of all legitimate aims of general education, and the inherent complexity of reality and of how the human brain perceives and processes information shuts down simplistic, attention-diverting creforms. (5) The arguments of defenders of direct instruction and teaching scripts notwithstanding, we believe useful levels of understanding of big ideas can 9t be delivered by text, teacher talk or technology. Firsthand experience isn 9t just the _best_ teacher of complex ideas, it 9s the _only_ teacher. Meaningful learning is assembled firsthand and gradually from sequenced experiences, a process labeled variously as active, discovery, inquiry or constructivist learning. (6) Big idea: Knowledge is created by organized human groups 4 civilizations, societies, ethnicities and so on, from which it follows that organized human groups are the phenomenon most needing to be studied and understood. (7) Big idea: From shared experience, groups 9 cognitive systems emerge 4 distinctive structures of knowledge or cworldviews. d\\xa0 Assumptions about the nature of reality, self, others, the supernatural, time, cthe good life, causation and a few other matters shape everything important that groups think and do 4\\xa0 their arts, sciences, institutions, religions, norms, values 4 everything. (8) Big idea: Nothing a group can know is more useful than an understanding of itself, but the cfish would be the last to discover water phenomenon makes acquiring that understanding difficult, and the information, when called to attention, seems too obvious and mundane to teach. (9) Big idea: Understanding other groups 9 worldviews is even more difficult. Most of the content of world histories has been generated by differences in worldviews, as has any randomly chosen day 9s news. Earth and its people suffer catastrophic consequences from ignorance of self and others. (10) Big idea: Human groups are _systems_ 4 integrated wholes 4 and must be studied as such. Academic disciplines and school subjects focus attention on myriad _parts_ of those wholes 4 their environments, populations, patterns of action, and so on 4 but failing to treat those as studies of system components blocks the basic knowledge-relating process by means of which knowledge expands. (11) Big idea: Studying these big ideas is best begun by using close-at-hand reality as the main learning resource. Each school, its contents and its immediate environs is a functioning, systemically integrated whole sufficiently coherent, comprehensive and complex to serve as a laboratory. That laboratory 9s concreteness and accessibility make it ideal, its comprehensiveness makes it an inexhaustible source of data, and its relevance and importance to the young assures engagement long enough for the familiar to become cstrange enough to see. (12) Big idea: Every human, consciously and unconsciously, seeks answers to the questions, cWhat 9s going on here, and what should I therefore do? Lifting that process into consciousness turns information into knowledge, and sometimes turns knowledge into wisdom. It should go without saying that (6) through (12) require learners to hypothesize, generalize, infer, synthesize, relate, correlate, extrapolate, value, imagine and so on 4 thought processes too complex and idiosyncratic for their quality to be evaluated by standardized tests. Useful evaluations of meaningful learner work will inevitably be subjective, a fact which, when understood, helps explain why thoughtful teachers believe grading that work is counterproductive. As the curricular screw-tightening of the Common Core State Standards and high-stakes standardized tests makes clear, education policymakers routinely underestimate both the complexity of teaching and the ability of the young to think. It we change nothing and continue to assume that the core curriculum does the job that needs doing, that teacher experience isn 9t worth its cost, that class size makes no difference, that incompetent institutional leadership has no serious consequences, that H.G. Wells was wrong in arguing that civilization is a race between education and catastrophe, then over the educational catastrophe cliff isn 9t just possible, it 9s inevitable.

Marcus, President Trump 9s pick to head the Education Department 9s Office of Civil Rights, is coming under fire from critics who say they fear he will not protect the rights of racial and ethnic minority students. And his ardent support of Israel has sparked protests. Marcus,\\xa0president of a Jewish center for human rights who previously served in the George W. Bush administration, was approved\\xa0Thursday by the Senate\\xa0Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee\\xa0along with two other key Education Department officials. They include Mitchell Zais, a former South Carolina state schools superintendent who will serve as deputy to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The full Senate still must vote on the nominations. Marcus was tapped by Trump shortly after the president was criticized for blaming cboth sides for\\xa0violence that erupted in Charlottesville in August between\\xa0white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members and people who were protesting their presence. If confirmed, as expected, Marcus will be assistant secretary of civil rights, a position with which he is familiar; during the Bush administration, he was staff director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and he carried out the duties of the assistant secretary at the department. He would take over duties that have for months been carried out by Acting Assistant Secretary Candice Jackson. She also was\\xa0a controversial department official, in part for saying that 90 percent of campus sexual assault complaints are the result of too much drinking. She later apologized. _ Trump nominee for No. 2 spot at Education Department stumbles on key questions at confirmation hearing (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news /answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/15/trump-nominee-for-no-2-spot-at-education- department-stumbles-on-key-questions-at-confirmation- hearing/?utm_term=.88d08413d112)_ Marcus is president and general counsel of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law(http://brandeiscenter.com/)\\xa0in Washington, which says its mission is cto advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and to promote justice for all. d\\xa0 His official biography(http://brandeiscenter.com/about/president-biography/) says he founded the center in 2011 to ccombat the resurgence of anti-Semitism in American higher education. Marcus has been vocal in criticizing supporters of what is known as the Palestinian-led BDS\\xa0 4 or Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions 4 movement, which works to diminish international support for Israel economically, politically and academically. In a 2016 piece he wrote for Newsweek, (http://www.newsweek.com/anti-israel-boycott-legal-doesnt- look-460843)Marcus called BDS 9s academic boycott carguably anti- Semitic and criticized academic organizations that supported it. He has urged universities not to support calls to divest from Israel in support of\\xa0 BDS, and he has filed complaints with the Office for Civil Rights against several University of California campuses alleging anti-Semitic harassment of students. (The complaints were rejected.) In 2014, his center was one of a number of groups asking Congress to cend or mend(http://brandeiscenter.com/the-ldb-urges-congress-to-end-or-mend-hea- title-vi-diverse-perspectives-requirement/) federal funding for Middle East studies centers with what it called cbiased, politicized, anti- Israel and anti-American programming. At his confirmation hearing last month before the Senate panel, Palestinian supporters sat in the audience with their mouths taped shut, an effort to underscore their accusation that Marcus does not support free speech and that he makes no distinction between being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.A nonprofit group called Muslim Advocates sent a letter to Congress expressing concerns about Marcus 9s positions on a range of issues, including rights for LGBTQ students. It said in part: > While we take no position on the foreign policy merits of Mr. Marcus 9s views regarding the Middle East, his hostility to the civil right of free speech is well documented.\\xa0 He is a vocal antagonist of the right for college students who criticize Israel to express themselves and has even openly advocated for the abuse of OCR 9s civil rights complaint process to chill the speech of those with whom he disagrees. Marcus is supported by Republican senators on the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, including Lamar Alexander, who is chairman. Alexander, of Tennessee,\\xa0said at Marcus 9s confirmation hearing that Marcus chas a deep understanding of civil rights issues. And he said the committee had received letters from 13 individuals and organizations supporting Marcus 9s nomination, including one from Hillel International, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, which said: > Mr. Marcus has been a longtime champion for civil rights and for college students. We have worked personally with him on several campuses across the country in response to specific issues of bigotry and discrimination, and we have found him to be extremely skilled and knowledgeable in civil rights laws. Mr. Marcus has been a true leader in fighting discrimination.\\x85 But several civil rights organizations have\\xa0 come out against Marcus, including UnidosUS, the nation 9s largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization, and the National Urban League. The groups issued a joint statement saying\\xa0that Marcus had a ctroubling record with regard to enforcing the rights of immigrant students and English learners, and past attempts to undermine critical policies aimed at remedying racial discrimination, including affirmative action. Marc H. Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said in the statement: cMr. Marcus has a demonstrated history of hostility toward affirmative action and all race-based remedies to discrimination. He lacks a commitment to enforcing civil rights protections for students of color, and does not believe in disparate-impact or unintentional discrimination. All of which makes him unfit to lead ED 9s civil rights division. America 9s children both require and deserve an assistant secretary for civil rights who believes it is their birthright to receive a great, equitable public education. At his confirmation hearing in December, Marcus spoke about(https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marcus1.pdf) his experience in the Bush administration and said he worked hard to protect the educational rights of minorities and English-language learners. He said that all students, including transgender students, cdeserve equal access to education and should not be harassed and bullied. But he would not commit to investigating all complaints, saying they would be handled on a case-by-case basis. And he said he wasn 9t sure if the department had jurisdiction to protect the rights of undocumented students, as seen in this exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): > WARREN: Given the climate of fear and uncertainty that Donald Trump has created for Dreamers, if the school said happy to enroll all 5-year-olds in kindergarten, but kids who can 9t prove that they are citizens will be barred at the door. Would your office step in to protect the civil rights of those students from discrimination? > > MARCUS: Well, to my ear, senator, that sounds like a violation of law, but I don 9t know whether it would be a violation of one of the laws of which OCR has jurisdiction. There are certain rules here that would fall under the Equal Protection Clause. We would step in, if I were confirmed, if there 9s a violation of one of OCR 9s statutes. Here 9s another exchange between Warren and Marcus: > WARREN: Mr. Marcus, if confirmed, you would be responsible for protecting the civil rights of American students at a time when Nazis and white supremacists are marching across college campuses with tiki torches, and many young people are literally afraid to go to school because of the hateful climate that has been fostered by Donald Trump. If confirmed, will you commit to fully enforcing civil rights laws and protecting all students from discrimination and harassment? > > MARCUS: Yes. > > WARREN: Good. So, I just want to find out a little more detail about what that commitment means to you, and I thought we might go through a few fact situations. So, let 9s start with an easy one. Say there 9s a school district that has some mostly white schools and some mostly black schools, and let 9s say that the mostly black schools have less experienced teachers, teachers with fewer qualifications, those schools have fewer books, they have fewer computers in the library, fewer AP courses available. By any objective measure, those schools have clearly been shortchanged. If confirmed, would your office step in to protect the civil rights of that district 9s black students? > > MARCUS: If I were confirmed, I would ensure that any complaints alleging violation of Title VI would be 4 would be reviewed. > > WARREN: Mr. Marcus, I don 9t want to start a dance here. This is a set of facts that come to you in your position, if you are confirmed, and my question is are those facts adequate? Will you step in to protect the civil rights of the district 9s black students? > > MARCUS: Senator, I would certainly hope to be able to provide protection for the civil rights of those black students to the extent possible under law, but what . . . > > WARREN: But, that 9s the question I 9m asking how you see this. You 9re allowed to answer hypotheticals, here, so this one should be easy. A yes or a no, would you step in on those facts, or not? > > MARCUS: I appreciate that, senator, but unfortunately in my experience the cases that OCR deals with are much more complicated than hypotheticals. > > WARREN: So, you don 9t think that 9s enough evidence, what I 9ve just said? > > MARCUS: I think I would need to look at it very carefully. After questioning him, Warren said: cI don 9t think we need someone in this position whose view of civil rights enforcement is to do as little as possible to protect as few students as possible. I think that would be bad for students overall, and with Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, I think it would be even worse. The Senate committee also approved Zais as the department 9s No. 2. He is a former president of a\\xa0college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. And it approved Jim Blew, who was nominated to be assistant secretary for planning, evaluation and policy development. He was director of the Walton Family Foundation 9s K-12 reform efforts for nearly a decade,\\xa0and also national president of StudentsFirst, the reform organization started by former D.C. schools chancellor Michelle Rhee. There are 15 positions in the Education Department that must be confirmed, and so far the committee has confirmed four. One nominee was withdrawn by Trump, and six positions have no nominee\\xa0awaiting committee attention, according to a Washington Post tally. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics /trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/?utm_term=.a597d8bd5c4e)There are five positions with pending nominees, including Marcus, Zais and Blew. The committee announced Thursday it would hold a hearing next week to consider Trump 9s nomination of Frank Brogan, a former lieutenant governor of Florida and former chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, as assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education.

Students from Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian communities also face challenges because they are viewed as suspicious and dangerous in the post-9/11 environment. And, in the wake of Ahmed's encounter, other Muslim students reported(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mic .com_articles_125446_meet-2Dthe-2Dmuslim-2Dstudents-2Dwho-2Dhave-2Dbeen- 2Dharassed-2Dat-2Dschool-2Dfor-2Dless-2Dthan-2Da- 2Dclock-23.tsHOWCDJf&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=2KCFb_zuLj1Oz1ziFkw8Z8Fw7efHOdSk53f3zYYWa0g&e=) being targeted by anti-violent extremism initiatives at their schools, dragged out by school security personnel and suspended for minor infractions. These overall trends have continued since President Donald Trump took office. A 2017 poll(https://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AMP-2017_Full- Report.pdf) from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that one in four Muslim bullying incidents involves a teacher.

School administrators and educators must be cognizant of the racial realities that young people encounter daily. And the legal system must take seriously the complaints of young people of color who face police brutality, stop and frisk, deportations and the school- to-prison pipeline. Otherwise, young people will confront challenges ranging from achievement and wage gaps to isolation to a sense that they just don't belong in America. We can and must do better to address the racial realities that young people face in America today, and there are a few concrete steps we can take. School officials must heed the recommendations of organizations such as the Advancement Project(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https- 3A__advancementproject.org_resources_taking-2Drestorative-2Dpractices- 2Dschool- 2Dwide_&d=DwMFaQ&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=haYvn8UTtJhMJ5UTl6vlf47BSCqAnqLmI2yjukbrr3s&m =cTWmhbsAipQ3bMBURb0qld- fevLhl0VgnexKE2dLbCc&s=j9XBWD8Kjxl6XZHxQst3HqCbIfSb6wHegqdvfQx83zc&e=), a multiracial civil rights group, and Desis Rising Up and Moving,(http://www.drumnyc.org/institutionalizedbullying/) which organizes low-wage South Asian workers and youth in New York City, by focusing on opportunities for collaborative problem-solving rather than simply relying on punitive disciplinary measures. Schools must set and evaluate equity benchmarks to close the achievement gap that often widens when children of color are suspended or expelled. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Students and teachers should receive ongoing anti-racist training and address the consequences of systemic racism and intergenerational trauma through inclusive curricula and honest dialogues. School counselors must provide culturally specific services and resources to children who feel targeted to strengthen their mental well-being and self-esteem. Parent-teacher associations and school boards must ensure that schools remain places of sanctuary and refuge for students. And students must be supported so they can organize, dissent and raise their voices. There was a simple reason why Americans responded with compassion and outrage when they first heard about Ahmed Mohamed. The legal system may ignore the culture of anti-black and anti-Muslim bias that pervades our school systems and country. But we knew better then, and we must do our part now to fight for justice for Ahmed and children like him in America.  ",

Institutions like Cambridge, St Andrews, Bristol and Oxford were placed near the bottom of the table. Cambridge welcomed \"different interpretations of the data\". However, a spokesman for the university pointed out that the HEPI analysis relies on a single measure, adding \"widening participation in higher education is a complex issue\".      * I missed out on university but my son won't(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43084674)   * Wealthy students tighten university grip(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42339106)  Last year the charity Teach First compared official child poverty figures with university participation rates and found young people in some of the wealthiest areas of England were 18 times more likely(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40898523) to go to university than those in the poorest. Another analysis showed four fifths of students accepted at Oxford and Cambridge(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41664459) between 2010 and 2015 had parents in top professional and managerial jobs.  Neighbourhood chances Each year, admissions figures(http://www.hefce.ac.uk/analysis/yp/POLAR/), known as Participation of Local Areas (Polar), divide neighbourhoods into five groups, according to the proportion of young people going to university. In a perfect world each university would take a fifth of its students from each group, says HEPI. For this study, statisticians used the 2016 Polar data to rank each of the UK's 132 universities in terms of how near they came to this target.

Cambridge University said the Polar data takes no account of household income or access to education and \"effectively assumes that people living on the same street have the same likelihood of entering higher education as their neighbours\". The spokesman said Cambridge:   * Runs outreach programmes across the UK to raise aspirations among under-represented and disadvantaged groups   * Uses multiple measures to assess every applicant's educational and socio-economic background   * In 2017 had the highest level (63%) of state school applicants for 35 years and over 20% of students describe themselves as being from an ethnic minority.

(Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency) If Uncle Sam is committed to increasing the level of racial, ethnic and gender diversity in his government, particularly at the highest levels of the civil service, you sure can 9t tell it from the latest statistics. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) figures show diversity levels have improved little, stayed flat or, in some cases, regressed over the most recent period studied.  cThe percentage of minorities in the Senior Executive Service (SES) remained the same in FY 2016 as it was in FY 2015 at 21.2%, according to the recently released Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program Report to Congress(https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-and- inclusion/reports/feorp-2016.pdf) for fiscal year 2016, which was under the Obama administration. Women demonstrated the largest SES increase, with a 1 percentage-point bump to 35.3 percent, still far below their portion of the workforce. While there certainly have been advances since the first report, covering\\xa0fiscal year 2001, the gap between white men in top positions and other groups has always been substantial. White males made up 36.1 percent of the nation 9s civilian labor force in 2016. White people accounted for 78.8 percent of senior executives in 2015 and 2016 and were 66.4 percent of the national labor force. Bill Valdez, president of the Senior Executives Association, cited three reasons that diversity and inclusion (D&I) cefforts have stalled in the Federal government d:  * cAn absence of a link between mission accomplishment and D&I programs.  * cAn inability to articulate the return on investment (ROI) for D&I programs.  * cThe lack of a rigorous and analytical basis for D&I programs.  cHiring decisions that create a workforce that does not reflect the changing demographics of our nation are likely to have unintended consequences, Valdez said, csuch as investment decisions that do not address the needs of women and minorities, or the perpetuation of federal policies that have contributed to underrepresentation in the federal workforce. A deeper look into the generally stagnant people-of-color percentages reveals some ups and downs, albeit slight, among the groups. The largest variation was among African Americans, who are going backward in the SES, the highest civil- service rank. Their percentage dropped from 11.4 percent to 11 percent from 2015 to 2016. Asians increased from 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent, while Hispanics rose from 4.4 percent to 4.6 percent. That jump did little to bring SES Hispanics closer to their portion of the civilian labor force, which is 15 percent.\\xa0Hispanics\\xa0also are far behind in overall government employment, making up just 8.6 percent of federal employees. African Americans are 10.5 percent of the civilian labor force but 18.4 percent of federal employees. Civilian labor force percentages commonly are lower than population percentages.  cIt is obvious that Hispanic parity in the federal workforce will never be reached when compared with their numbers in the national civilian labor force, said Gilbert Sandate, chair of the Coalition for Fairness for Hispanics in Government. It estimates that this gap equals $8.5 billion in annual salaries lost to the Hispanic community. Government-wide data obscures wide variations among agencies. Black representation in executive departments, for example, ranges from about 38 percent in Education and Housing and Urban Development to a low of 5.6 percent in Interior. For Hispanics, the highest representation is 22 percent in Homeland Security; the lowest is 3.3 percent in Health and Human Services. HHS, however, has the highest percentage of women, at 64.9 percent. Transportation has the lowest, 26.2 percent. Using a Freedom of Information Act request, the Coalition for Change, an organization that focuses on bias in the federal workforce, found that from 2005 to 2015, 108 class-action complaints were filed regarding federal employment discrimination against black people.  cYear after year, thousands of black Americans, like the Black U.S. Marshals who have a pending class action against the U.S. Department of Justice, allege federal officials deprive them of career opportunities, such opportunities provide black Americans the avenue to attain Senior Executive Service Level positions, Tanya Ward Jordan, the coalition 9s founder and president, said\\xa0in an email. The OPM report does not cover President Trump 9s administration, but no one expects things to improve under this president. Quite the opposite.  cOur federal government functions best when it is equipped with qualified individuals\\xa0who meaningfully reflect and represent\\xa0the country they\\xa0serve, said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. cThere is\\xa0a stunning lack of diversity in the nominations Trump has put forward for judicial seats and executive branch\\xa0positions. It 9s clear he does not\\xa0value diversity and inclusion. The Leadership Conference pointed to a USA Today article(https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/trumps-87 -picks-federal-judges-92-white-just-one-black-and-one-hispanic- nominee/333088002/) that said 92 percent of Trump 9s judicial picks are white, adding, cPresident Trump 9s search for deeply conservative federal judges appears to have eliminated most African Americans and Hispanics from the running. Among Trump 9s first 87 judicial nominees, only one is African American and one is Hispanic. Five are Asian Americans.\\xa0Eighty are white. For Sandate, information like this means cthe prospects for brighter days ahead are dim when it comes to diversity in the federal workforce. At the end of its first year in power, the Trump administration has shown no signs of taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to emasculating agencies 9 budgets, missions and programs, and of marginalizing the rights of minorities, immigrants and people of color. **Read more:** It took 18 years, but\\xa0USDA\\xa0employee wins bias case again 4 showing how hard it is for feds to fight(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/06/it-took-18 -years-but-usda-employee-wins-bias-case-again-showing-how-hard-it-is-for-feds- to-fight-uncle-sam/) Kerner\\xa0Commission\\xa0member, staffers recall controversial report, at its 50th anniversary, blaming(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/02/kerner- commission-member-staffers-recall-controversial-report-at-its-50th- anniversary-blaming-racism-for-civil-disorders/) Rebel base names, statues disgrace U.S. military facilities and Congress(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/15/rebel- base-names-statues-disgrace-u-s-military-facilities-and-congress/) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  ",

Dhillon from the Dhillon Law Group, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in the lawsuit. cGoogle 9s open hostility for conservative thought is paired with invidious discrimination on the basis of race and gender. , Silicon Valley, often considered a bastion for liberal thinking, has been wrestling with how to deal with the culture wars(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/technology/the-culture-wars-have- come-to-silicon-valley.html) that have reverberated throughout the country. At the same time, technology firms are trying to address the shortage of women and minorities in their ranks. , Those issues are coming to a head at Google, one of the richest and largest technology companies in the world. Google is also fighting a pay discrimination lawsuit(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/technology/google- gender-pay-lawsuit.html) brought by four women who worked at the company. The women claim that Google systematically pays women less than men to do the same jobs. , Mr. Damore 9s memo last year argued that biological differences 4 citing greater levels of anxiety among women, and a lower tolerance for stress 4 helped explain why there were fewer women in key engineering positions and leadership roles at Google. His writing sparked outrage at the company and across Silicon Valley for rationalizing the pay and opportunity gap at technology companies. , Mr. Damore 9s dismissal became a rallying point for conservatives(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/technology/silicon-valley- men-backlash-gender-scandals.html) who saw technology companies as workplaces dominated by groupthink. Ms. Dhillon, the lawyer who brought the suit, is a committeewoman for California in the Republican National Committee. , Google did not provide immediate comment about the lawsuit. Sundar Pichai, the company 9s chief executive, said in the past(https://www.blog.google/topics/diversity/note-employees-ceo-sundar- pichai/) that Mr. Damore 9s memo had violated the company 9s code of conduct because it advanced charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.

It affects civic engagement, home ownership, job status, income, just to name a few things. And it affects health. In this piece, Karin Fischer writes about why education matters to your health 4 literally. Fischer is a\\xa0 senior reporter at the Chronicle of Higher Education(https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Education-Matters-to- Your/242123), where this first appeared, and which gave me permission to republish it. Karin Fischer covers the business of international education and the globalization of higher education, including competition for foreign students, activities by American colleges overseas, policies and programs that affect the international activities of American colleges, and the internationalization of the college experience. **_By Karin Fischer_** Across America, people are falling ill and dying young. These men and women have something in common. In fact, they stand out because of something they don 9t have: a college degree. A recent report,(https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/08/casetextsp17bpea.pdf) by Princeton University economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, made the stakes clear: Men and women who haven 9t been to college live shorter, less healthy lives, and are losing ground compared with college graduates. This is about more than money: the findings suggest that pain, stress, and social dysfunction may all play a role. Here 9s what you need to know about the research. Case and Deaton found that less-educated Americans were dying younger. Is that really so striking? In a word, yes. For decades, life expectancy for Americans has been improving, thanks to advancements in technology and medical care. Before 1999, middle-age mortality rates were declining by about 2 percent a year. But suddenly, starting in the late 1990s, rates of morbidity and mortality 4 in other words, of sickness and death 4 began to increase for white men and women between the ages of 45 and 54 who did not have a college degree. Since then those rates have been climbing by about half a percentage point a year among the white working class. cIn this historical context of almost continuous improvement, d\\xa0 Case and Deaton wrote, cthe rise in mortality in midlife is an extraordinary and unanticipated event. The researchers originally noticed rising death rates among the middle-aged and now see a similar deterioration for less-educated adults of all ages. The one exception is the elderly. At the same time, however, longevity has continued to improve for people who hold college degrees. The resulting disparity is striking: The mortality rate for 50- to 54-year-old men without a bachelor 9s degree is 867 per 100,000; for their more-educated peers, it 9s just 243. While there 9s long been a gap in health outcomes based on education, it looks now more like a yawning gulf. Is this just another way of saying that poor people are sicker? Yes, but that 9s not all that 9s going on. People with steady, well- paying jobs tend to be in better health, and that 9s especially true in the United States, where we have a system of employment-based health insurance. But the relationship between education and health is significant and independent of socioeconomic status. So, what 9s going on? Why does education matter? That 9s not an easy question to answer. Experts say there are all sorts of links between education and health,(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146517715671?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&) and whether there 9s a direct relationship between the two isn 9t entirely clear. People with degrees have more and better access to health care. They report greater job satisfaction and lower levels of stress. They read up on scientific breakthroughs and heed their doctor 9s advice when it comes to behaviors like eating healthfully, exercising, and quitting smoking. They are less likely to live near factories or freeways that belch pollutants into the air and are more apt to be surrounded by people like them, who reinforce healthful living. As one public-health researcher put it, the well-educated have a deeper bucket of resources to draw on. Case and Deaton, the Princeton economists, have their own idea, linking the increasing mortality rate to an uptick in deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and from suicide 4 what they call cdeaths of despair. Their theory goes like this: Over the past several decades, the economy has shifted, eliminating many of the jobs that once went to people without college degrees. The share of men in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who are not in the work force has more than tripled(ttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/12/upshot/where-men-arent- working-map.html) since the late 1960s. Those who do have jobs are unlikely to be pulling in the same sorts of wages as generations before them. Unable to provide a middle-class life, they may put off marriage; their social ties are often weaker. People without college degrees report being less happy than those with more years of schooling. As a result, they may turn to alcohol or drugs to cope. Deaths from opioids, in particular, have been soaring, and most of those who overdose are white. In short, the tough labor market may be at the root of the worsening mortality rates for those without higher education, but that 9s not the only thing to blame. Instability, dysfunction, stress: these cumulative disadvantages add up, exacting a deadly toll. You 9ve mentioned several times that death rates have climbed specifically for white Americans. Why focus on white people? Wouldn 9t members of minority groups be similarly affected by changes in the economy? Fair point 4 if anything, black and Hispanic Americans suffer from greater educational and economic inequities than their white counterparts do. Yet they have continued to show improvements in health and longevity. Partly it 9s that they 9ve long suffered from ill health and earlier deaths. Even with progress, there 9s still a long way to go. In fact, a new study(http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/13/1714616114.full.pdf) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill suggests that black and Hispanic young adults from poor backgrounds actually are in worse physical health if they complete college. Experts such as Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at the Johns Hopkins University, speculate that racial differences also might be a matter of expectations. It wasn 9t long ago that white working-class Americans(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/opinion/why-are-white-death- rates-rising.html) could count on leading a comfortable life with just a high- school degree. Middle-aged men and women, the very group falling ill and dying, are the first generation without that guarantee. They compare themselves with their parents and find their lives falling short. For black and Hispanic Americans, if you haven 9t got as much to hope for, you might just have less to lose. Come to think of it, you keep talking about Americans. What about people in other countries who don 9t have college degrees? Are they, too, getting sicker? They 9re not. Even right next door in Canada, longevity continues to improve. One reason might be that workers in other industrialized countries haven 9t experienced the same wage stagnation as have those here. But it 9s also the case that in Canada and throughout Europe, the social safety net is more pronounced. If where you live in the world makes a difference, are there healthier places within the United States? Case and Deaton play down geography in their work, saying that they spot the trend of increasing mortality across all regions of the country and in both rural and urban areas. But other researchers argue that location does matter. Rural America has been hit hard(https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Big- Bet-on-Higher/239585) by the changing economy, and the people there tend to be older, white, and less-educated than those in the cities and suburbs. What 9s more, a lot of public policy that affects the poor and less educated is set at the state and local levels(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865154/), points out Jennifer Karas Montez, an assistant professor of sociology at Syracuse University. That means there are places where it 9s tougher to be poor and without a degree. What 9s the solution: Just send more people to college? Few experts think that the answer is college for all. Instead they call for policy fixes that could help ease the disadvantage that comes from not having a degree. As a country, they argue, we should find more ways into the middle class that don 9t require a four-year degree, such as more-robust apprenticeship or training programs. They also call for strengthening the social safety net. States, for instance, could expand health coverage under the Affordable Care Act to help the working poor. They could raise cigarette taxes to make smoking cost-prohibitive for low-income residents. Education will still matter, but policy choices could mitigate its effect on health. It 9s true that more people today are earning college degrees, but perhaps that precisely why we ought to be worried about those who don 9t. While this group may be smaller, the disadvantages they face are compounding, and they are falling further behind. The divide between the haves and have-nots is widening.  ",

            "article": " MELBOURNE, Australia 4 At Lumineer Academy, a newly opened primary school in Williamstown, Australia, there is no homework. There are no classrooms, uniforms or traditional grades. , Instead, there are ccreator spaces, cblue-sky thinking sessions and cpitch decks. , If the school 4 furnished like a start-up with whiteboards and beanbag chairs 4 sounds like the idea of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, that 9s because it is. , That entrepreneur is Susan Wu, 44, an American who has been called one of the cmost influential women in technology(https://www.fastcompany.com/3017162/the-most-influential-women-in- technology-2010-susan-wu) and who has advised or invested in companies that include Twitter, Reddit and Stripe. , Ms. Wu and her team believe they are starting an education revolution. They say they have created a new model for teaching children, called Luminaria(http://www.luminaria.org/), that promises to prepare them to become the architects of 4 rather than mere participants in 4 a future world. ,  cOur current school models were built 100-plus years ago for the Industrial Revolution, said Ms. Wu. cWhat they cared about were homogeneous factories that produced a template of a kind of worker. The world has changed. , Critics, however, see Lumineer Academy(http://www.lumineer.edu.au/) as another in a series of attempts by Silicon Valley(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/technology/tech-billionaires- education-zuckerberg-facebook-hastings.html) to apply the same techniques used to churn out successful apps to instead turn out successful children. , In the United States, as more tech executives have tried their hands at opening schools, education experts have debated, and in some cases warned about, the effects of corporate money and influence(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/silicon-valley- baltimore-schools.html) pervading the classroom. , In recent years, schools and education programs have been founded by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla; Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; and Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce. , Despite glittering launches and promises to disrupt education, schools founded by tech executives have yet to demonstrate success. AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000. , Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school 9s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart. , Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools 4 nearly three times the rate of American children 4 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit. , Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education. , Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education 4 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria. , Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu 9s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school. ,  cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time, said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. cAlmost any problem space 4 no matter how different it is from the last 4 she seems to be able to tackle. , Lumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000. , Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.) , Classrooms in the school have been rebranded cstudios. There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working. , The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases. , Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums. ,  cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, 8This can 9t be true, 9 said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they 9re quite prescriptive. , Ms. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn 9t joined Ms. Wu 9s school. ,  cI felt like I was too restricted, she said. cI couldn 9t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them. , There is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school.

The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up 9s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch. , Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas. ,  cI was kind of impressed with the number of clich\\xe9s and buzzwords that they packed into a short amount of marketing copy, said Audrey Watters, whose blog, Hack Education(http://hackeducation.com/), analyzes the intersection of education and tech. cIn the case of Luminaria, they have everything, they have all the buzzwords: social and emotional learning, mind- sets, grit, S.T.E.M., mindfulness, authentic learning, global consciousness.

The school was one of the first in\\xa0Washington to move toward blended learning, in which students spend part of the day learning with teachers and the other\\xa0part learning online. (Photo by Linda Davidson / The Washington Post) How much do we really know about the effectiveness of online education? What happens to the personal data that students are required to provide to online learning providers? And, for that matter, what exactly is online education? These and other questions are addressed in a new report (https://networkforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Online- Learning-What-Every-Parent-Should-Know.pdf)that is a primer for parents and anyone else who wants to understand key issues surrounding what we call online learning. The report, cOnline Learning: What Every Parent Should Know, (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/22/university- of-wisconsin-students-protest-plan-to-drop-slew-of-liberal-arts-majors/)says that cshifting terminology of online learning is confusing, making it difficult for researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and the general public to know what K-12 online learning really is. The report\\xa0explains the different ways online education is provided to students, and looks at the issue of student data privacy, which gets short shrift from policymakers eager to push online education. Recent online data breaches 4 including Facebook 9s 4 show that kids 9 personal information isn 9t as private online as you may think. _ The astonishing amount of data being collected about your children (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/11/12/the- astonishing-amount-of-data-being-collected-about-your- children/?utm_term=.16e23061f847)_ The report was published by the nonprofit Network for Public Education, an advocacy group that fights to strengthen public schools. It was founded by education historian and advocate Diane Ravitch and educator Anthony Cody. The report notes that many students are required to use online programs, textbooks and apps as part of their schoolwork, and some states mandate that every student take at least one online course. Yet, it says: > The increased reliance on technology in schools is moving at a breakneck speed 4 one that far exceeds the accumulation of research on its effectiveness. Does online and blended learning enhance student learning? What do we know about virtual schools? How does profit influence policy decisions on the use of technology? > > Beyond questions of effectiveness, there are also student privacy concerns. Online learning, in all of its forms, captures a treasure trove of student data. Who owns the data and to what ends may it be used? Can private student information be sold for commercial purposes, with or without parental consent? What educational decisions are being made for students based on data that may or may not actually capture their achievement or abilities? In fact, some companies do use personal student data for marketing. A December 2017 letter from the\\xa0federal Education Department to Agora Cyber Charter Schools, an online chain owned by K12 Inc., ordered the company to stop violating federal privacy law by requiring parents who enroll their children to waive their rights to have their children 9s personal information protected from unrestricted disclosure and/or commercial use.

The local authority said other cuts being considered would affect services such as behaviour support and English as an additional language. The details are in a letter sent from the council to head teachers. In a statement, Highland Council said a \"wide range of proposals\" were being considered to help it make savings. The local authority's Independent-Lib Dem-Labour administration is having to tackle an estimated budget gap of \\xa325.8m in the coming financial year due what it what it calls the \"scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years\".     Cuts 'appalling' SNP councillor and former Dingwall Academy rector, Graham MacKenzie, has described the council's proposed cuts as \"appalling\" and said they would \"worsen\" the attainment gap in the Highlands. Teaching union the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said it would be concerned if the council pushed ahead with the proposals. In the letter, the council said reductions in additional support needs teachers and pupil support assistants had been proposed. However, it added that vacancies and the turnover in these roles were \"likely to protect all those presently in post\". Also proposed is a reduction in specialist additional support services, excluding NHS Highland-funded services. The letter said: \"This is likely to impact in educational psychology, behaviour support, English as an additional language, interrupted learning, autism, assistive technology, and pre-school support services.\" About 40 teaching posts could also be cut. This would affect medium-sized and larger secondary schools.  'Remain committed' Other possible savings outlined include having fewer crossing patrol personnel and \"significantly\" reducing funding to Inverness' Eden Court Theatre and to High Life Highland, which operates council-owned leisure centres, museums and libraries. The proposals will be considered by councillors on 15 February. In its statement, Highland Council said: \"We have managed to protect education in previous years, and there were no new saving measures for schools last year. \"But the scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years means it is no longer possible to sustain that level of protection. \"We remain committed to supporting education and maintaining teacher numbers as far as we can, and especially for primary schools and rural communities.\" It added \"Other councils have made savings on additional need services in previous years, and we are now having to consider that. \"Other than this, there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in 90% of Highland schools, as we will protect all primary schools and our smaller secondary schools.\" Alistair Bell, Highlands secretary of the EIS, said that while the details set out in the letter were only proposals at this stage they were still a cause for concern. He told BBC Radio Scotland: \"If this is what is going to happen it is a grave situation for what is already a stretched service. \"At a time when the Scottish government is asking teachers in schools to bridge the attainment gap, this can only hinder that process.\"   ",

Zeman, 73, is a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an early fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and campaigned by warning against Muslim migrants in a country with tiny religious minorities. His challenger, a 68 -year-old chemistry professor, vowed to creturn dignity to the post, a reference to Zeman 9s frequent clashes with media and political rivals. Opinion polls signaled a close race before the two-day runoff. Voting will resume at 8 a.m. and last until 2 p.m. Saturday, with results expected in the afternoon. The Czech Republic boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU, the lowest unemployment in the bloc and the highest living standards among its post-communist members. Still, Zeman has tapped anti-establishment sentiment that boosted populist politicians that challenged the EU 9s liberal, multi-cultural values elsewhere across the continent in elections last year. While the president has a largely ceremonial role, the post serves as an influential voice in public debate.      cCzech society is very divided, said Balazs Jarabik, a scholar at Carnegie Europe. cThe urban elites should show a bit more understanding toward rural voters. They really do have totally different possibilities. And the differences are only growing. !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJ3Z.QCPsoL4/v0/60x-1.jpg) Jiri Drahos, left, and Milos Zeman during a television debate on Jan. 23.

Critics say his pro-Russian and anti-migrant rhetoric, jokes about killing journalists, vegetarians and teetotalers and his support of extremist political forces including a far-right party that advocates leaving the EU, have undermined the authority of the presidency. Zeman calls himself a euro-federalist, but he also suggested that Czech Republic should hold a Brexit-style referendum to leave the EU. He said he 9d vote to stay in although people should have a choice.     During the campaign, the incumbent accused Drahos of being soft on refugees. His supporters ran a full-page add in Pravo newspaper on Thursday that said cStop the migrants and Drahos. This country is ours. While Drahos said the Czech Republic ccan handle some 2,600 refugees, he also opposes the EU 9s quotas for migrants.   ",

Scholars suggest various explanations(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/opinion/democracy- inequality-thomas-piketty.html). Here 9s one possibility that few have discussed: Poor voters may oppose a policy of higher taxes and income transfers because they wrongly think they 9ll be victims of it.  Defying logic The idea that in democracies the poor soak the rich goes back to Aristotle(http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.3.three.html). The economists Allan Meltzer and Scott Richard formalized(http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261013) the logic in a classic paper. If the majority gets to set a flat tax rate and share the revenue equally among all voters, then when incomes are especially unequal, the majority should set the rate higher. But in the United States, things haven 9t worked out that way. Rather than expropriating the wealthy, low-income voters in several swing states helped put a billionaire(https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/01/the- full-list-of-every-american-billionaire-2016/4bcce2ee37ac) in the White House who then slashed taxes on the rich. As Nicholas Carnes and Noam Lupu showed here(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/05/its-time- to-bust-the-myth-most-trump-voters-were-not-working-class/) last year, polls suggest most Trump voters had above-average income. But the crucial states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania all saw(http://www.weeklystandard.com /the-election-came-down-to-77744-votes-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-and-michigan- updated/article/2005323) big drops in the share of low-income voters supporting the Democratic candidate. Had large minorities of the poor not backed Trump in these states, Hillary Clinton would have won. Why don 9t poor Americans use their voting power to shrink the income gap? Some observers blame the Democratic Party(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871547651?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0871547651) for abandoning blue-collar workers to cater to educated elites. Others see the influence of racial(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FKRXYV4?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B01FKRXYV4) divisions or the power of tycoons(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/11/us/politics/2016 -presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html) and lobbyists to distort the agenda. These factors may well contribute. But there 9s another piece to the puzzle.  What you don 9t know can hurt you In a recent article, Vladimir Gimpelson and I show(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract) that in many countries 4 the United States included 4 most people simply don 9t know how high inequality is or where they fall in the distribution. Nor can they say reliably how it 9s been changing. _ Here 9s how little Americans have learned about Donald Trump (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/21/heres-how- little-americans-have-learned-about-donald-trump)_ On many different surveys, answering a range of questions, the average respondent guesses right about inequality only slightly more often than chance. Respondents do a little better in rich countries than in poor ones 4 but not by much. For a citizen to judge how redistribution will affect her, she needs to know how her income compares to those of others. Is she among the rich who pay more in taxes than they get back from public programs 4 or the poor, who come out ahead? Many don 9t know. In 2015, Ipsos MORI asked respondents in 28 countries to guess the average annual wage. That year in the United States, the correct answer was around $59,000, according to the OECD(http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=AV_AN_WAGE). The average guess was less than half that 4 about $26,000(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract). (Even if we suppose respondents had in mind post-tax not pretax income, the guesses were way too low.) Another survey in 2007 asked Americans about average household income(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168014545414). The median respondent guessed $40,000. According to the Census Bureau, average household income that year was $69,193(https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_07_1YR_S1901&prodType=table) 4 again, much higher than the typical answer. _ You need two things for a successful anti-violence movement. Post-Parkland activism about guns has both. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey- cage/wp/2018/02/23/why-neveragain-is-different-from-earlier-movements-against- gun-violence)_ Suppose that 4 as the Meltzer-Richard theory predicts 4 those with below average wages or favor income redistribution while those with higher wages or income oppose it. Clearly, a lot of Americans who fall below the true average think they are above it. That implies that many who would benefit from redistribution wrongly think that they would lose.  The Lake Wobegon effect This fits with another common bias. People tend to think they are closer to the middle of the income distribution than they actually are. As in Garrison Keillor 9s fictional town(https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/garrison_keillor_137097) where all children are above average, residents of many countries like to think they are close to the mean. The poor underestimate how much the rich earn, while the rich underestimate the poverty of the poor. Some misperceptions appear extreme. For instance, among the 5 percent of U.K. respondents who said they or their family owned two homes, a whopping 40 percent thought they were in the bottom half of the income distribution. Meanwhile, 19 percent of Americans who said they had coften or csometimes gone without enough food in the previous year placed themselves 4 implausibly 4 in the _highest_ -earning half. Across countries, actual levels of inequality bear little relation to the percentage who think government should reduce the income gap. But the level of inequality citizens perceive(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12103/abstract) correlates strongly with demand for more redistribution. If people are misinformed, would education solve the problem? Not necessarily. Some research suggests people resist changing their minds even when confronted with contrary facts. For instance, Eric Lawrence and John Sides(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168014545414) found that respondents, even after learning average income was higher than they had thought, were no readier to support aid to the poor or job training programs. Ilyana Kuziemko, Michael Norton, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360), using an online survey, randomized whether respondents received information about inequality, but found this had little or no effect on their attitudes toward income tax rates and transfer programs. The source of information matters. People are readier to believe a message when it comes from a person 4 or political party 4 that usually argues the opposite(https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal- of-political-science/article/rumors-and-health-care-reform-experiments-in- political-misinformation/8B88568CD057242D2D97649300215CF2). If Republicans said inequality was too high and advocated aid to the poor, that would get attention. Of course, that 9s unlikely to happen. All parties portray reality in ways that serve their base. Wealth may be different. Unlike with income, Americans overestimate(https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2017-07/ipsos-perils- of-perception-charts-2015.pdf) the asset share of the top 1 percent. And attitudes toward the estate tax seem more responsive to facts. Telling respondents how few Americans are subject to it 4 less than 1 percent(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360) 4 increases the share that support the estate tax (by 11(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X15610190) percentage points) and that favor raising its rate (by 36(https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130360) percentage points). Misperceptions are certainly not the only reason poor Americans resist higher taxes to pay for programs that would benefit them. Culture, racial prejudice and political messaging also contribute. But the desire of millions to see themselves as more or less average may help explain why they don 9t use their voting power to shape public policies in their interest. _Daniel Treisman(https://www.danieltreisman.org/) is a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles. _  ",

The Brilliant Club(http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/) is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal. In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15. In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.  University gap This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.     Image caption Pupils get extra lessons with postgraduate students, showing them university is in reach  The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%. Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome. In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and \"classrooms fit for purpose\". In Philippi, she says: \"The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT information and communications technology. \"With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa.\" Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.  Image caption Putting young people in the frame for university  While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the \"academic and social skills\" needed to complete their degrees. But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons. The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking. In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and see, perhaps for the first time, what it's like to be a student and to show that it's an accessible target.  Unequal chances It's a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.  Image caption When pupils complete the course, they go on a visit to university to find about life as a student  University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education. Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year. But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered. Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university. \"Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement,\" says the impact report on AccessEd's pilot phase. But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal. * * * More from Global education(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * Liberia's big school experiment(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * Helping to keep girls in school in India(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * Terror survivor campaigns for open speech(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the Global education series(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

The move has been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney in a bid to tackle a recruitment crisis in the profession. The Scottish government said it was providing \\xa31.3m to create hundreds more opportunities for people to qualify as teachers. Edinburgh's Queen Margaret and Napier universities will train new recruits from 2019. Mr Swinney said the government was addressing difficulties recruiting classroom staff and he hoped this would \"build capacity within teacher education\".    It comes as the EIS teaching union warned schools are facing a recruitment \"crisis\" - with this one of the reasons why they are demanding a 10% wage rise for teachers.  'Raising standards' Edinburgh Napier University will initially offer a total of 30 places on a one-year Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) course - which allows those who already have a degree to train as teachers - with a focus on maths and sciences. It is planned to expand that into areas such as English and computing, with up to 150 training places after three years. Queen Margaret University will recruit up to 120 students to an undergraduate primary course but will also have 20 places on a PGDE course for those who wish to be home economics teachers.  Image caption The move could create hundreds of new teachers  Mr Swinney said: \"Teachers have a key role to play in helping us raise standards and close the attainment gap. That is why we are doing everything we can to attract talented and enthusiastic people to the profession. \"We recognise that, in common with many other countries, it is hard to recruit teachers in the numbers we need, particularly in certain specialist subjects. \"Adding two additional universities to the institutions that offer initial teacher education, supported by \\xa31.3 million investment from the Scottish Government, means we can not only recruit additional teachers to take up post within the next two years but build capacity within teacher education. \"The two new teacher training courses offer more choice and flexibility for anyone considering teaching as a career, especially in the specialist home economic and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects where we know there are shortages at the moment.\"  'By teachers, for teachers' Kenneth Muir, chief executive and registrar of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, hailed the move as a \"landmark development in the provision of initial teacher education\". He added: \"We must continue to adapt to ensure we do not miss out to other professions on new, high quality teaching talent. \"It is important that high standards are maintained and we will ensure the courses offered by QMU and Napier universities satisfy fully our accreditation criteria.\" Alistair Sambell, vice principal and deputy vice chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, said: \"Our new teacher education programme will be designed by teachers, for teachers. \"As a university we have an applied approach to learning, and student placements in schools will be underpinned by practice-based learning in class, supported by practising teachers.\" Prof Petra Wend, principal of Queen Margaret University, added: \"Teacher education at QMU will offer research-informed, practice-based programmes developed in collaboration with professionals from the sector and inspired by the needs of Scottish children and schools today.\"   ",

Just like in any other discipline, English teachers have way more curriculum than we can cover in a year.\\xa0 Time constraints force educators to prioritize by order of what feels most important, and all too often that importance is determined by what 9s going to be on the test. Our students pay the price as activities that cultivate essential real-world skills such as collaboration and creativity and provide them with a much more engaging and well-rounded education are eliminated from their classes. Educators are under enormous pressures stemming from a data-driven culture most recently rooted in No Child Left Behind and its successor, the Every Student Succeeds Act, in which the ultimate measure of professional and academic success is a standardized test score. As a result of this standardized testing culture, many of our English students spend way too much time reading random passages which are completely detached from their lives and answering multiple choice questions in an attempt to improve test results.\\xa0 In many classrooms, writing has become little more than an afterthought(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.d0ecfaa28732). Creative writing, in particular, is seen by some as a frivolous waste of time because its value is so difficult to justify with data. _ Teacher: What happened when I stopped viewing my students as data points (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/10/11/teacher-what- happened-when-i-stopped-viewing-my-students-as-data- points/?utm_term=.e96d3c779c3f)_ Two decades before the advent of No Child Left Behind, the research of influential literacy professor Gail Tompkins identified seven compelling reasons(https://www.ericdigests.org/1996-3/writing.htm) why children should spend time writing creatively in class: _\\xa0_  * to entertain  * to foster artistic expression  * to explore the functions and values of writing  * to stimulate imagination  * to clarify thinking  * to search for identity  * to learn to read and write The majority of Tompkins 9s outcomes of creative writing could never be measured on today 9s standardized tests.\\xa0 Indeed, over the same period that standardized reading tests have pushed writing in English classes to the sidelines, efforts to evaluate student writing on a broad, systematic scale have dwindled.\\xa0 Measuring student writing is expensive, and accurately assessing abstract thinking requires human resources most states aren 9t willing to pony up.\\xa0 It 9s much cheaper to score a bubble sheet. Measurement and assessment aside, the soft skills that we cultivate through regular creative writing with our students have tremendous real-world application as well as helping to promote the kind of atmosphere we want in our classrooms.\\xa0 After many years as an English teacher, I 9ve found that carving out regular time for creative writing in class provides benefits for me and my students that we simply don 9t get from other activities. One of the benefits of creative writing in the classroom is how engaging it is for our students.\\xa0 In general, much of our curriculum follows a one-size- fits-all design and allows little room for freedom of exploration. For young people who are at a time in life when many of their decisions are made for them, this lack of power can be very demotivating and can negatively impact their interest and effort.\\xa0 To do their best work, students need to feel that school is about them, and they need to feel connected to the content on a personal level.\\xa0\\xa0 When students are given opportunities to experiment with their voices and create through their own original work, they feel a sense of place and they are able to feel in charge.\\xa0 That 9s when they shine. A former student and talented writer told me the following about her relationship with creative writing in the classroom: _\\xa0_ > Creative writing is important to me because it gives me a way to express myself. There are not a lot of ways, as a young teenager, to be able to freely express ideas and emotions. Many are personal feelings you wouldn 9t really want to share with others. But in writing you can put all of those mixed emotions into words. Next thing you know, you 9ve created an entirely different universe, with characters close to your heart. Everything is under your complete control. That is not something that you can experience in reality, even reading a book. The feeling that you have created something, something that you can call your own, is what makes it incredible. When we empower our students to create something that is only theirs, to make big choices in their writing, it can transform attitudes toward learning and school in general.\\xa0 Having students who are motivated to work to their full potential is a dream scenario for any teacher.\\xa0 Regular creative writing can help us to move in that direction. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8K3M3Vh_C9VYIHxPNgEqX578qqg=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLU33FNQF44V5K3LVOOELH333A.jpg)  Another very real benefit of creative writing in the classroom is that it can help to develop a sense of community among our students.\\xa0 In our bitterly polarized society, any activity that fosters empathy and collaboration is well worth our time. Students can share writing with each other at the drafting phase, working together to hone their individual stories.\\xa0 This teamwork allows our students to support each other and work to understand each other 9s perspectives.\\xa0 In addition to peer editing, having students co-author creative pieces, whether as an informal cchain story type activity or a longer, more polished product, can go a long way in nurturing the skills required for effective partnership.\\xa0 Sharing responsibility in the creative process serves as a powerful motivator for our students, often leading to better quality writing. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tyjx1BVSC7AUFaJhbM_lDgsVNsY=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GGVJHNNS4QZ2ZM7BOHLJD652LY.jpg)  It 9s unlikely that our English teachers are going to get the additional time they so desperately need.\\xa0 What we 9re left with is the task of prioritizing class content in such a way that we 9re truly meeting all the needs of our students. Data is an important tool in helping us to measure how well we 9re meeting those needs, but our definition of data must be broad enough to include outcomes that can 9t be captured with a standardized test.\\xa0 We must trust our English teachers to plan instruction that is in the best interests of their students and to know when they 9ve succeeded. As a regular part of that instruction, creative writing can empower our students and give them ownership so critical to their motivation.\\xa0 It can provide them essential practice at partnering with their peers in a world where more effective collaboration is sorely needed. At its most powerful, creative writing can help turn our English courses into the life-changing experience that all educators want their classes to be.  ",

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) The latest flap surrounding Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stems from her inability to answer basic questions about schools during an interview she gave to Lesley Stahl on CBS 9s c60 Minutes on Sunday night. But it wasn 9t the first time she has revealed a lack of knowledge about fundamental education issues in front of a big audience 4 or said something that infuriated advocates of public schools. Here are nine things DeVos has said 4 or refused to say 4 in recent years that explain her views and philosophy about education in the United States: **1)** In 2015, before she became education secretary in the administration of President Trump, she said flatly that traditional public schools are ca dead end. That encapsulates the longtime view that DeVos has held 4 and spent decades advocating. She and her husband, Amway heir Richard DeVos, have spent time and money on school choice advocacy for decades. They were instrumental in pushing through Michigan 9s charter school law in 1993, and they support programs that use public money for private and religious school tuition 4 a position that critics say shows her desire to privatize U.S. public education. As education secretary, DeVos has said repeatedly that her definition of holding school districts caccountable d\\xa0is how many alternatives to traditional public schools they offer to families. Here 9s a quote from a speech she gave at the 2015 SXSW EDU convention in Austin: > We are the beneficiaries of start-ups, ventures, and innovation in every other area of life, but we don 9t have that in education because it 9s a closed system, a closed industry, a closed market. It 9s a monopoly, a dead end. And the best and brightest innovators and risk-takers steer way clear of it. As long as education remains a closed system, we will never see the education equivalents of Google, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, Wikipedia or Uber. We won 9t see any real innovation that benefits more than a handful of students. **2)** Then there was the infamous comment she made about schools and guns and bears. During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked\\xa0whether DeVos would agree that guns don 9t belong in schools. She said: > cI will refer back to Sen. Mike Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies. That statement is often held up as an example of her inability to articulate an answer to a question in a setting where many expected her to be more prepared, such as her confirmation hearing or her c60 Minutes interview. When the Senate voted in February 2017 to confirm her as education secretary, she became the first Cabinet nominee in history to need a vice president, in this case Mike Pence, to break a tie. That underscored her status as the most controversial in a pool of controversial Trump nominees. _ Six astonishing things Betsy DeVos said 4 and refused to say 4 at her confirmation hearing (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/01/18/six-astonishing-things-betsy-devos-said-and-refused-to- say-at-her-confirmation-hearing/?utm_term=.d96738a0a0b4)_ **3)** Just three weeks after becoming education secretary, DeVos displayed her unwavering focus on school choice 4 and a misunderstanding of the history of historically black colleges and universities by calling these institutions cpioneers of cschool choice. Actually, black students were barred from white institutions and had no choice but to go to schools specifically created for them. Here 9s what the statement said in part: > cThey started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn 9t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. She later walked back the cpioneers of cschool choice notion in a series of tweets. **4)\\xa0** She has refused to say whether the federal government should prevent private schools that accept public money from discriminating against some students. She said it was up to the states. At a May 2017 budget hearing before the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, Rep. Katherine M. Clark\\xa0(D-Mass.) said\\xa0one private school in Indiana that accepts publicly funded vouchers maintains it may deny admission to LGBT students or those coming from families with chomosexual or bisexual activity. Clark asked DeVos whether she would tell the state of Indiana it could not discriminate\\xa0that way if it accepted federal funding, and she asked DeVos what she would say if a voucher school rejected African American students but a state csaid it was okay. DeVos responded: cWell again, the Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX protections are broadly applicable across the board, but when it comes to parents making choices on behalf of their students. . . Clark interrupted and said, cThis isn 9t about parents making choices; this is about the use of federal dollars. Is there any situation? Would you say to Indiana, that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars? Or would you say the state has the flexibility? DeVos said: cI believe states should continue to have flexibility in putting together programs . . . _ Five startling things Betsy DeVos just told Congress (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/24/five- startling-things-betsy-devos-just-told-congress/?utm_term=.2923e7fe99f8)_ **5)** And she repeatedly disparages people who disagree with her views (though she isn 9t the first U.S. education secretary to do). At a May 2017 speech she gave in Indianapolis to the American Federation for Children 9s National Policy Summit,\\xa0an organization promoting school choice that\\xa0she founded and led, DeVos said: > cIn order to succeed, education must commit to excellence and innovation to better meet the needs of individual students. Defenders of our current system have regularly been resistant to any meaningful change. In resisting, these 8flat-Earthers 9 have chilled creativity and stopped American kids from competing at the highest levels. Our current framework is a closed system that relies on one-size-fits-all solutions. We need an open system that envelopes choices and embraces the future. **6)** Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord on June 1, and DeVos issued a statement applauding the move. When reporters asked her a few days later about her views on climate change, she responded: > cCertainly, the climate changes. Yes. Not only was that an example of her refusal to directly answer many questions, but it also suggested\\xa0the U.S. education secretary supports Trump 9s view that human-caused climate change is not real 4 despite\\xa0overwhelming scientific evidence that it is. **7)** During her interview with Stahl on c60 Minutes, DeVos acknowledged she had never cintentionally visited a low-performing traditional public school, and she made this unusual statement: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Here 9s part of the conversation about what happens to underperforming traditional public schools when children leave for alternatives and take funding with them: > STAHL: cWhy take away money from that school that 9s not working 4 to bring them up to a level where they are,\\xa0that school is working? > > DEVOS: cWell, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school, school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. > > STAHL: cOkay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that 9s not working? What about those kids? > > DEVOS: cWell, in places where there have been, where there is, a lot of choice that 9s been introduced, Florida, for example, the studies show that when there 9s a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually, the results get better, as well. > > STAHL: cNow, has that happened in Michigan? We 9re in Michigan. This is your home state. > > DEVOS: cYes, well, there 9s lots of great options and choices for students here. > > STAHL: cHave the public schools in Michigan gotten better? > > DEVOS: cI don 9t know. Overall, I, I can 9t say overall that they have all gotten better. > > STAHL: cThe whole state is not doing well. > > DEVOS: cWell, there are certainly lots of pockets where this, the students are doing well and . . . > > STAHL: cNo, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. > > DEVOS: cI hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. > > STAHL: cThe public schools here are doing worse than they did. > > DEVOS: cMichigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. > > STAHL: cHave you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they 9re doing? > > DEVOS: cI have not, I have not, I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. > > STAHL: cMaybe you should. > > DEVOS: cMaybe I should. Yes. **8)** At her 2017 confirmation hearing before the Senate panel, DeVos seemed not to understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. DeVos said states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it. > HASSAN: cDo you stand by your statement a few minutes ago that IDEA should be up to the states whether to follow it? > > DEVOS: cFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play. > > HASSAN: cSo were you unaware, when I just asked you about the IDEA, that it was a federal law? > > DEVOS: cI may have confused it. She did confuse it in a most fundamental way. **9)** In 2017, DeVos rescinded Obama-era Title IX guidelines on how schools should handle allegations of sexual assault. Saying that too many men were falsely accused, she set new rules making it harder for accusers to prove their accusations. During a Sept. 7 speech on the subject(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/12 /education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60-minutes- interview/?utm_term=.5329f9e47b6d), she said: > cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. Actually, survivors had pleaded with her not to change the rules, saying the Obama regulations gave them a voice they did not previously have. Many were furious at her decision.  ",

(Screen shot by The Washington Post) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered her first speech of 2018 and flatly declared that school reform efforts under\\xa0Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had not worked 4 nor had any other reform effort by any education secretary. She also said\\xa0the establishment of the Education Department by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 was essentially a cgiant nod to union bosses. DeVos gave a keynote address at the American Enterprise Institute 9s conference titled cBush-Obama School Reform: Lessons Learned, and then answered questions from Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the conservative think tank. Here are some things she said 4 and didn 9t say 4 in her speech and in her conversation with Hess, followed by the text of the speech: **DeVOS :** > The federal-first approach did not start with No Child Left Behind. The push for higher national standards was present in the Clinton administration 9s cGoals 2000 initiative. Before that, we had President George H.W. Bush 9s cAmerica 2000, also calling for higher national standards. These followed the Reagan administration 9s cNation at Risk report, released in 1983. That report gave dire warnings about the country 9s track if education was not reformed. cIf an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, the report warned, cwe might well have viewed it as an act of war. That came after President Carter 9s giant nod to union bosses: the establishment of the Department of Education, with the ironic charge to cprohibit federal control of education. . . . > We saw two presidents George W. Bush and Obama from different political parties and philosophies take two different approaches. Federally mandated assessments. Federal money. Federal standards. All originated in Washington, and none solved the problem. Too many of America 9s students are still unprepared. When Hess asked her if there was a single Obama or Bush school reform initiative that was successful, she said she couldn 9t think of one. What she didn 9t say was that the school reform she supports 4 the wide expansion of school choice in the form of charter schools and programs that use public money for private schools 4 has not shown to be a solution to the problems she says plague U.S. schools.  4 **DEVOS:** > Most teachers feel they have little 4 if any 4 say in their own classrooms.\\xa0 That statistic should shock even the most ardent sycophant of cthe system. It 9s yet another reason why we should shift power over classrooms from Washington back to teachers who know their students well. Federal mandates distort what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. . . . > > Let 9s trust teachers, too. Let 9s encourage them to innovate, to create new options for students. Not just with public charter schools or magnet schools or private schools, but within the traditional csystem and with new approaches yet to be explored. She didn 9t mention that she has done nothing to empower teachers but instead has supported efforts to diminish the role of their unions, which provide due-process rights. In the speech, in fact, she takes a few potshots at the teachers unions, calling them cChicken Littles, even though early in the talk she promised not to cimpugn anyone 9s motives or to do any cfingerpointing. Her comment is clearly about traditional public schools, and she doesn 9t mention that teachers in many charter schools also don 9t feel as if they have any say in their own classrooms.  4 **DEVOS:** > I agree 4 and have always agreed 4 with President Trump on this: cCommon Core is a disaster. And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead. What she didn 9t say was that the Common Core State Standards, while dead at her department, are not dead in most states, even if the name of the standards has been changed in some of states.\\xa0A November 2017 report by Achieve(https://www.achieve.org/state-standards-remain-strong), an education organization that was involved with the creation of the standards, analyzed state standards and found that the essence of the Core standards in English language arts and math still stand in most states. At least in this speech she didn 9t say 4 as she and President Trump have in the past 4 that they would kill the Common Core. The federal government can 9t do that; it 9s up to state officials.  4 **DEVOS:** > Our children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach. They deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced and challenging life-long learning journey. Schools should be open to all students 4 no matter where they 9re growing up or how much their parents make. > > That means no more discrimination based upon Zip code or socio-economic status. All means all. > > It 9s about educational freedom! Freedom from Washington mandates. Freedom from centralized control. Freedom from a one-size-fits-all mentality. Freedom from cthe system. What she didn 9t say is what she said more plainly in 2015 and implied here: that the traditional public education system is ca dead end. _ To Trump 9s education pick, the U.S. public school system is a 8dead end 9 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2016/12/21/to-trumps-education-pick-the-u-s-public-school-system-is-a -dead-end/?utm_term=.294bacec0aba)_ _ How Betsy DeVos has mastered the art of the non-answer (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/06/03/how-betsy- devos-has-mastered-the-art-of-the-non-answer/?utm_term=.fb022a42934e)_ **Here 9s the text of the speech as prepared for delivery and provided by the U.S. Education Department. She refers to Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, and AEI research fellow Michael Q. McShane.  ** > Thank you, Rick, for that kind introduction. Who would 9ve thought that after we were last together on a panel in Grand Rapids a couple of years ago, I 9d be here in this capacity today? > > It 9s an honor to be with all of you at an organization I have long appreciated. AEI is now in its 80th year and in that near century, the Institute 9s scholars have influenced and shaped the way Americans think about so many issues in the public square. AEI has been 4 and will continue to be 4 a treasured constant in this town of transition. And it should be noted that 9s due in no small part to the leadership of Arthur Brooks, who brings a unique and compelling perspective. I 9m grateful to call him a friend. > > I 9d like to especially thank Rick and Michael for putting this volume together and for hosting today 9s important discussions. Both of you have contributed significantly to the policy debates in American education, and, importantly, you 9ve put your distinct perspectives and experience to work with the goal of improving education for all. You both left the classroom out of frustration, and there are still far too many teachers who share that experience today. > > My work over thirty years has revolved around time spent on the outside, looking in. Outside Washington. Outside the LBJ building. Outside cthe system. Some have questioned the presence of an outsider in the Department of Education, but, as it 9s been said before, maybe what students need is someone who doesn 9t yet know all the things you ccan 9t do. > > To a casual observer, a classroom today looks scarcely different than what one looked like when I entered the public policy debate thirty years ago. Worse, most classrooms today look remarkably similar to those of 1938 when AEI was founded. Take a look at this! She shows some slides. These two operating rooms look starkly different, as does this general store and this website. But these two classrooms look almost identical. > > The vast majority of learning environments have remained the same since the industrial revolution, because they were made in its image. Think of your own experience: sit down; don 9t talk; eyes front. Wait for the bell. Walk to the next class. Repeat. Students were trained for the assembly line then, and they still are today. > > Our societies and economies have moved beyond the industrial era. But the data tell us education hasn 9t. > > The most recent Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, report, with which you are all familiar, has the U.S. ranked 23rd in reading, 25th in science and 40th in math. And, you know this too: it 9s not for a lack of funding. The fact is the United States spends more per pupil than most other developed countries, many of which perform better than us in the same surveys. > > I know that hard truth touches a nerve for everyone in this room. It does so for educators who try to help their students realize their potential. For employers who seek prepared employees. And, most importantly, for parents who only want the best for their children. > > Of course there have been many attempts to change the status quo. We 9ve seen valiant efforts to improve education from Republicans and Democrats, liberals, conservatives and everyone in between. > > That 9s because everyone is aiming for the same result. > > Everyone wants students to be prepared and to lead successful lives. > > We can 9t say that sort of public harmony exists in other policy arenas. Not everyone agrees about the outcome or goal of tax policy or energy policy or immigration policy. > > Our unity of purpose here presents an opportunity. > > But while we 9ve changed some aspects of education, the results we all work for and desire haven 9t been achieved. > > The bottom line is simple: federal education reform efforts have not worked as hoped. > > That 9s not a point I make lightly or joyfully. Yes, there have been some minor improvements in a few areas. But we 9re far from where we need to be. We need to be honest with ourselves. The purpose of today 9s conversation is to look at the past with 20/20 hindsight, examine what we have done and where it has 4 or hasn 9t 4 led us. > > First, let me be clear that I 9m not here to impugn anyone 9s motives. Every one of us wants better for students. We want better for our own children. We want better for our communities and our country. We won 9t solve any problems through finger-pointing. > > I also don 9t intend to criticize the goals of previous administrations 9 education initiatives. In the end, every administration has tried to improve education for students and grow the number who are learning valuable skills. > > We should hope 3 no, we should commit 3 that we as a country will not rest until every single child has equal access to the quality education they deserve. Secretary Spellings was right to ask cwhose child do you want to leave behind? > > But the question remains: why, after all the good intentions, the worthwhile goals, the wealth of expertise mustered, and the billions and billions of dollars spent, are students still unprepared? > > With No Child Left Behind, the general consensus among federal policymakers was that greater accountability would lead to better schools. Highlighting America 9s education woes had become an American pastime, and, they thought, surely if schools were forced to answer for their failures, students would ultimately be better off. > > President Bush, the ccompassionate conservative, and Senator Kennedy, the cliberal lion, both worked together on the law. It said that schools had to meet ambitious goals\\u2026 or else. Lawmakers mandated that 100 percent of students attain proficiency by 2014. This approach would keep schools accountable and ultimately graduate more and better-educated students, they believed. > > Turns out, it didn 9t. Indeed, as has been detailed today, NCLB did little to spark higher scores. Universal proficiency, touted at the law 9s passage, was not achieved. As states and districts scrambled to avoid the law 9s sanctions and maintain their federal funding, some resorted to focusing specifically on math and reading at the expense of other subjects. Others simply inflated scores or lowered standards. > > The trend line remains troubling today. According to the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress data, two-thirds of American fourth graders still can 9t read at the level they should. And since 2013, our 8th grade reading scores have declined. > > Where the Bush administration emphasized NCLB 9s stick, the Obama administration focused on carrots. They recognized that states would not be able to legitimately meet the NCLB 9s strict standards. Secretary Duncan testified that 82 percent of the nation 9s schools would likely fail to meet the law 9s requirements 4 thus subjecting them to crippling sanctions. > > The Obama administration dangled billions of dollars through the cRace to the Top competition, and the grant-making process not so subtly encouraged states to adopt the Common Core State Standards. With a price tag of nearly four and a half billion dollars, it was billed as the clargest- ever federal investment in school reform. Later, the Department would give states a waiver from NCLB 9s requirements so long as they adopted the Obama administration 9s preferred policies 4 essentially making law while Congress negotiated the reauthorization of ESEA. > > Unsurprisingly, nearly every state accepted Common Core standards and applied for hundreds of millions of dollars in cRace to the Top funds. But despite this change, the United States 9 PISA performance did not improve in reading and science, and it dropped in math from 2012 to 2015. > > Then, rightly, came the public backlash to federally imposed tests and the Common Core. I agree 4 and have always agreed 4 with President Trump on this: cCommon Core is a disaster. And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead. > > On a parallel track, the Obama administration 9s School Improvement Grants sought to fix targeted schools by injecting them with cash. The total cost of that effort was seven billion dollars. > > One year ago this week, the Department 9s Institute of Education Sciences released a report on what came of all that spending. It said: cOverall, across all grades, we found that implementing any SIG-funded model had no significant impacts on math or reading test scores, high school graduation, or college enrollment. > > There we have it: billions of dollars directed at low-performing schools had no significant impact on student achievement. > > These investments were meant to spark meaningful reforms. Schools were encouraged to significantly alter their teaching staffs, fire the principal or change the structure and model of the school. But most glossed over those recommendations. They simply took the federal money and ran the school the same old way. > > So where does that leave us? We saw two presidents from different political parties and philosophies take two different approaches. > > Federally mandated assessments. Federal money. Federal standards. All originated in Washington, and none solved the problem. Too many of America 9s students are still unprepared. > > Perhaps the lesson lies not in what made the approaches different, but in what made them the same: the federal government. Both approaches had the same Washington cexperts telling educators how to behave. > > The lesson is in the false premise: that Washington knows what 9s best for educators, parents and students. > > Rick, you 9ve rightly pointed out that the federal government is good at making states, districts, and schools do something, but it 9s not good at making them do it well. Getting real results for students hinges on how that csomething is done. > > That 9s because when it comes to education 4 and any other issue in public life 4 those closest to the problem are always better able to solve it. Washington bureaucrats and self-styled education cexperts are about as far removed from students as you can get. > > Yet under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Washington overextended itself time and time again. > > Educators don 9t need engineering from Washington. Parents don 9t need prescriptions from Washington. Students don 9t need standards from Washington. > > Throughout both initiatives, the result was a further damaged classroom dynamic between teacher and student, as the focus shifted from comprehension to test-passing. This sadly has taken root, with the American Federation of Teachers recently finding that 60 percent of its teachers reported having moderate to no influence over the content and skills taught in their own classrooms. > > Let that sink in. Most teachers feel they have little 4 if any 4 say in their own classrooms. > > That statistic should shock even the most ardent sycophant of cthe system. It 9s yet another reason why we should shift power over classrooms from Washington back to teachers who know their students well. > > Federal mandates distort what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. > > Ideally, parent and teacher work together to help a child discover his or her potential and pursue his or her passions. When we seek to empower teachers, we must empower parents as well. Parents are too often powerless in deciding what 9s best for their child. The state mandates where to send their child. It mandates what their child learns and how he or she learns it. In the same way, educators are constrained by state mandates. District mandates. Building mandates . . . all kinds of other mandates! Educators don 9t need Washington mandating their teaching on top of everything else. > > But during the years covered in your volume, the focus was the opposite: more federal government intrusion into relationships between teachers, parents and children. > > The lessons of history should force us to admit that federal action has its limits. > > The federal-first approach did not start with No Child Left Behind. The push for higher national standards was present in the Clinton administration 9s cGoals 2000 initiative. Before that, we had President George H.W. Bush 9s cAmerica 2000, also calling for higher national standards. These followed the Reagan administration 9s cNation at Risk report, released in 1983. That report gave dire warnings about the country 9s track if education was not reformed. cIf an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, the report warned, cwe might well have viewed it as an act of war. That came after President Carter 9s giant nod to union bosses: the establishment of the Department of Education, with the ironic charge to cprohibit federal control of education. > > The trend is evident. Politicians from both parties just can 9t help themselves. They have talked about painting education in new colors and even broader strokes. But each time, reform has not fundamentally changed cthe system. Each attempt has really just been a new coat of paint on the same old wall. > > When we try the same thing over and over again, yet expect different results, that 9s not reform 3 that 9s insanity. > > We will not reach our goal of helping every child achieve his or her fullest potential until we truly change. Let me offer three ways we can move forward in that pursuit. > > First, we need to recognize that the federal government 9s appropriate role is not to be the nation 9s school board. My role is not to be the national superintendent nor the country 9s cchoice chief 4 regardless of what the union 9s cChicken Littles may say! Federal investments in education, after all, are less than 10 percent of total K-12 expenditures, but the burdens created by federal regulations in education amount to a much, much larger percentage. > > The Every Student Succeeds Act charted a path in a new direction. ESSA takes important steps to return power where it belongs by recognizing states 4 not Washington 4 should shape education policy around their own people. But state lawmakers should also resist the urge to centrally plan education. cLeave it to the states may be a compelling campaign-season slogan, but state capitols aren 9t exactly close to every family either. That 9s why states should empower teachers and parents and provide the same flexibility ESSA allows states. > > But let 9s recognize that many states are now struggling with what comes next. State ESSA plans aren 9t the finish line. Those words on paper mean very little if state and local leaders don 9t seize the opportunity to truly transform education. They must move past a mindset of compliance and embrace individual empowerment. > > Under ESSA, school leaders, educators and parents have the latitude and freedom to try new approaches to serve individual students. > > My message to them is simple: do it! > > Embrace the imperative to do something truly bold . . . to challenge the status quo . . . to break the mold. > > One important way to start this process is to make sure that parents get the information they want and need about the performance of their children 9s schools and teachers. ESSA encourages states to be transparent about how money is spent, down to the school-building level. > > Some states have developed information that is truly useful for parents and teachers. Others have worked just as hard to obfuscate what is really going on at their schools. To empower parents, policymakers and teachers, we can 9t let cthe system hide behind complexity to escape accountability. > > We must always push for better. > > ESSA is a good step in the right direction. But it 9s just that 4 a step. We still find ourselves boxed in a csystem, one where we are in a constant battle to move the ball between the 40-yard lines of a football field. Nobody scores, and nobody wins. Students are left bored in the bleachers, and many leave, never to return. > > So why don 9t we consider whether we need a new playbook? > > That brings me to point number two. And, to finish the analogy . . . let 9s call a new play: empowering parents. > > Parents have the greatest stake in the outcome of their child 9s education. Accordingly, they should also have the power to make sure their child is getting the right education. > > As Deven Carlson points out, there is little constituency in America for the top-down reforms that have been tried time and again. In order for any reform to truly work, it must attract and maintain the support of the people. > > I have seen such support for parental empowerment. The more parents exercise it, the more they like it. This growing support is why states are responding to that demand one by one. It 9s also why sycophants entrenched in and defending the status quo are terrified. They recoil from relinquishing power and control to teachers, parents and students. > > Well, I 9m not one bit afraid of losing power.

They deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. Every student deserves a customized, self-paced, and challenging life-long learning journey.

Freedom from cthe system. > > Choice in education is not when a student picks a different classroom in this building or that building, uses this voucher or that tax-credit scholarship. Choice in education is bigger than that. Those are just mechanisms. > > It 9s about freedom to learn. Freedom to learn differently. Freedom to explore. Freedom to fail, to learn from falling and to get back up and try again. It 9s freedom to find the best way to learn and grow . . . to find the exciting and engaging combination that unlocks individual potential. > > Which leads to my final point: if America 9s students are to be prepared, we must rethink school. > > What I propose is not another top-down, federal government policy that promises to be a silver bullet.

Or buy their way in? > > Why can 9t a student learn at his or her own pace? > > Why isn 9t technology more widely embraced in schools? > > Why do we limit what a student can learn based upon the faculty and facilities available? > > Why? > > We must answer these questions. We must acknowledge what is and what is not working for students. > > Now, I don 9t have all the answers or policy prescriptions. No one person does. But people do know how to help their neighbors. People do know how they can help a dozen students here or 100 there. Because they know the students. They know their home lives. They know their communities. They know their parents. They know each other. > > That means learning can, should, and will look different for each unique child. And we should celebrate that, not fear it! > > I 9m well aware that change 4 the unknown 4 can be scary. That talk of fundamentally rethinking our approach to education seems impossible, insurmountable. > > But not changing is scarier. Stagnation creates risks of its own. The reality is . . . we should be horrified of not changing. > > Our children don 9t fear their futures. Think of a newborn, born into hope 4 not fear. They begin life with a clean slate. With a fresh set of eyes to see things we don 9t currently see. That 9s how students begin their lifelong learning journeys . . . with unlimited potential . . . yet with limited time. > > Their dreams, their hopes, their aspirations, their futures can 9t wait, while another wave of lawmakers puts yet another coat of paint on the broken csystem. One year may not seem like much to an adult, but it 9s much too long for the child who still can 9t read cGoodnight Moon. > > We, the public, can 9t wait either. Education is good for the public. > > Everything else 4 our health, our economy, our continued security as a nation 4 depends on what we do today for the leaders of tomorrow. It follows, then, that any educator in any learning environment serves the public good.

What matters are their futures. We 9ve been entrusted with their futures not because we asked to be, but because it 9s a duty to destiny 3 theirs . . . and ours. It all depends on what we do now. > > When our grandchildren tell their children about this moment in history, let them say we were the ones who finally put students first. > > Thank you, and I look forward to this conversation.

            "article": " Dr. Arnold Gold, a pediatric neurologist whose belief in the importance of an empathetic bedside manner led him and his wife to create a foundation to inspire young doctors to practice compassionate patient care, died on Jan. 23 in Manhattan. He was 92. , His wife, Sandra Gold, confirmed his death. ,  cYou 9re only half a physician if you 9re just good at your craft, Dr. Gold said in an interview in 2016 for the Arnold P. Gold Foundation(http://www.gold-foundation.org/). cUnless it 9s coupled with patient-centered care and humanism, it 9s suboptimal care. , Dr. Gold, who treated patients and taught for more than 50 years at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons(http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/education/physicians_surgeons), part of Columbia University Medical Center, had a cheerful but authoritative demeanor. On rounds, he wanted to know about the life of the patient, not just his vital signs. He talked face to face with his young patients, often sitting on the floor and playing with them. ,  cHe enjoyed kids and he dealt with them in a wondrous way, Dr. David Mandelbaum, a former student of Dr. Gold 9s at Columbia who is a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the Brown University Alpert Medical School, said in a telephone interview. cHe always sensed what a kid was able to do, not what he couldn 9t do. , He was also concerned with the patients 9 parents, spending time, for example, to understand the effects that a neurologically damaged child 9s condition had on their marriage and finances. And if he could not give them hope, he gave them answers. ,  cHe told me the worst news in the most loving way, Amy Gleicher said in a telephone interview, recalling Dr. Gold 9s diagnosis concerning her year-old son, Max, in 1993. cHe told me my son was mentally retarded in such a way that I had dignity and my child had value. , Dr. Gold continued his humane approach as advances like M.R.I. 9s and CT scans revolutionized medicine. But he became distressed in the 1970s and 980s, he said, as he watched students and other doctors become too focused on technology and not enough on the people they were treating. ,  cSo one day in 1988, he said in the 2016 interview, cI was making rounds with the students and residents and a student presented me 8the brain tumor in 209. 9 And I said: 8The brain tumor? Isn 9t there a child involved in this? Tell me about the child, tell me about the family. Tell me how this is impacting on the family. Do you know any of this? 9 They did not, he said. , At home that night, he told his wife of his concerns about where medicine was headed. As he recalled, she told him, cYou know, Arnold, I 9m tired of you griping about medicine. _Do_ something about it or shut up. , They began the Arnold P. Gold Foundation together in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in 1988, hoping to clone Dr. Gold 9s humane approach to patient engagement. They started white-coat ceremonies at medical schools(http://www .gold-foundation.org/what-do-medical-students-hope-to-remember-about-their- white-coat-ceremony/) in which students pledge the Hippocratic oath in the early days of their education, rather than at graduation, as is common practice. Dr. Gold felt that graduation was too late to set expectations for the clinicians they would become. ,  cThis should be established at Day 1, he said in the interview. , Arnold Perlman Gold was born in Manhattan on Aug. 8, 1925. His father, Michael, a Jewish native of Dublin, and his mother, the former Rebecca Perlman, were lawyers. As a youngster, Arnold read cArrowsmith, Sinclair Lewis 9s 1925 novel about a doctor 9s search for truth. ,  cArnold was very idealistic and wanted to save the world, said Dr. Brian Benson, Dr. Gold 9s son-in-law, cand he was very impacted by that book. , In 1938, when Arnold was 13, his father died, and his mother sent him to live with an aunt in Galveston, Tex., believing that he might get a better chance at an education there. He attended the University of Texas, Austin, but left to serve stateside in World War II as a Navy corpsman. , He later graduated from the University of Texas, studied for a master 9s at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and earned his medical degree from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. , During his internship at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Dr. Gold tended to 30 children with polio who were in iron lungs. His mentor there, Dr. Margaret Smith, ctaught me a lot about patient-centered care, and she also led me into the field of pediatrics, he said in 2016. ,  cI was originally going to be an internist, an endocrinologist, he said. , When he was chief resident at Cincinnati Children 9s Hospital, part of his work placed him in Dr. Albert Sabin 9s laboratory while Dr. Sabin(http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0826.html \"His obituary.\") was developing the oral polio vaccine. While in Cincinnati, Dr. Gold rode horseback for the Frontier Nursing Service to treat people in rural Kentucky. , He returned to New York as visiting chief resident at the Babies Hospital(http://www.nyp.org/morganstanley/about-us/history) at the NewYork Presbyterian-Columbia University campus (now Morgan Stanley Children 9s Hospital) before beginning his long career at Columbia in child neurology. , Dr. Gold lived with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which affected his muscles later in his life and made it difficult for him to breathe. He treated patients until he was 88 and spoke at last year 9s white-coat ceremony at the(http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2017/08/14/ps-community-welcomes- class-2021-white-coat-ceremony/) College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia. , Besides his wife, the former Sandra Orenberg, who has a doctorate in counseling, he is survived by two daughters, Amelia Gold and Maggie Gold Seelig; a stepdaughter, Jennifer Arnold; a stepson, Stephen Silver; and 13 grandchildren. His stepson Jeffrey Silver died(http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/community-mourns-passing-of- pure-soul/) in 2010. , Dr. Gold recalled that in creating his foundation, his goal was to change the course of medical education. ,  cMy colleagues were very distressed, he recalled in the 2016 interview. cThey looked at me as sort of, 8What 9s happening to Arnold? 9 And one of them even said to me, 8I think you 9re smoking opium, 9 and, 8How could you ever believe that you can change medicine? 9 People were not very encouraging. , But 30 years later, the foundation said, more than 170 medical schools and physician assistant programs hold white-coat ceremonies annually. More than 260 nursing schools hold similar gatherings. , The foundation has also inducted 30,000 students, residents and faculty into its Gold Humanism Honor Society to recognize their compassionate patient care. The designation became prestigious enough for medical students to include it in applications for residencies. , Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, the president and chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said in an email that the honor society cdemonstrates that, increasingly, the medical profession recognizes humanistic attributes such as empathy and compassion as being every bit as important as academic achievement. , He added, cThis is just one more element of Dr. Gold 9s outstanding legacy.

The inspiring photo of Jahan Taab with her two-month-old was shared widely on social media. People were impressed by the 22-year-old's determination to continue the entrance exam despite her crying baby. Not wanting to abandon either, she decided to use the floor as a desk and cared for her baby at the same time.   Skip Twitter post by @ianbremmer  > Afghanistan.

England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed \\xa370m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities.    It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North.   * Is there a north-south divide in schools?(/news/education-38172816)   * Osborne urges action on north-south divide(/news/business-42893861)  The commissioner's research also finds:   * too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up   * more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good   * large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18   * there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities  Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. * * *  Teenagers' concerns Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. \"There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,\" said Hafsah. \"Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south.  !(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p062dkf7.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionHow Northern students see North-South education gap \"It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. \"It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. \"For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out. But it's not fair.\" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. \"A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. \"So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you.\" Qasim added: \"If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education.  Image caption Qasim says money plays a big part in opportunity  \"If you have more money, it does lead to more doors being opened for you. \"Some of us may have part-time jobs, but if your parents have a lot more money than other parents would do, then you won't have to get a part-time job so you can focus more on education, rather having a part-time job and having to pay for stuff.\" * * * Ms Longfield said that disadvantage manifested itself in childhood in many ways, including \"a lack of confidence, uncertainty and low expectation, isolated communities with narrow and poor job prospects, poor school results and poor connections to further and higher education\". She added: \"Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. \"There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. \"Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives.\"  Image copyrightOffice of the Children's CommissionerImage caption The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England  Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. \"The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do.\" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. \"We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. \"So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. \"Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. \"The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools.\"  'More to do' The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as \"Opportunity Areas\" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: \"We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. \"As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. \"Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes \\xa33.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, \\xa312m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home.\" The government has also committed \\xa370m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. \"By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England\"   ",

(Maria Danilova/AP) The Trump administration 9s 2019 budget proposal for the U.S. Education Department was just released, and it shows the continuing support that President Trump and Secretary Betsy DeVos have for expanding school choice, or alternatives to traditional public education. For the second year in a row, the administration has proposed slashing the department 9s budget while spending more than $1 billion on vouchers 4 which use public money for private and religious schools 4 and other choice programs. Congress may not approve the request, but it shows Trump 9s and DeVos 9s priorities. _ DeVos seeks cuts from Education Department to support school choice (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/devos-seeks- massive-cuts-from-education-department-to-support-school- choice/?utm_term=.2d61b70c2e0d)_ Charter schools and vouchers are well-known choice alternatives, but there are others that are less familiar, including what 9s called cEducation Savings Accounts, or ESAs. They may become more popular in states as the billionaire Koch brothers and their network plan to spend millions of dollars to push them and other efforts to privatize public education. ESAs are personal accounts created by a state for parents to use for a range of educational costs 4 including private school tuition and fees, as well as private tutoring 4 with state education funds. The trend in ESAs is that there is no means test, part of a larger shift in some parts of the school choice movement from advocating for choice being for low-income students to escape failing traditional public schools to choice being for all families. This is the vision that conservatives, such as the Kochs and DeVos and her longtime ally, former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), want to see become reality throughout the United States. Critics say that a publicly funded school system that is open to all students cannot function without stable budgets that would be disrupted by such a choice program. Here is a primer on ESAs written by Carol Burris, a former award-winning New York high school principal who is executive director of the Network for Public Education(https://networkforpubliceducation.org/), a nonprofit advocacy group. Burris was named the 2010 Educator of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State, and\\xa0in 2013, the National Association of Secondary School Principals named her the New York State High School Principal of the Year. Burris has been chronicling problems with modern school reform and school choice for years on this blog. She has previously written about problems with charter schools in California and a number of other states. _ What 8school choice 9 means in the era of Trump and DeVos (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/05/22/what-school- choice-means-in-the-era-of-trump-and-devos/?utm_term=.58cd4fa382c7)_ _**By Carol Burris**_ > _ cMy personal opinion is that the 12,000 or 13,000 government-run, unionized, politicized monopolies 4 we call them school districts 4 is not the best governance model for the world we 9re moving towards. 4 Jeb Bush_ The above definition of a public school district was given by former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) at a recent panel on Education Savings Accounts(http://www.aei.org/events/education-savings-accounts-jeb-bush-on- the-future-of-educational-choice-2/) at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. At the event, Bush, who was a pioneer in the education reform movement that relied on high-stakes standardized tests for evaluation purposes and on the Common Core State Standards, argued that states should give parents tax dollars on a debit card to buy customized education services as an alternative to public schools. The marketplace would be in charge. Parents, he said, would be cthe regulators. Welcome to the world of Education Savings Accounts, often referred to as ESAs. If you are not familiar with Education Savings Accounts, you should be. During a recent three-day seminar in Indian Wells, Calif.,(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/?utm_term=.ad7c0c96ef50) hosted by the billionaire Koch brothers, ESAs were announced as one of their identified legislative priorities of 2018. And they have already gotten started. The Koch 9s 501(c)4, Americans for Prosperity, is pouring millions into an effort to defeat a November ballot referendum to overturn the expansion of ESAs in Arizona. _ The Daily 202: Koch network laying groundwork to fundamentally transform America 9s education system (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/)_ Last year, the Arizona legislature narrowly passed a bill making ESAs eventually available to all K-12 students in the state\\xa0 4 despite reports(https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona- education/2017/01/31/arizona-school-vouchers-expansion-audit/97163702/)\\xa0of lax oversight and fraudulent spending in the state 9s small existing program. Following the passage of the bill, a scrappy group of parents and teachers came together to form Save Our Schools Arizona(https://sosarizona.org/), gathering enough signatures to put ESAs up for a public vote. The Kochs have fought to shut down the referendum in the courts and on the airwaves ever since. Of all the various school privatization programs, Educational Savings Accounts are the most market-based and the least accountable. What they ultimately do is reduce society 9s obligation to educate our nation 9s youth to the dropping of tax dollars onto a debit card. There are six states with ESA programs: Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Nevada. Nevada 9s program is nonoperational and unfunded. In a seventh state, New Hampshire, ESAs are likely to be approved this year. Last year, more than 20 state legislatures introduced ESA bills, with the proposed programs nearly always going by a different name. For example, ESAs are called Gardiner Scholarships in Florida, Individualized Education Accounts in Tennessee and Empowerment Scholarship Accounts in Arizona. Despite the different names, intended to hide the joint effort by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful conservative organization, to promote the same basic bill, they operate in similar ways. _ This ALEC state report card speaks volumes about Betsy DeVos 9s education agenda (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/08/13/this-alec-state-report-card-speaks-volumes-about-betsy- devoss-education-agenda/?utm_term=.c059f6c08804)_ Parents pledge not to enroll their son or daughter in a public school or a charter school. In exchange, they get nearly all of what the school would have spent (usually 90 percent) placed on a debit card or in an account. The remaining 10 percent is used to fund program administration. Parents can use the money for private or religious school tuition, online learning, books, hippotherapy (horseback riding for therapeutic purposes) and home schooling 4 or they can choose to spend minimal dollars on K-12 education and save for college. There is no obligation that the curriculum that is used to teach students who use ESAs to attend private schools be developmentally appropriate, challenging or even accurate. Although a few states require parents to promise that their children receive instruction in reading, grammar, mathematics, science and social studies, what content is taught and what is learned is immaterial. If at this point you are thinking that most taxpayers would view such an unaccountable and unregulated system as one in which families could easily be victimized by misinformation, false claims, profiteering and fraud, you would be right. This is not lost on the proponents of ESAs. That is why they have developed all kinds of language to make ESAs seem hip and cutting-edge, when they are really advocating a return to a time before the 1830s when schooling was a haphazard event for all but the wealthy. **The Language of the cCustomizers d** The AEI panel that Bush introduced provided insight into how proponents cmarket ESAs. Lindsey Burke of the Heritage Foundation(https://www.heritage.org/) referred to many ESA parents as ccustomizers who buy ca la carte education with their debit card. According to Burke, 20 percent of all Florida ESA students never set foot in a bricks-and-mortar school, which she enthusiastically embraced as success. Adam Peshek of Bush 9s Foundation for Excellence in Education(https://www.excelined.org/) proposed that individual teachers go into business for themselves by recruiting students for their cmicro schools. He suggested that they could charge students $100 a session to attend. ESAs, he said, will lead to the cnext generation of accountability modeled after Yelp and Urbanspoon. Peshek views ESAs as a gamble in innovation, saying that ESAs allow cyou to make small bets in education where if it works, great. And cif it doesn 9t work, no problem, because you 9re making small bets and you 9re adjusting in real time. But there is a problem he didn 9t mention. Those csmall bets are made at kids 9 expense. Panelist Jonathan Beckam of Step Up for Students(https://www.stepupforstudents.org/) described how his organization, with the help of ctwo big companies, created cthe largest online marketplace for ESAs. Here is how he described his work: > cSo from a family 9s perspective, it 9s really like an Amazon shopping experience. I can log on to this private marketplace. I can see thousands of products and services that are preapproved for acceptable use for my program. I can click into those products and get detailed product information and availability for it. I can add it to my shopping cart and check out using my ESA funds directly. When the panel was over, it was time for questions. An earnest young man from the University of Georgia asked the following: > cThe University of Georgia is in one of the poorest counties in the state of Georgia: Adams Clark County. A bunch of parents are working two, three jobs to help their children get by and to, you know, possibly save up so their children can get a better life than they did. My question for you is: With all of these programs, with this $21,000 you were talking about, how do you work with giving the parents the time to get as involved as we would want them to be? How would we 4 how do you work with giving the parents the time as well as that money? The host responded: cI will hold off that. Thank you for that one, and we 9ll take a question here. All of the talk of customization, a la carte services and the glorification of choice, is designed to entice parents to support what many people see as an unsustainable and irresponsible system were it to become widescale. ESAs are a mechanism to change the way we fund education by assigning each child a backpack full of cash. How much is in the backpack would be determined by the state. Over time, if parents want more than some basic educational services, they would need to kick in money themselves. It is the Chilean model. As money is drained from school districts, services go down, resulting in more students exiting with their funding, leaving still less for those who remain. Beth Lewis, one of the co-founders of SOS Arizona, knows exactly what happens over time when school choice becomes the means to undermine public education.  cIn the past two decades in Arizona, we 9ve seen millions of public dollars diverted to private schools through ESA vouchers and other programs, she said. cIn this same time period, our state leaders have strategically divested in our public schools, driving us down to 49th in the nation in teacher pay and per-student spending. Arizona is a cautionary tale of what can (and will) go wrong with the privatization of our public schools. And there is no reason to believe that the Koch brothers and other right-wing libertarians such as the DeVos family will stop with public schools. As Texan Stacy Hock told The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/01/30/daily-202 -koch-network-laying-groundwork-to-fundamentally-transform-america-s -education-system/5a6feb8530fb041c3c7d74db/?utm_term=.e81227228508)at the Kochs 9 Indian Wells soiree, K-12 education is on the agenda because it is the clowest-hanging fruit for policy change in the United States. Easy pickings may not be final pickings for those who want to commercialize every aspect of America 9s public services.  ",

            "article": "  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deployed a new weapon at the Olympics to fight back against the Trump administration 9s sanctions and threats of a preemptive strike against his nuclear program: His sister. Kim Yo Jong shook hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, cheered enthusiastically for a unified Korean team, and displayed a sense of humor in weekend meetings. She also delivered a letter inviting(https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-02-10/kim-jong-un- invites-south-korea-s-moon-to-summit-in-pyongyang \"Kim Summit Invitation to South Korea May Ease Peninsula Tensions\") Moon to a summit with her brother in Pyongyang, and asked him to play a cleading role in reuniting the two Koreas after nearly seven decades.  cI never expected to come here on such short notice to be honest, and I thought it would be strange and different but it 9s not, Kim Yo Jong said at a dinner Sunday night before heading home. cThere are many things similar and the same. I hope we can quickly become one and meet these good people again in Pyongyang.     The warm words were aimed at further exploiting divisions between the U.S. and South Korea, which differ on the best way to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. Her visit amounted to a charm offensive designed to counter the U.S. narrative that Kim Jong Un is a madman who tortures his own people and would blow up Los Angeles or New York City if he didn 9t get his way. North Korea 9s participation in the Olympics has already allowed Kim Jong Un to undermine President Donald Trump 9s pressure campaign, with some sanctions suspended temporarily until the event ends. In pushing for a summit with Moon, Kim is seeking to consolidate those gains while maintaining his nuclear arsenal to deter a U.S. invasion. The question now is whether the U.S. and South Korea can stay united in keeping up the pressure on North Korea just as sanctions limiting export revenue and curbing fuel imports start to bite. While Trump 9s advisers have threatened military action to prevent Kim from gaining the ability to strike the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon, Moon is seeking to prevent a war that could devastate South Korea and the region. Kim 9s proposal for a summit was ca brilliant diplomatic maneuver, said Andrei Lankov, a historian at Kookmin University in Seoul who once studied in Pyongyang. Moon would irritate Trump if he accepts the invitation, while declining would make the U.S. and South Korea appear cunreasonably bellicose, he said. How North Korea Managed to Crash the Olympics Party(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/the-koreas-get-in- the-olympic-spirit-for-now \"Click for full story\")      cThe proposal, as well as North Korea 9s presence at the Games, sends a signal that the North Koreans are ready to talk, Lankov said. cAnd this signal helps the opponents of a military operation in Washington and elsewhere. Signs of discord in the U.S.-South Korea alliance were evident immediately after the announcement. Moon 9s office initially provided conflicting accounts of whether he accepted the invitation, with a Blue House spokesperson later clarifying that pre-conditions first needed to be met. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence didn 9t discuss the invitation with Moon Saturday while they watched a speed-skating event, a senior White House official said. Speaking to reporters later, Pence reiterated that there was cno daylight between the U.S., South Korea and Japan in pushing to isolate North Korea until Kim abandons his nuclear program.  Pence Talks Later on, Pence told the Washington Post that the U.S. is ready to engage in talks about North Korea 9s nuclear program even as it maintains pressure on Kim 9s regime. In the interview, he said Moon assured him that the North Koreans wouldn 9t get economic or diplomatic benefits for just talking 4 only for taking concrete steps toward denuclearization. Moon came to power promising a softer approach to Pyongyang and has repeatedly sought a summit with Kim Jong Un. Moon initially opposed U.S. plans to deploy a missile shield in South Korea, and last year vowed to prevent war at all costs after Trump threatened cfire and fury against North Korea. Moon faces the risk of a backlash at home if he goes too far. His approval ratings, while still high at 63 percent, fell after he pushed for a unified women 9s ice hockey team for the two Koreas. Conservative groups have protested the appearance of North Korean athletes at the Games in Pyeongchang with vulgar signs.  8Wild Dream 9 South Korea 9s Unification Ministry said Monday that the dialogue would be led by the two Koreas with cooperation and support from international partners. South Korea cwill faithfully implement the international sanctions on North Korea, while also adhering to the principle of resolution through peaceful means, it said. North Korea has shown no signs it 9s willing to discuss denuclearization. Its negotiators protested last month when South Koreans raised the issue during talks over the Olympics, a line North Korea 9s state-run media has reiterated. Last week, a commentary published by the Korean Central News Agency called denuclearization ca wild dream that can never come true. Moon won 9t have much space to negotiate with North Korea without backing from the U.S.,\\xa0said Christopher Green, senior adviser on the Korean peninsula at the International Crisis Group in Amsterdam.  cHis goal is to do enough on the inter-Korean front to get the United States and North Korea to jaw-jaw, Green said. cThe real strategic games have only just begun.  _ 4 With assistance by Sohee Kim, and Toluse Olorunnipa_   ",

The court of public opinion was slow to grant validity, eventually yielding only to numbers tabulated in headstones. But in the post-MeToo era, it seems the tide has changed. Anecdotes are sufficient; formal due process is perhaps optional. Deaf ears are now empathetic, and unwilling to entertain the notion that misconduct could ever be \"justifiable.\" What matters is listening to ensure that no one else will find their loved one's name next to a hashtag. Find it ironic? Me too. !Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180110130620-02-catherine-deneuve- file-large-169.jpg)(/2018/01/10/opinions/le-monde-letter-catherine-deneuve- perez-opinion/index.html) Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of MeToo(/2018/01/10/opinions/le-monde-letter-catherine-deneuve-perez- opinion/index.html) But Justice Ginsburg's revelation was hardly intended to identify a powerful irony. It was intended to acknowledge the powerful force of momentum. The Supreme Court hears but a lean fraction of cases seeking its review. Among the factors (https://www.supremecourt.gov/filingandrules/2017RulesoftheCourt.pdf)it considers is the divisiveness of the issue presented, the impact of the court's holding on the nation, and whether the conduct at issue offends our collective constitutional principles. But as landmark civil rights cases like Brown v. Board of Education or Lawrence v. Texas demonstrate, momentum has a way of catapulting an issue to the front of the figurative queue. But sometimes momentum yields unfortunate results. Before invalidating a key provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get pre-authorization from the Department of Justice before making any changes to its voting laws, for instance, Chief Justice John Roberts implied(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/holder-v-roberts) the election of black men and women to political office placed us in a post-racial world that no longer required this kind of government oversight. Ginsburg correctly dissented, arguing instead that such protections were necessary in spite of perceptions of progress. She, like others who have experienced discrimination, understood that pruning the tree of oppression doesn't destroy its roots. Milestones, no matter how significant, should neither be blindly touted nor used as an excuse to call off the watchdogs. It should shock and offend you that a nation this old should still be patted on the back for taking its first steps. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the MeToo movement seems to prompt such visceral reactions. People believed that we were in a post-gender world. We're not. People are surprised to learn that democratic principles of equality remain aspirational, and elude huge segments of our population. Even 45 years after the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade, the right of women to exercise autonomy over their bodies remains vulnerable to political attack. The litmus test for whether you believe in equality is not whether one wears a pin; it is whether you understand that equality is the linchpin of a democratic society. Are you surprised that people still don't understand that? Me too.  ",

If successful, this regressive law (https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hr-620-could-put-disability-rights-at- risk)would significantly hinder a person with a disability's right to file a lawsuit for violations of access. It would require creating a written claim with specific legal requirements to document the violation (which would be onerous for an attorney, let alone your average John Q. Public with little experience with accessibility requirements and measurements). Businesses would then have 60 days to respond and an additional 120 days make \"substantial progress(https://www.defendingourfuture.org/hr-620-ada-education-and-reform- act/)\" -- a term still undefined. In practice, business owners could spend decades failing to comply with the accessibility requirements of the ADA as long as they claim to be attempting substantial progress. This attempt to undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities is happening largely in response to several stories claiming that there is a growing army of disabled people cruising the streets, looking for potential lawsuits wherever they go, and are getting rich off of the spoils. The reality, of course, is that the only thing that can be collected in ADA lawsuits are attorney's fees, so no disabled person who brings charges can actually get monetary damages from a lawsuit. All they can achieve is the business remedying its inaccessibility. !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley-family-1-large-169.jpg) !A disabled, biracial, \\(and totally normal\\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley- family-1-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family 04:42 Furthermore, in cases where it's assumed that there are hundreds of lawyers repeatedly filing case after case to the point of appearing fraudulent, the Center for American Progress (where I am a senior fellow) has traced the number of attorneys doing so to only 12 lawyers, and there are disciplinary actions available to take action against them in state bar associations or district courts. A federal law -- especially one that would harm more than help -- is hardly necessary here. There is a significant countermovement against this legislation, comprised of a mix of social media (with groups like Crip the Vote and others using HandsOffMyADA), traditional civil disobedience by ADAPT(http://adapt.org/) and others, visits to legislators and phone banking by older disability organizations like the ARC and the Autism Society. These organizations are also working with groups like Little Lobbyists (https://www.littlelobbyists.org/)and other parent/family organizations who organized last year to protect Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. For those of us who are parents and working in the disability justice space, these alliances are proving to be interesting examples of not having to choose one group or the other. As someone who was 10 years old when the ADA became law, I have little memory of life before it, beyond what I've heard from my parents and elders in the community. The notion that I will need to start thinking about life without the ADA or with extremely limited access, paired with additional bureaucratic measures required to access public spaces, feels like I forgot to turn off Netflix before bed and an especially dark episode of \"Black Mirror\" is still playing in the background. This shouldn't be our reality.

'Brainwashing' process Kanat and other human rights advocates describe, citing sources on the ground, how people supposedly prone to influences of Islamic extremism undergo a \"brainwashing\" process inside the detention camps -- often housed in converted schools or government buildings. Detainees are required to praise the ruling Communist Party, sing revolutionary songs, learn to speak Mandarin, study the thought of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and confess perceived transgressions such as praying at a mosque or traveling abroad, according to activists. \"It's completely unlawful -- the authorities provide no legal documentation to the families and there are no time limits (on the length of detention),\" said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, which published a detailed report on the subject last September and called on Beijing to free all detainees. !Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180201130146-xinjiang-anti-terror- propaganda-posters-large-169.jpg) Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014. \"There's a lot of fear, with people losing contact with loved ones.\" Xinjiang authorities have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for information on the political education camps and response to activists' allegations, but state media outlets have covered these facilities and touted their effectiveness in de-radicalizing the locals.

Ubiquitous surveillance Activists say the regional government, now led by a hardline Xi loyalist, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs but also increasingly relied on high-tech tools to keep the population in check. They cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65. The authorities also enacted a sweeping anti-extremism law last year, with long beards, veils in public and home-schooling all on the ban list,(https://cnn.com/2017/03/31/asia/china-xinjiang-new-rules/index.html) prompting new denunciations from international human rights groups. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment as well as curtailed religious freedom in their homeland.

Over the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, has also fueled ethnic tensions, despite the government's best effort to paint a picture of ethnic harmony. \"We guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnicities and prohibit the discrimination and oppression against any ethnic groups,\" Zhang Yijiong, a senior Communist Party official in charge ethnic minority affairs, told reporters last October. \"The cultures, histories, languages and traditions of all ethnicities are protected and respected by national laws.\" Critics of Beijing's Uyghur policy see a starkly different scenario in Xinjiang, as the authorities intensify their crackdown and forced political indoctrination spreads. \"These campaigns are purportedly about counter-extremism and counterterrorism, but ... it's really about surveillance, control and assimilation,\" said Wang, the Human Rights Watch researcher. \"The real intention of the Chinese government is to eliminate the Uyghurs as a distinct ethnic group,\" Rebiya Kadeer, a longtime exiled Uyghur leader who recently stepped down as president of the World Uyghur Congress, told CNN in an interview in Washington last year. \"Religious suppression, cultural restrictions, Uyghur language ban -- all this repression in Xinjiang only makes the Uyghurs hold on to their identity more firmly,\" she added. \"China has awakened the Uyghur people.\"  ",

Mr. Carranza faces an additional set of challenges. He is new to New York and has never worked in the system, unlike his predecessor, Carmen Fari\\xf1a, who spent 52 years in the city 9s schools. His new boss, Bill de Blasio, is a second-term mayor with likely ambitions for higher office and a reputation as a micromanager. , At the news conference where his appointment was announced, Mr. Carranza declared that there was cno daylight between himself and the mayor, which makes it hard to know how much he will set a new course for the school system or push on issues, like segregation, that the administration has soft- pedaled. , Mr. Carranza comes to New York by way of Houston where he had a short stint as superintendent. Before that, he worked in San Francisco, Clark County, Nev., and Tucson, where he grew up. As he steps into his new position, here are some of the biggest issues he will face. , A 2014 report (https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration- and-diversity/ny-norflet-report-placeholder \"The report\")found that New York City has one of the most segregated school systems in the country. Nearly 70 percent of students are black and Latino, and they overwhelmingly go to school in racially isolated classrooms, with few white and Asian children. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Fari\\xf1a have repeatedly blamed the city 9s segregated neighborhoods and have suggested there is little they can do. Even after facing intense public pressure, they have taken only modest steps, such as setting aside seats in some schools for low-income students. When the mayor released what had been billed as a cbigger vision d(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/nyregion/mayor-bill-de- blasio-new-york-public-schools-diversity-plan.html \"Times coverage\") for integrating schools, he resisted even using the word csegregated. , A high-profile example of the problem is the lack of black and Latino students at the eight specialized high schools where admission is decided by a single test. This spring, only 10 percent of offers(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/nyregion/admissions-specialized- high-schools-new-york.html) at these schools went to black and Latino students. When Mr. de Blasio was running for mayor in 2013, he pledged to diversify these schools, but more recently he has suggested(https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/newsletters/politico-new- york-education/2018/03/12/de-blasio-on-specialized-high-school-diversity- crisis-043202) that his hands are tied and that any change must come from the state. , Mr. de Blasio came into office pledging to lift up low-performing schools, rather than close them, as his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had done. But his $582 million Renewal initiative, which flooded 94 schools with resources while subjecting them to sometimes contradictory directives, has produced disappointing results(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/nyregion /new-york-city-will-close-or-merge-19-schools-most-from-renewal-program.html). This year, the city proposed closing eight of the schools 4 the largest number it had ever closed in one year 4 drawing protests from parents and elected officials. , Mr. Carranza will have to decide whether to continue the initiative, whose future looks cloudy; the official who led the effort was recently moved aside, and no successor has been named. Fifty schools are expected to remain in the program next year. Another challenge: The city 9s Education Department has said that, to replace some of the schools it is closing, it will open eight new schools in the fall, something that this administration has little experience doing. , Though the city has made real progress on increasing overall graduation rates, the academic divides between different groups of students are yawning. Citywide, the graduation rate last year was 87.5 percent for Asian students and 83.2 percent for white students. For black students, the rate was 70 percent and for Hispanic students, 68.3 percent. Just 32.5 percent of students still learning English graduated. , Even within the same school, black and Hispanic students and those who live in poverty can fall behind their peers. A study(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/nyregion/study-black-white- achievement-gap-schools.html) from the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School looked at student performance for third through fifth graders on the 2016 state math exam, and it found the poorer the students, the lower their scores tended to be on the test, even if they attended school with wealthy children. , The issue is far from unique to New York. In San Francisco, Mr. Carranza faced a similar gap: African-American children there have long scored among the lowest in California on standardized tests. cIt 9s fair to say that like all the superintendents before him he was not able to find the magic formula, said Norman Yee, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco and a former president of the city 9s Board of Education. , In San Francisco, where Mr. Carranza spent his longest-tenure as a superintendent, he oversaw about 55,000 children. In New York, double that number 4 more than 111,500 students 4 were homeless at some point during the 2016-17 school year. That is 10 percent of the city 9s public school population. , Those homeless students include anyone in a temporary living situation, which could include children living in a car or a hotel or staying on the sofa at a friend 9s house. , In addition to the emotional toll, the academic effects of homelessness can be severe. Homeless students are chronically absent at far higher rates than other children, are more likely to drop out than their peers and less likely to graduate or to test on grade level. Even after finding housing, the Education Trust-New York found that formerly homeless children continue to struggle academically(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/nyregion/homeless- students-school-new-york.html) for years. , Following through on a campaign promise, Mr. de Blasio in his first term created a public prekindergarten seat for every 4-year-old in the city. He is now planning to go further, creating thousands of seats for 3-year-olds in what he is calling c3-K. But while the prekindergarten initiative has been popular among parents, it has caused problems(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/nyregion/free-preschool-deblasio- new-york-city.html) for the previously existing system that provides free or subsidized child care and early education to low-income families. , Home-based child care providers have lost income and stand to lose more as 3-K is rolled out. So-called EarlyLearn centers, which serve infants to 5-year- olds 4 and, unlike prekindergarten classes in public schools, are open 10 hours a day and do not close for school vacations 4 are struggling to retain teachers, because teachers in public schools can make as much as $30,000 more per year. Many centers have had to close classrooms because they cannot find teachers to oversee them. , Directors of these programs have begged the city to address the salary disparity, which they say has drawn experienced teachers away from classrooms serving low-income children 4 who need those teachers the most 4 to classrooms serving higher-income children. ,  cThe narrative out of City Hall is that the signature initiative is early childhood education, and how that has helped low-income families, said David Nocenti, the executive director of Union Settlement, which serves roughly 350 children in centers in East Harlem. cThe reality is quite different. , About 200,000 New York City public school children are identified as having a disability, which can range from mild learning differences to severe challenges. , Spending on special education has increased under the de Blasio administration, while results for these students remain poor. The graduation rate among students with disabilities last year was just 46.7 percent, and the enormous system that serves them is riddled with problems. According to an annual report that the Education Department makes to the City Council, 48,000(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/nyregion/special-education-nyc- schools.html) students during the last school year received only some of the services they needed, or none at all. , Highlighting an additional area of vast shortcomings, the city 9s public advocate, Letitia James, found(https://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/sites/advocate.nyc.gov/files/denial_of_service_report_7717_1.pdf) that in the 2015-16 school year nearly half of the 9,000 issued vouchers, which allow students to receive services their schools cannot provide, went unused, in part because there were too few therapists in certain parts of the city. The Special Education Student Information System, the electronic platform that tracks student needs and services, is also riddled(https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/05/09/new-york-citys- special-ed-tracking-system-malfunctioned-more-than-800000-times-per-day-but- changes-are-underway/) with problems that, for example, lead it to provide incomplete information about whether students are receiving the services they need. , Mr. de Blasio ran for office criticizing charter schools and promising to halt the practice of giving them space in public school buildings, but he soon got a lesson(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/nyregion/cuomo-put-his-weight- behind-charter-school-protections.html) in the danger of going head-to-head with their wealthy supporters. In 2014, the year that Mr. de Blasio took office, a pro-charter group spent $9.6 million on lobbying(https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/nyregion/groups-that-back- bloombergs-education-agenda-enjoy-success-in-albany.html), more than any other organization in the state, much of it on advertisements attacking him. , Since then his administration has at times struggled to navigate its relationship with the city 9s 227 charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated and serve roughly 10 percent of the city 9s public school students. Perhaps the biggest challenge in the coming years will be finding space for new or expanding charter schools. Under legislation passed in 2014, the city must provide space for these schools or be responsible for at least part of their rent. But nearly every decision to place a charter school inside a school building is controversial, requiring other schools to squeeze into less space. , Ms. Fari\\xf1a has at times been disparaging of charters, and charter leaders are hoping that Mr. Carranza 9s arrival will be an opportunity for a reset. James Merriman, the chief executive officer of the New York City Charter School Center, said he hoped Mr. Carranza would embrace charter schools as partners. He suggested that Mr. Carranza could ask charter leaders to start schools specifically aimed at serving homeless students, for instance, or, with a change in state law, ask a high-performing charter to take over an elementary school zone and enroll all students in the zone rather than admit students through a lottery. ,  cIf he 9s willing to meet the sector at that level and see us as full partners, he 9ll find people on the other side, and together with philanthropy, we could do some interesting things, Mr. Merriman said.

            "article": " Facial recognition technology is improving by leaps and bounds. Some commercial software can now tell the gender of a person in a photograph. , When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time. , But the darker the skin, the more errors arise 4 up to nearly 35 percent for images of darker skinned women, according to a new study that breaks fresh ground by measuring how the technology works on people of different races and gender. , These disparate results, calculated by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, show how some of the biases in the real world can seep into artificial intelligence, the computer systems that inform facial recognition. , In modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women. , One widely used facial-recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white, according to another research study. , The new study also raises broader questions of fairness and accountability in artificial intelligence at a time when investment in and adoption of the technology is racing ahead. , Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending. , Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults(https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement 4 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases. , Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far. ,  cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail 4 to make them socially accountable, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah. , Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, Google had to apologize(https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/google- photos-mistakenly-labels-black-people-gorillas/) after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as cgorillas. , Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini 9s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations. ,  cBut this is the first work I 9m aware of that shows that empirically, Ms. Friedler said. , Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long. , But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face. , By then, face recognition software was increasingly moving out of the lab and into the mainstream. ,  cO.K., this is serious, she recalled deciding then. cTime to do something. , So she turned her attention to fighting the bias built into digital technology. Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of calgorithmic accountability, which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair. , Her short TED Talk(https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms) on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the Algorithmic Justice League(https://www.ajlunited.org/), a project to raise awareness of the issue. , In her newly published paper(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf), which will be presented at a conference(https://fatconference.org/) this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems 4 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China 4 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software 4 and their code was publicly available for testing. , She found them all wanting. , To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark- skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents. , The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race. , Then, each company 9s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft 9s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM 9s and Megvii 9s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males. , Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was cdeeply committed to cunbiased and ctransparent services. This month, the company said, it will roll out an improved service with a nearly 10-fold increase in accuracy on darker-skinned women. , Microsoft said that it had calready taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology and that it was investing in research cto recognize, understand and remove bias. , Ms. Buolamwini 9s co-author on her paper is Timnit Gebru, who described her role as an adviser. Ms. Gebru is a scientist at Microsoft Research, working on its Fairness Accountability Transparency and Ethics in A.I. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/fate/)group. , Megvii, whose Face++ software is widely used for identification in online payment and ride-sharing services in China, did not reply to several requests for comment, Ms. Buolamwini said. , Ms. Buolamwini is releasing her data set for others to build upon. She describes her research as ca starting point, very much a first step toward solutions. , Ms. Buolamwini is taking further steps in the technical community and beyond. She is working with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(https://www.ieee.org/index.html), a large professional organization in computing, to set up a group to create standards for accountability and transparency in facial analysis software. , She meets regularly with other academics, public policy groups and philanthropies that are concerned about the impact of artificial intelligence. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation(https://www.fordfoundation.org/), said that the new technology could be a cplatform for opportunity, but that it would not happen if it replicated and amplified bias and discrimination of the past. ,  cThere is a battle going on for fairness, inclusion and justice in the digital world, Mr. Walker said. , Part of the challenge, scientists say, is that there is so little diversity within the A.I. community.  ,  cWe 9d have a lot more introspection and accountability in the field of A.I. if we had more people like Joy, said Cathy O 9Neil, a data scientist and author of cWeapons of Math Destruction. , Technology, Ms. Buolamwini said, should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it 9s used on. ,  cYou can 9t have ethical A.I. that 9s not inclusive, she said. cAnd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards.

Hawaii has been testing alert capabilities, and the employee for the state Emergency Management Agency mistook a drill for a real warning about a missile threat.

Hawai\\u02bbi Emergency Management Agency \"There were no procedures in place to prevent a single person from mistakenly sending a missile alert\" in Hawaii, said James Wiley, a cybersecurity and communications reliability staffer at the FCC. There was no requirement to double-check with a colleague or get a supervisor's approval, he said.\\xa0 In addition, software at Hawaii's emergency agency used the same prompts for both test and actual alerts, and it generally used prepared text that made it easy for a staffer to click through the alerting process without focusing enough on the text of the warning that would be sent.\\xa0 The worker, whose name has not been released, has refused to talk to the FCC, but federal regulators got information from his written statement that state officials provided.\\xa0 The alert was sent to cellphones, TV and radio stations in Hawaii on the morning of Jan. 13, leading people to fear the state was under nuclear attack. \"THIS IS NOT A DRILL,\" it said.

During their conversation, Miyagi explained cellphone users weren't told about the error sooner because his agency didn't have procedures for issuing corrections. That has since changed 4 and two people will now be required to send out alerts in the future.\\xa0 The FCC said the state Emergency Management Agency has already taken steps to try to avoid a repeat of the false alert, requiring more supervision of drills and alert and test-alert transmissions. It has created a correction template for false alerts and has stopped ballistic missile defense drills until its own investigation is done. According to the FCC inquiry, the recorded message used for the drill began by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" -- the script for a drill, the FCC said. Then the recording used language that is typically used for a real threat, not a drill: \"this is not a drill.\" The recording ended by saying \"exercise, exercise, exercise.\" However, the worker on duty did not hear the \"exercise, exercise, exercise\" part of the message and believed the threat was real, according to the employee's statement. The worker responded by sending the alert.   ",

To build a website I needed a computer, but no one in my family could afford one. Luckily, my relative gave me a Nokia 2690 phone. It wasn't very advanced, but adequate enough for me to learn the language of programming.

I was inspired by Mark Zuckerberg. But I wanted to go further and create something better. At that time Facebook was set up to connect people you already knew, but I wanted to create a platform which connected everybody. After some time and a lot of effort, my attempt to replace Facebook fell through. I couldn't get enough users to sign up on the website. The few that signed up didn't stick around because there was only a few people to chat with.  A new idea, a new app !The dot Learn team.

I quickly moved onto my next idea: an app that makes it easy to send text messages to multiple people at once and at an affordable price. The cost of sending text messages in Nigeria was around $0.013, I planned on reducing it to $0.005. To build the app, I learned a new programming language called Java. I also needed to have a computer to compile the code, but I still couldn't afford one. Fortunately, I was able to find a way to build an app right on my Nokia phone, through an application called J2ME SDK Mobile(http://elvischidera.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/create-j2me-apps-with-your- mobile-phone.html). I spent days programming, carefully typing everything on the phone's small number pad.

It was becoming clear that to take my programming skills to the next level I would need a computer. I cut my daily expenses and lived a simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop. Still, it wasn't enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job building a website to earn the remaining sum.

I switched immediately to creating Android apps. The Android platform didn't have the limitations that exist on the J2ME platform which, for a techie like me, was very exciting. At this point, I was now a high school graduate, and I was looking for freelance jobs to support my family. I saw a job advert for an Android developer position at dot Learn. I looked them up and realized it was set up by two MIT-based technologists working in a field that I was passionate about, education technology. !African &39;smart cities:&39; the future of the continent?(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!African &39;smart cities:&39; the future of the continent?(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130318100618-hope-city-1-story- top.jpg)(/2017/12/12/africa/africa-new-smart-cities/index.html) African 'smart cities:' the future of the continent?(/2017/12/12/africa /africa-new-smart-cities/index.html) They had a unique idea: to solve the problem of access to online education by making educational videos extremely data-light\\u200a -- \\u200aas low as 1MB for every hour of video. I felt this was key to making education more accessible, as cheap and fast internet connection needed to download large videos is still uncommon in Africa. I am very passionate about revolutionizing education in Africa. In fact, I had already built a free (ad-supported) exam prep app called PrepUp(http://techcabal.com/2015/12/18/this-app-makes-exam-prep-sessions- look-like-a-day-in-the-game-truck/) with over 30,000+ installs and was one of the finalists at the West Africa Mobile Awards 2016(https://techpoint.ng/2016/03/24/west-africa-mobile- awards-2016-finalists/). !This West African lab made a 3D printer from toxic e-waste(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!This West African lab made a 3D printer from toxic e-waste(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171101142626-3d-printer- togo-04-large-169.jpg)(/2017/11/28/africa/3d-printer-electronic- waste/index.html) This West African lab made a 3D printer from toxic e-waste(/2017/11/28/africa/3d-printer-electronic-waste/index.html) After several days of debating with myself, I finally applied for the position. Well, long story short: after lots of preparation, a phone interview, coding projects, and answering challenging questions, I was accepted. Working at dot Learn, I have met lots of awesome people from MIT, Harvard, and other great places. As a team, we have been part of some testing competitions like the Techcrunch Battlefield Africa(https://techcrunch.com/video/dot- learn-startup-battlefield-africa-2017/59df0c729e45105de569e2c1/), Cisco Innovation Challenge(https://blogs.cisco.com/news/the-price-of-knowledge-dot- learn), and the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge(https://www.mitinclusiveinnovation.com/finalists). It's been incredible so far, and dot Learn is just one of many startups, like Andela and iROKO, in the growing tech ecosystem bursting in Lagos. It's hard to believe this journey all began with a basic Nokia phone.  ",

Many people feel frustrated and embattled against Trump and his supporters, and vice versa. But those who are frustrated only seem to speak to each other. If instead we each conversed with one person who didn't vote in the last election and persuaded him or her to vote, or we each talked to someone who voted differently than we did, and we managed to bridge the gap between us, we'd have a much better country and world. These dialogues alone would reach across the political divide. They could help probe, expose and dissolve false information and myths. We may each end up becoming more aware of our own assumptions and biases, altering our own views and finding new paths forward to bridge the chasm in ways that can benefit our nation as a whole. !Ethics of reporting on Trump&39;s mental fitness(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Ethics of reporting on Trump&39;s mental fitness(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180106200316-16-week-in- politics-0107-large-169.jpg) !Ethics of reporting on Trump's mental fitness(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180106200316-16-week-in- politics-0107-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Click to watch this video\")  JUST WATCHED  Ethics of reporting on Trump's mental fitness Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH Ethics of reporting on Trump's mental fitness 06:20 If nothing else, we can help move our country away from its current paralyzing political polarization. It doesn't take much effort, and it can have powerful effects. Undoubtedly, we all have extended family members, co-workers, in- laws, high school and college friends, and acquaintances who, based on conversations in recent years, didn't vote or staunchly oppose our own views. We could each make a list of these individuals, and then decide which might be most amenable to a conversation. We could say to them: \"I know we've disagreed at times in the past about how we look at the world, but I was wondering if we might be able to talk briefly, so we can understand each other better.\" We should offer to treat them for lunch, dinner, coffee or drinks. Once together, we could say, \"I was wondering how you feel about what's happening to our country and world today. How do you think we can make the world a better place? What do you think the world will be like in 10 years? Twenty years? One-hundred years? What do you think the world should be like? How can we get there? What do you think the environment will be like in 20 years? What should it be like? How do you think we can help it?\" Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) As we approach the 2018 election, billions of dollars(https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/cost.php) will no doubt be spent jamming swing state TV stations with nonstop political ads. But a free, grass- roots approach, as described here, can most help our teetering, troubled country and world. Some of the individuals we approach may be wary and refuse us. Or they may agree to talk but the dialogue proves unfruitful. Yet other conversations may lead to important reflections on these crucial questions. Two or three of us may need to speak with someone who didn't vote or voted differently than we did, to prompt reconsiderations of these issues. But we should all try. Even if only half of us succeed, we can, literally, change the world.  ",
