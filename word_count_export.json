In response to new rules requiring businesses to publish pay figures, a number claimed to have 50% male and 50% female staff. The government said this was \"statistically improbable\" and called on firms to check their information. The Fawcett Society called for a clampdown on potential \"fake data\". Companies with 250 or more workers will have to calculate their gender pay gap and publish it on a government website.    About 9,000 employers have to publish their data by 4 April 2018, or 30 March for the public sector. So far [about 750, including the BBC, have done so](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42580194). Two dozen companies say they have a gender pay gap of zero, with 10 of them claiming that precisely 50% of lower, middle, upper and higher wage earners are female and 50% are male.  Image copyrightGoogleImage caption McDonald's said the figures were being updated  Catharine Clark, from Finchley-based Fore Street Employment Agency, one of the companies that reported absolute equality, said: \"I don't think we've filled this out right and we are going to look at it again. Although we're not wrong in saying we have no gender pay gap.\" A Khan Ltd, which is the franchise holder for McDonald's in Newcastle's Northumberland Street, [is another of the companies reporting a 0% gap.](https ://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/employer-details?view=hourly- rate&id=09BYROMhYkw8r6B_wlZDQQ%21%21) A spokeswoman said the figures were \"entered in error\" because numbers had to be added to complete the registration for the government system. She said McDonald's themselves would be providing the correct figures as they use their payroll for staff. McDonald's said the figures \"are in the process of being updated\".

It's possible that we are looking at fake data in some cases. \"The government needs to act urgently and give the Equality and Human Rights Commission the power and resources to effectively crack down on businesses who don't comply with the law.\" Anthony Horrigan, from workforce analytics company Staffmetrix, said: \"Companies with modern data-collection processes will find this easier. Some companies will have some of their data, such as the payroll, on one system and other data on different systems. However, everyone has to get on and do this.\" A Government Equalities Office spokesman said the department would be following up with employers where \"statistically improbable data has been reported\" to help them get it right. He added: \"Employers have until 4 April 2018, or 30 March 2018 for the public sector, to report their gender pay gap. They must also ensure that the information they publish is accurate. This is not an option, it is the law, so they need to get on and do it. \"Any evidence that employers are breaching the law can be investigated and they risk being subject to enforcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.\" The employer to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% gap between male and female staff.   Phase Eight said the figure did not reflect the \"true story\" of the business as most male employees are in higher-paid head office roles rather than in shops. The pay gap is calculated based on the difference in the mean hourly rate earned by male and female staff.  ] ",

That was the conclusion of[ a report from the Children's Commissioner,](https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/Growing-Up-North-March-2018-1.pdf) Anne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide?  There are varying levels of deprivation   There were higher proportions of [children claiming free school meals](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their- characteristics-january-2017) in the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017.    Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than \\xa37,400 a year excluding income from benefits.  * [Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41983610) And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long- term, entrenched deprivation.  There are strong links between deprivation and how well children do at school The link between [deprivation and how well children do at school](https://www.suttontrust.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/1Attainment_deprived_schools_summary.pdf) has been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a \"double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school\", she said.   * [Northern children 'too often left behind'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43500164)   * [Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38172816)  But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived.   He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. \"Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,\" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were \"overly impressed by schools' level of attainment\" rather than looking at children's progress.  * [Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34964522) But even accounting for that, there are still [regional differences when you look at how well schools are rated](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ofsted!/vizhome/Dataview/Viewregionalperformanceovertime) in the comparably deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber.  It's not as simple as north vs south In 2015, the government produced figures on [multiple indices of deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465791 /English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Statistical_Release.pdf) looking at seven main things:   * Income   * Employment   * Health deprivation and disability   * Education, skills and training   * Barriers to housing and services   * Crime   * Living environment  And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as \"south=rich, north=poor\". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas.

Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country.   Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average.   But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government, [starting from the mid- 1990s.](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8006) In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment.  What about the money?   A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like:   * Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals   * Children in the care of the state   * Children with special education needs   * Children who speak English as an additional language   * Schools in areas with a high cost of living  The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving \\xa3500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.  ] ",

The analysis says in the North East 35% of white working-class students have entered with only vocational exams. The think tank is calling for more recognition of how exams other than A-levels are used to get into university, particularly by poorer students. And it warns of \"institutional snobbery\" against vocational exams. The research from the Social Market Foundation highlights how vocational qualifications are used for university applications - with about a fifth of places being awarded entirely on the basis of vocational exams.     Vocational exams 'ignored' But this is not evenly spread - with the report highlighting that working- class students from the north of England are particularly likely to have gained places with vocational qualifications. Young people from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications, such as BTecs. Children from poorer families are twice as likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications than the children of professional families. There is also a regional difference, with fewer people in the South applying with vocational qualifications. The think tank says this social divide produces an unhelpful bias in the system - with A-levels dominating political debate about university entry. The report says the emphasis on A-levels means that universities do not always give enough support or recognition for applicants with vocational qualifications. Entry requirements can often be set in A-levels, with the risk of putting off applicants with vocational qualifications. \"For too long, politicians and the media alike have ignored and even belittled the vocational route, because politics and the media are dominated by people who took the traditional route of A-levels then university,\" said James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation. \"Most of the people who run the country didn't do BTecs, and they don't come from the sort of background where BTecs matter most. \"The result is institutional snobbery against vocational qualifications and the people who have them.\" Maddalaine Ansell, chief executive of the University Alliance group of universities, said there had to be support for vocational alternatives to A-levels as a route into higher education - so they did not \"end up being dead-ends\".  ] ",

Also pupils' progress in digital skills has not kept pace with technology, said Estyn in its annual report. The chief inspector welcomed a shift towards a \"culture of self-improvement\" and more joint working between schools. Half of secondary and 70% of primary schools inspected were judged good or excellent in 2016-17. This is broadly in line with overall results since 2010 with the rest judged adequate or unsatisfactory.    Looking after pupils' wellbeing is one of the strongest features of the education system, while standards and teaching are relatively weaker, according to Estyn. Chief inspector Meilyr Rowlands said \"there is much to be proud of in the Welsh education system\" and there are \"many strengths\" in nurseries, maintained special schools and in further education colleges. \"Variability, however, remains a challenge in most other sectors,\" he said. The education secretary welcomed the report as showing sustained momentum in the education system. Estyn's 2016-17 annual report looks at key policy areas over the past seven years, back to 2010 when the current inspection cycle began.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Literacy and numeracy** [Poor results in Pisa international tests](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-25196974) were a key reason for introducing a new emphasis on literacy and numeracy in 2013 as well as a [national reading and numeracy test for seven to 14-year-olds.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38172346) The report says that since then there have been improvements in how schools promote literacy but the standard of pupils' writing is weaker than other aspects. In many primary schools \"pupils struggle to write creatively and do not write at length frequently enough\" and \"too many pupils continue to make basic errors in spelling and punctuation\". Over the seven-year inspection cycle the inspectorate found that in primary schools \"enthusiasm for literature, their knowledge of different authors and stories, and their ability to express preferences about specific books, authors or genres have declined\". Overall the report found that the teaching of numeracy has improved. But the report says: \"In about a third of primary schools and three-fifths of secondary schools, there are shortcomings in the way that schools plan for and ensure that pupils use and develop their numeracy skills across the curriculum.\"   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Developing digital skills** There has been an emphasis on boosting digital and information technology skills in recent years and, along with literacy and numeracy, schools will be expected to emphasise it in all elements of the new curriculum which will be rolled out from 2022. But the report says that opportunities to develop information communication technology (ICT) skills across subjects are \"limited in many secondary schools and a third of primary schools\". In just under two-thirds of primary schools, there are \"important shortcomings in standards of ICT\". Though most pupils are confident using programmes such as word processing and creating presentations, their skills are often limited to \"a narrow range of applications\".   * [Are Welsh schools teaching enough digital skills?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39455837)   * [Learning on iPads 'more enjoyable'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37429889)   * [Computers 'do not improve pupils' results'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34174796)    Image copyrightGetty Images  **The Foundation Phase** Since 2011, three to seven-year-olds have been taught through the [Foundation Phase](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42271232), which is meant to be a less formal way of learning through activities. But the report says that overall its application has been \"inconsistent\" and though there is generally a strong commitment to the principles \"more recently there has been increasing formality\". It says only about a quarter of schools deliver the Foundation Phase well and about three-quarters of head teachers do not fully understand the principles behind it.     [Click to see content: estyn1_jan18](//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/estyn1_jan18)     **Tackling the effects of disadvantage** Another major priority in education policy over the past seven years has been tackling the impact of poverty on pupils' performance at school and, though the chief inspector has found that there is now a stronger focus in schools on this aim, [the gap has not narrowed at GCSE](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-41513404). The report also notes \"despite some improvements, the attendance of pupils that are eligible for free school meals continues to be a concern at all phases\". Over the last three years, about 40% of 14 to 16-year-olds eligible for free school meals have less than 90% attendance compared to 16% of other pupils.

But in a third of schools more able pupils \"do not achieve what they are capable of\". Standards of wellbeing have been good or better in seven in 10 schools and attendance has improved in most schools. But the quality of teaching has varied over the past seven years. In 2016-17, 20% of the primary schools inspected were judged as excellent, and six schools (3%) were put in special measures due to failings.   Image copyrightGetty Images  **Secondary schools** Half of secondary schools inspected in 2016-17 were good or excellent, a significantly lower proportion than primary schools. The report says that one possible reason why primary school inspection outcomes are better on average than those for secondary schools is the effect that external examinations can have. The proportion of schools with unsatisfactory standards generally increased between 2010 and 2017. Schools have performed well in terms of pupils' wellbeing and one of the greatest improvements has been in attendance, up from 91.4% in 2011 to 94.1% in 2017. Improved teaching is needed in a majority of schools inspected this year and over the past seven years, the report says.     **Welsh language development** When it comes to the Welsh language, in the early school years nearly all Welsh-medium schools and most English-medium schools pupils \"make a good start\" when learning to speak and listen in Welsh. But there are weaknesses in the way many local authorities plan for Welsh language provision and recruiting Welsh medium staff is \"a challenge across many areas of Wales\", says the report.   ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05vvl86.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionOldcastle Primary in Bridgend already collaborates with other schools on numeracy  School-to school collaboration More cooperation between schools is seen as one of the biggest shifts in education over the past seven years and Estyn believes there is enough excellence across Welsh education to support improvement and help reduce variability. The \"spirit of cooperation\" was most obvious in the way that the new curriculum is being developed.    Political and professional reaction David Evans, Wales secretary of the teaching union, National Education Union Cymru (NEU), said: \"This report shows that despite increasingly difficult funding settlements and the ongoing concerns of workload, schools and teachers in Wales are continuing to provide an education service we can be proud of. \" He said it was \"especially good news\" to see Estyn praising schools for working constructively together. Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said the move towards a culture of self-improvement within Welsh education was not enough to raise standards. He said: \"Everyone knows that unless the government urgently address the underlying issues of diminishing education budgets and failures on recruiting and retaining teachers, this new culture is merely a case of building a house on sand.\" Welsh Conservatives education spokesman Darren Millar said the report highlighted many of the same concerns from previous annual reports. \"It's clear that we need to make much more rapid progress to ensure that our children get the high quality education they deserve,\" he said. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"Our national mission for education seeks to raise standards, reduce the attainment gap and deliver an education system that is a source of national pride and enjoys public confidence. \"The report notes our efforts to reduce the attainment gap, but we know there is no room for complacency. \"That's why we're doubling the [Pupil Development Grant](http://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/schoolshome/deprivation/pdg- and-early-years-pdg/?lang=en) for our youngest learners, so that every child has the opportunity to reach their potential.\"  ] ",

Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed 2,387 schools would receive money from the \\xa3750m Pupil Equity Funding scheme in 2018-19. Schools in Glasgow will benefit from more than a sixth of the cash. They will receive a total of almost \\xa322m to help fund improvements at 191 schools. The amount of money each school will get is linked to the number of pupils it has receiving free school meals, with the money going directly to head teachers, allowing them to choose how to use the resources.    Mr Swinney announced the allocations to areas and schools ahead of the visit to St Francis RC Primary School in Dundee, where staff used part of the cash they received in 2017-18 to set up six week-long summer schools focused on boosting literacy, numeracy and wellbeing for pupils in the most deprived areas.  'Significant impact' He said: \"Every child should have the best possible start in life, no matter their background. Schools have a significant role to play in ensuring every child is given the right support to help them achieve their full potential. \"Our priority is to close the poverty-related attainment gap. This \\xa3120m of Pupil Equity Funding is aimed at doing just that. \"The funding is targeted towards schools who have the highest numbers of pupils receiving free school meals, so that the money is spent on the children who need it most.\"   He added: \"Last year's allocation is already making a big impact. I have visited a number of schools up and down the country where this funding has empowered teachers to put in place creative new initiatives that are tackling the attainment gap in their schools right now.\" Neil Lowden, head teacher of St Francis RC Primary School, said the cash from the scheme \"has had a significant impact on how I have managed my school in terms of the absolute focus on raising attainment in literacy and numeracy as well as improving outcomes in health and wellbeing for the children in St Francis\". He added: \"As a head teacher, the Pupil Equity Funding has fundamentally allowed our school community to make a real and significant difference to the lives of the children who come through our doors every day.\"  Temporary posts Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), said: \"The identification of funds to those pupils who need support is always helpful but unfortunately, it is replacing other support that has been lost during a continuous programme of education cuts. \"Schools always want to make a difference to those most disadvantaged with additional teachers to assist access to the curriculum and increase inclusion to activities that most other children take for granted. \"The major worry is the sustainability of the funding and the major investment in permanent highly-qualified professionals. \"The current arrangement has seen a large number of temporary posts being created that are not in the interest of the children who need regular and committed professionals to support them through their education journey.\" He added: \"PEP funding is a start but it cannot close, with the present limited funding, the gap to give the most deprived the same education experience as the most advantaged.\" The Scottish Parent Teacher Council said it had concerns about using free school meal claims as the basis for the allocation of funds. Executive director Eileen Prior said: \"We know there is some good work being done with the additional PEF funds but we are keen to see some hard evidence of impact on achievement and attainment.\"  ] ",

The local authority said other cuts being considered would affect services such as behaviour support and English as an additional language. The details are in a letter sent from the council to head teachers. In a statement, Highland Council said a \"wide range of proposals\" were being considered to help it make savings. The local authority's Independent-Lib Dem-Labour administration is having to tackle an estimated budget gap of \\xa325.8m in the coming financial year due what it what it calls the \"scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years\".     Cuts 'appalling' SNP councillor and former Dingwall Academy rector, Graham MacKenzie, has described the council's proposed cuts as \"appalling\" and said they would \"worsen\" the attainment gap in the Highlands. Teaching union the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said it would be concerned if the council pushed ahead with the proposals. In the letter, the council said reductions in additional support needs teachers and pupil support assistants had been proposed. However, it added that vacancies and the turnover in these roles were \"likely to protect all those presently in post\". Also proposed is a reduction in specialist additional support services, excluding NHS Highland-funded services. The letter said: \"This is likely to impact in educational psychology, behaviour support, English as an additional language, interrupted learning, autism, assistive technology, and pre-school support services.\" About 40 teaching posts could also be cut. This would affect medium-sized and larger secondary schools.  'Remain committed' Other possible savings outlined include having fewer crossing patrol personnel and \"significantly\" reducing funding to Inverness' Eden Court Theatre and to High Life Highland, which operates council-owned leisure centres, museums and libraries. The proposals will be considered by councillors on 15 February. In its statement, Highland Council said: \"We have managed to protect education in previous years, and there were no new saving measures for schools last year. \"But the scale of cuts imposed on the council over successive years means it is no longer possible to sustain that level of protection. \"We remain committed to supporting education and maintaining teacher numbers as far as we can, and especially for primary schools and rural communities.\" It added \"Other councils have made savings on additional need services in previous years, and we are now having to consider that. \"Other than this, there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in 90% of Highland schools, as we will protect all primary schools and our smaller secondary schools.\" Alistair Bell, Highlands secretary of the EIS, said that while the details set out in the letter were only proposals at this stage they were still a cause for concern. He told BBC Radio Scotland: \"If this is what is going to happen it is a grave situation for what is already a stretched service. \"At a time when the Scottish government is asking teachers in schools to bridge the attainment gap, this can only hinder that process.\"  ] ",

The [Brilliant Club](http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/) is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal. In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15. In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.  University gap This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.     Image caption Pupils get extra lessons with postgraduate students, showing them university is in reach  The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%. Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome. In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and \"classrooms fit for purpose\". In Philippi, she says: \"The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT [information and communications technology]. \"With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa.\" Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.  Image caption Putting young people in the frame for university  While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the \"academic and social skills\" needed to complete their degrees. But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons. The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking. In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and see, perhaps for the first time, what it's like to be a student and to show that it's an accessible target.  Unequal chances It's a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.  Image caption When pupils complete the course, they go on a visit to university to find about life as a student  University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education. Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year. But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered. Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university. \"Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement,\" says the impact report on AccessEd's pilot phase. But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [Liberia's big school experiment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Helping to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * [Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * [Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * [The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * [From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * [Terror survivor campaigns for open speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

The move has been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney in a bid to tackle a recruitment crisis in the profession. The Scottish government said it was providing \\xa31.3m to create hundreds more opportunities for people to qualify as teachers. Edinburgh's Queen Margaret and Napier universities will train new recruits from 2019. Mr Swinney said the government was addressing difficulties recruiting classroom staff and he hoped this would \"build capacity within teacher education\".    It comes as the EIS teaching union warned schools are facing a recruitment \"crisis\" - with this one of the reasons why they are demanding a 10% wage rise for teachers.  'Raising standards' Edinburgh Napier University will initially offer a total of 30 places on a one-year Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) course - which allows those who already have a degree to train as teachers - with a focus on maths and sciences. It is planned to expand that into areas such as English and computing, with up to 150 training places after three years. Queen Margaret University will recruit up to 120 students to an undergraduate primary course but will also have 20 places on a PGDE course for those who wish to be home economics teachers.  Image caption The move could create hundreds of new teachers  Mr Swinney said: \"Teachers have a key role to play in helping us raise standards and close the attainment gap. That is why we are doing everything we can to attract talented and enthusiastic people to the profession. \"We recognise that, in common with many other countries, it is hard to recruit teachers in the numbers we need, particularly in certain specialist subjects. \"Adding two additional universities to the institutions that offer initial teacher education, supported by \\xa31.3 million investment from the Scottish Government, means we can not only recruit additional teachers to take up post within the next two years but build capacity within teacher education. \"The two new teacher training courses offer more choice and flexibility for anyone considering teaching as a career, especially in the specialist home economic and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects where we know there are shortages at the moment.\"  'By teachers, for teachers' Kenneth Muir, chief executive and registrar of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, hailed the move as a \"landmark development in the provision of initial teacher education\". He added: \"We must continue to adapt to ensure we do not miss out to other professions on new, high quality teaching talent. \"It is important that high standards are maintained and we will ensure the courses offered by QMU and Napier universities satisfy fully our accreditation criteria.\" Alistair Sambell, vice principal and deputy vice chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, said: \"Our new teacher education programme will be designed by teachers, for teachers. \"As a university we have an applied approach to learning, and student placements in schools will be underpinned by practice-based learning in class, supported by practising teachers.\" Prof Petra Wend, principal of Queen Margaret University, added: \"Teacher education at QMU will offer research-informed, practice-based programmes developed in collaboration with professionals from the sector and inspired by the needs of Scottish children and schools today.\"  ] ",

The inspiring photo of Jahan Taab with her two-month-old was shared widely on social media. People were impressed by the 22-year-old's determination to continue the entrance exam despite her crying baby. Not wanting to abandon either, she decided to use the floor as a desk and cared for her baby at the same time.   Skip Twitter post by @ianbremmer  > Afghanistan.

The young mum's dedication paid off and she passed the exam to Nasirkhosraw Higher Education Institute in Nili city. She is hoping to get the money together to study sociology but the cost of the three-year course is between 10,000 and 12,000 Afghanis a term, which works out at around \\xa3100-120 ($140-$180).

'Beyond expectations' President of the the AYA, Parwiz Karimi told the BBC: \"We want Jahan to be an inspiration to other women in Afghanistan.\" Parwiz says women in Afghanistan are not always seen as equal to men and parents often prefer their sons to attend university.

England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed \\xa370m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities.    It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North.   * [Is there a north-south divide in schools?](/news/education-38172816)   * [Osborne urges action on north-south divide](/news/business-42893861)  The commissioner's research also finds:   * too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up   * more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good   * large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18   * there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities  Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. * * *  Teenagers' concerns Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. \"There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,\" said Hafsah. \"Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p062dkf7.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionHow Northern students see North-South education gap \"It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. \"It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. \"For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out. But it's not fair.\" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. \"A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. \"So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you.\" Qasim added: \"If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education.  Image caption Qasim says money plays a big part in opportunity  \"If you have more money, it does lead to more doors being opened for you. \"Some of us may have part-time jobs, but if your parents have a lot more money than other parents would do, then you won't have to get a part-time job so you can focus more on education, rather having a part-time job and having to pay for stuff.\" * * * Ms Longfield said that disadvantage manifested itself in childhood in many ways, including \"a lack of confidence, uncertainty and low expectation, isolated communities with narrow and poor job prospects, poor school results and poor connections to further and higher education\". She added: \"Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. \"There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. \"Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives.\"  Image copyrightOffice of the Children's CommissionerImage caption The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England  Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. \"The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do.\" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. \"We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. \"So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. \"Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. \"The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools.\"  'More to do' The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as \"Opportunity Areas\" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: \"We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. \"As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. \"Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes \\xa33.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, \\xa312m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home.\" The government has also committed \\xa370m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. \"By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England\"  ] ",

A historian, however, says no black soldiers fought for the Confederacy. Republican state representatives Bill Chumley and Mike Burns have proposed a bill to build the statue. [Mr Burns has said](http://www.wistv.com/story/36573044/2-upstate-lawmakers- call-for-monument-honoring-african-american-confederate-soldiers-at-state- house) such a \"monument can help educate current and future generations of a little-known but important part\" of state history. He added: \"These African-Americans, like many of their Caucasian contemporaries, stepped up to defend their home state during a tumultuous time in our country's history. Their service has largely been overlooked or forgotten.\"     ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05cjf9c.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionWhy do Confederate statues divide the United States? Mr Chumley said the plan was intended to honour any African American who served in the Confederacy, whether or not they picked up a gun to fight, [according to State newspaper](http://www.thestate.com/news/state/south- carolina/article192369769.html). \"We are all learning a lot. The purpose of the bill is education,\" he said.   * [Should Washington monument go?](/news/world-us-canada-40978515)   * [Why the fuss over Confederate statues?](/news/world-us-canada-40966800)  But University of South Carolina history professor emeritus Walter Edgar told the paper that no black people fought for the pro-slavery South. \"I have seen no documentation of black South Carolina soldiers fighting for the Confederacy,\" he said.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05cmbxc.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionCan removing Confederate statues help heal a nation? Professor Edgar, who wrote South Carolina: A History, said the state had even turned down free blacks who wanted to volunteer to fight during the US Civil War because they didn't want to arm African Americans. No black people served as soldiers and the only African Americans in the Confederate army from South Carolina were either slaves or free blacks forced to work as servants or in the kitchen, according to the academic. There is debate among historians over this issue. John Stauffer, a professor of African-American studies at Harvard University, says there were Confederate black soldiers. [He has previously estimated](https://www.theroot.com/yes-there-were-black- confederates-here-s-why-1790858546) that between 3,000 and 6,000 African Americans served in the rebel ranks, possibly because they were promised freedom by plantation owners. Professor Stauffer has calculated that another 100,000 or so black people supported the Confederacy as labourers and servants, building fortifications and batteries. The recent movement to erase Confederate iconography - including flags and monuments - accelerated after the 2015 shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. Lawmakers voted to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol grounds after the killings. Mr Burns did not support the removal and [explained his position in an op-ed in USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/09/south- carolina-confederate-flag-mike-burns-editorials-debates/29938783/).  ] ",

Where do morals come from? What is the difference between Jesus in the Bible and in other scriptures? These are just some of the questions the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) says that secondary school pupils grapple with on a regular basis. But the REC is warning that a shortage of religious education teachers could contribute to religious stereotyping and discrimination, leaving pupils at risk of becoming ignorant, or bigoted. It says high quality specialist teaching about all faiths, beliefs and world views is essential in a diverse society and is launching a campaign to try to attract more teachers into the profession. Government data shows that in 2017-18, only 405 of initial teacher training places in England for RE were filled - well below the target of 643; figures for Wales have not yet been published.    The figures come against a backdrop of [schools struggling to retain existing teachers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42873153) \\- last month a report found the number of qualified teachers leaving the profession (for reasons other than retirement) had increased from 6% (25,260) of the qualified workforce in 2011 to 8% (34,910) in 2016.  'The big mysteries of life' For Lynsey Wilkinson, head of religious education at Redhill Academy in Arnold near Nottingham, RE is important, given the range of views and opinions to which pupils are exposed. \"We live in a dynamic ever-changing society full of different perspectives, beliefs and cultures,\" says Miss Wilkinson. \"Learning about these things helps the pupils in my classroom see the world clearly and helps them develop a genuine understanding about the world and the people in it. \"And that understanding will help them to shape the society of the future - a better society.\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Miss Wilkinson says that while she does not have a religious faith herself, it's exhilarating to debate big questions of life with pupils. \"I don't consider myself religious, but there's an academic side to RE that's fascinating to me - the idea of approaching these huge concepts from an intellectual point of view is one I've developed a real passion for. \"I spend my day helping these tirelessly curious kids get to grips with the big mysteries of life, examining spiritual beliefs, walking them through abstract philosophical concepts and getting into spirited debates over morals and ethics.\"  'At risk of ignorance' Rudolf Eliott Lockhart, chief executive of the REC, says specialist teachers are crucial for keeping young people properly informed. \"Without good quality religious education delivered by a qualified RE teacher, who provides accurate and balanced information about the array of different world views that make up modern Britain, young people are placed at risk. \"Not only are they at risk of ignorance that might lead to misunderstanding or even bigotry, but as they go through life, they risk basing their knowledge, understanding and opinions on sources that perpetuate inaccurate and misleading stereotypes. If and when those prejudices and falsehoods surface in the classroom, well trained teachers of RE are equipped to challenge and correct them. \"With information and opinion so freely available on social media and other online sources, pupils need to be taught to differentiate between sources that are reliable and reputable and those that are more likely to lead to religious discrimination and hatred. \"It is clear that in Britain today, we need to develop a better understanding of different faiths and beliefs so that we build more cohesive communities. In a world where religious literacy is now a vital skill in all walks of life, the shortage of qualified RE teachers is a deep concern and needs to be urgently addressed.\"  What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Religious education remains compulsory at each key stage for all state-funded schools, including academies and free schools, and we expect all schools to fulfil their statutory duties. \"In addition, we have changed the law and the requirements in schools so that they have to actively promote mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.\" A spokesman for the Welsh government said: \"We are currently reforming the way in which initial teacher education is delivered - putting in place new accreditation criteria and strengthening the ways in which schools and universities work together. \"An advisory board has also been established to consider issues of teacher recruitment and retention. \"We believe that this, together with a new curriculum, a new approach to our foundation phase and a commitment to professional learning will help us attract the very best teachers.\"  ] ",

In his first public speech since taking up the post, Mr Hinds said schools needed a mix of traditional academic subjects and a sense of \"resilience\" and skills such as public speaking. Mr Hinds said that a high proportion of new jobs would require digital skills. He also called for improvements in vocational training for adults. The education secretary said young people needed the skills to be able to \"write apps\" as well as being able to use them.    He said lessons in computing were needed to prepare young people for industries being changed by artificial intelligence and the arrival of technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Speaking at the Education World Forum in London, Mr Hinds emphasised the need for both \"core academic subjects\" and other, \"soft skills\" that could make young people more employable.  'Sports and voluntary work' But in his first presentation since becoming education secretary in the recent ministerial reshuffle, he gave few clues about any significant change in direction. Instead, Mr Hinds focused on how schools needed to prepare people for a shifting jobs market - and the importance of skills in communication and developing character. \"I would suggest that there is nothing soft about these skills,\" he told this international education gathering. \"The hard reality of soft skills is, actually, these things around the workplace, and these things around character and resilience are important for anybody to achieve in life, as well as for the success of our economy,\" said Mr Hinds. He stressed the importance of the \"ethos of a school, the expectations set for students\" and activities such as \"sport, public speaking and voluntary work\". Mr Hinds said these would shape the \"character, resilience and workplace skills that our young people take with them\". The new education secretary also pointed to the importance of helping adults to retrain for a changing jobs market. The conference heard that the UK's economy could receive a huge financial boost if there were improvements in the levels of basic skills. Andreas Schleicher, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) director of education, said that a fifth of 15-year-olds in the UK struggled to achieve even the most basic levels in maths and reading. \"If the United Kingdom were to ensure that all students had at least basic skills, the economic gains could reach $3.6 trillion (\\xa32.58trn) in additional income for the economy over the working life of these students,\" he told the conference. On the basis of standards rising in other countries, Mr Schleicher said: \"Such improvements in educational performance are entirely realistic.\"  ] ",

Academics at Durham University found the \"apparent success\" of these wholly selective schools was down to their brighter and more advantaged pupils. They say increasing the number of schools that select pupils by ability would be dangerous for equality. The government said it was working to widen access to grammar schools. Grammar schools have a reputation for high academic achievement and dominate the top of the school league tables.     'Social segregation' But this research, based on the detailed results of nearly 550,000 pupils, suggests once the ability and social background of pupils is taken into account, grammar schools are no more or less effective than other schools. The research not only looked at the social backgrounds of grammar pupils, but also:   * rates of chronic poverty   * ethnicity   * home language   * special educational needs   * age in the year group  The findings suggest England's grammars take only a tiny proportion of pupils who are, or have been, eligible for free school meals.  Image copyrightGetty Images This is important, say the researchers, because such pupils' results tend to decline with every year they are on free meals. This means that other schools in selective areas are taking more than their fair share of the poorest and chronically poor pupils. The Conservative government had to abandon plans to allow new grammar schools to open, following its weak position in Parliament after the general election. But ministers are keen to continue to allow existing grammars to expand.  'No clear gain' An [analysis of pupil numbers by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42416365) showed the equivalent of 11 new selective schools had been created since 2010 as existing schools had expanded. Prof Stephen Gorard, from Durham's School of Education, said: \"Dividing children into the most able and the rest from an early age does not appear to lead to better results for either group. \"This means that the kind of social segregation experienced by children in selective areas in England, and the damage to social cohesion that ensues, is for no clear gain. \"This is not to decry the schools that are currently grammars, or the work of their staff. \"However, the findings mean that grammar schools in England endanger social cohesion for no clear improvement in overall results. The policy is a bad one.\" A Department for Education official said: \"We want every child to receive a world-class education and to give parents greater choice when it comes to picking the school that's right for them - grammar schools are a part of this. \"Around 60% of these schools already prioritise admissions for disadvantaged children, and we are continuing to work closely with the school sector to widen access further. \"Research shows that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds make better progress across core subjects in selective schools, and attain better results.\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: \"There is a wealth of evidence that selection at 11 works against the government's stated ambition of improving social mobility. \"Creating new grammars schools is not the best way to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Instead, greater investment in high quality early years education would have a bigger impact on life chances - 11 is too late to bridge the gap.\"  ] ",

A rise in the number of 18-year-olds by 2030 will push demand up by 50,000, the Higher Education Policy Institute says. A further 350,000 places will be needed to keep pace with the existing growing participation rate, it adds, but other factors may reduce that by 50,000. The government has set up a review of university fees and funding. Last year, 534,000 students were accepted on to the hundreds of mainly three- year degree courses on offer in England.    The Hepi report examines the impact of policy changes on university entrant rates, feeding a number of scenarios into the calculations to arrive at the 300,000 figure. The 18-year-old population has been declining steadily for a number of years, but from 2020 it will increase again, rising by nearly 23% by 2030, says Hepi.  Questions for future It estimates there will be 14,709 additional entrants arising from demography alone, which will amount to about 50,000 additional students by 2030. And if participation continues to increase at the current rate, about 350,000 extra places will be needed on top. Countervailing factors such as Brexit, are likely to reduce that total by about 50,000, the research says. Currently, more women than men go to university. And if males were to increase their rates of participation, the research says, 500,000 extra places would be needed in total by 2030. It notes that there is not much sign of a change ahead in this area but cautions that the higher education system would come under great pressure and require a comprehensive reassessment if there was.  'Large increase' Bahram Bekhradnia, one of the authors and Hepi president, said as nearly every new student required a government-subsidised loan, \"it is difficult to see - under the current finance model - how the policy of uncapped student recruitment can continue\". \"This is particularly pertinent given the constraints on public expenditure and the absence of any suggestion from the Treasury that more money will be available for higher education in the future,\" he added. The report says the policy consequences of this very likely large increase in demand need to be considered. \"Given the extent of the loan subsidy provided for student loans... the higher education budget will need to be significantly increased in order to meet the financial consequences,\" it says. They suggest a cap on student numbers may have to be reintroduced. A DfE spokesperson said: there were more people going to university than ever before - including record numbers of 18-year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds entering full-time. \"We want anyone with the talent and potential to have the opportunity to go to university, which is why we lifted the cap on student numbers and reduced barriers that people face. \"We are conducting a major review of post-18 education to ensure that the system provides genuine choice for young people, and students and taxpayers are getting value for money.\"  ] ",

Several members of my family, who had been chatting animatedly over mugs of hot sweet tea, were abruptly silent. We were all packed in a modest hotel room in Rameswaram, an island off the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The unnatural moment of stillness was instantly noticeable for two reasons - the sudden peal of rain beating against the windows, and the fact that there is rarely silence when my family, who live on three continents and talk every day on WhatsApp, get to be together. My aunt, who had been lying casually on her hotel bed, stood up to reach for her handbag. She pulled out a sanitary towel and handed it over to me.    \"This will tide you over until we can stop by a pharmacy,\" she said. And looking rather sadly at me, she added: \"You know what this means, don't you?\" I didn't. \"You won't be able to come to the temple.\"  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption The \"holy baths\" at Rameswaram, where people take a dip to pay their respects to ancestors  Our family were not holidaying in Rameswaram. Although tourism and fishery are the two dominant industries of the 60 sq km (23 sq miles) island, we were there for a very specific and sombre reason. It had been a year since the death of my beloved grandmother, the glue that kept our trans-continental family close. On hearing the news of her death last December, we had all taken the next available flight to attend her funeral.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption Tamil Nadu is a popular pilgrimage destination. A recent fire at Meenakshi temple destroyed dozens of shops  There are numerous traditions in Hindu culture surrounding death, depending on which part of India you're from. My family observes a set of South Indian Hindu rituals for the death of someone close. We took her body back to our family home, wrapped her in white cotton, laid her on a large banana leaf and prayed together. The men took her body for cremation - a moment I wished I could have attended. We hadn't eaten meat for 15 days after her death. We performed a special ceremony 90 days after. We said our goodbyes to each other at the airport, promising that we would meet again for the next stage of the ritual, the final chapter of our mourning, at Rameswaram - a well-known Hindu pilgrimage site.  Image caption Megha Mohan's grandmother as a younger woman  It is where my grandmother performed the final rites when my grandfather died 36 years ago. Rameswaram is famous for its historic temple, perched on the Bay of Bengal. Legend says that this was the place from where the Hindu god Rama built a bridge across the sea to Sri Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her abductor. At various points during the three flights and the bumpy car journey, I'd read about the long ornate corridors, sacred towers and huge engraved stone pillars, and how people came to Rameswaram at significant moments. I hadn't considered myself religious but it occurred to me that I was now also a pilgrim. I'd thought a lot about Rameswaram and what the final chapter of saying goodbye would be like in the months following my grandmother's death.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption Rameswaram is one of India's most popular centres for Hindu pilgrimage  Back in my aunt's hotel room, holding her sanitary pad, having her tell me that I was now excluded from entering the the final part of our shared family mourning, I found myself on the defensive. \"You're saying I can't come to the temple because I'm on my period?\" I asked curtly. She narrowed her eyes swiftly enough for me to know that that tone hadn't been welcome in my youth, and most certainly wouldn't be tolerated in adulthood. \"I'm sorry,\" I conceded quickly. \"But surely that's not what you're saying. You're not saying that I've flown all the way here to not be able to go with you inside the temple.\" \"It's not what I'm saying,\" she said. \"That's just the way it is.\" \"Says who, though?\" I pressed. \"It is the way it is. It is a big deal.\" The sentence was stern, indicating to everyone else in the room that it would not be wise to speak up in my defence even if they wanted to. They didn't. The decision was made. I would be waiting with the driver outside the temple. * * *  Find out more   * **From Our Own Correspondent** has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world   * [Listen on iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlq), get [the podcast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fooc) or listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST  * * * Growing up I'd been given a pass from family outings to the temple when I was menstruating. The reasons why varied. One aunt had told me that it was tradition preserved from a time when women didn't have modern sanitary materials to absorb menstrual flow. My mother had told me that it was because it was the one time of the month where women were exempt from any duties, including household chores, a time when women could rest completely. Speaking to academics recently, I found contradictory statements on exactly why women were excluded. One pointed to the Hindu practice of Chaupadi, where menstruating women are considered impure and unlucky during her period. Yet a priest told me that women are at their purest during their cycle and hence would be tainted by being exposed to others, even at a temple. * * *  You may also like: [Banished for bleeding](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt- sh/banished_for_bleeding) [My dad jokes about my first period](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-41324799/my-dad-jokes-about-my- first-period) ['It's OK to make mayonnaise while on your period'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-41311476/it-s-ok-to-make- mayonnaise-while-on-your-period) * * * Dr Arvind Sharma, a professor of religion at McGill University in Montreal who specialises in the role of women in Hinduism, said the restriction has to do with concepts of ritual purity and impurity. \"There are certain times when human beings are considered ritually impure, as upon contact with a dead body, or excreta and so on. Women are considered so during periods,\" he says, \"It's hard to answer why as religious texts do not give reasons. \"The form of Hinduism we are talking about here is Smarta Hinduism, or the kind of Hinduism found in the Smritis (ancient Hindu texts). But in Shakta Hinduism (which is the body of Hinduism that celebrates the feminine, the Goddesses), menstruation is considered purifying rather than polluting.\"  Image copyrightVidya Nair Menstruation has been a hot topic in India in recent years, with activists running missions to provide sanitary napkins to rural women. Indian women have also challenged taboos attached to menstruation by staging social media campaigns using provocative hashtags like HappyToBleed. A recent Bollywood film Pad Man, which has been called the world's [first feature film on periods](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment- arts-42732782), explored the subject. The film is inspired by the life of [Arunachalam Muruganantham](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26260978), a Tamil Nadu- based social activist who campaigned to provide low-cost sanitary pad machines in rural parts of South India where few women have access to them. The lead actor Akshay Kumar said: \"I have lived with women all my life, yet I have learnt more about the topic while making this film than ever before. This is not the Stone Age - menstruating is natural.\" All this played on my mind as I waited outside the temple, watching my family head through the gates.  Image copyrightVidya NairImage caption The \"corridor of 1,000 pillars\" at Rameswaram  I reached for my phone to WhatsApp a female cousin, who couldn't make it to the final ritual. She sympathised with me, and then she paused typing for a few moments. \"You shouldn't have told them you were on your period,\" she wrote finally. \"They wouldn't have known.\" \"Have you been to the temple on your period?\" I asked. \"Most women our age have,\" she said casually, and contradicting my aunt's earlier statement just half an hour earlier, she added, \"It's not that big a deal if no-one knows.\"  _Follow Megha Mohan on Twitter_[@meghamohan](https://twitter.com/meghamohan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  _Join the conversation - find us on_[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCStories/) _,_[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bbcstories/) _,_[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgKRB26m6M3okTSP7C_UwA) _and_[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbcstories) _._   ,  Have you had a similar experience?

Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: \"It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all.\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the \"bureaucratic burden\" on teachers.     Funding 'tight' But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to \"answer the question\" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: \"I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic.\"  Image copyrightEPAImage caption Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy  In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a \"top priority\". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the \"biggest threats\" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years, [recruitment targets for teaching have been missed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42340798) and schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending \\xa3835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures.  Freeze on exam changes The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: \"With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. \"And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. \"Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn.\" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead.  Teacher 'burnout' Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained \"if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession\", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against \"entirely unnecessary\" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called \"mocksteds\". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. \"In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them.\" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: \"This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. \"If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.\"  ] ",

Another school day gets under way at Tarbolton Primary. The 193 pupils now occupy a brand new building replacing the loved but leaky old schoolhouse. They have been in the new premises for around a year, roughly the same amount of time the Scottish government's \\xa3120m Pupil Equity Funding (PEF) scheme has been in place.  * [Schools share \\xa3120m in bid to close attainment gap](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-42866794) The scheme came from the desire of Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish government to close the poverty-related gap in educational achievement.    PEF aims to give children from poorer homes the same life chances as those in more affluent areas.   The actual cash allocation under the policy of \\xa31,200 per child is based on the number of children qualifying for free school meals. So Tarbolton Primary got \\xa372,000 in 2017/18, and will get a little more in 2018/19, about \\xa320,000 more than the national average. The policy manifests itself in different ways in different schools and here in South Ayrshire it is head teacher Jackie Blair who decides how to spend the cash.  Image caption Head teacher Jackie Blair says she knows what her school needs  She says that as a head teacher she knows her school inside out. \"You know where you want that money to go and you know where you think that money can make a big difference,\" she says. \"So to be able to work collegiately with your staff and make decisions locally is massive.\" Ms Blair is using the money to focus attention on the first three years of school, seeking to set solid foundations for the future.   One example is funding an early years practitioner to support class teachers. Ms Blair says that the school had always managed to raise pupil attainment but it could often take until the final year of primary to see the results. \"What we want to do is make that difference earlier because if we can do that, where might they be by the time they get to primary seven?\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption Education Secretary John Swinney said boosting schools was the government's \"defining mission\"  Teaching about the fish in the sea and some big words to go with them is Primary 1 teacher Jennifer Wallace who says the in-class back up from an early years practitioner makes a huge difference across the ability spectrum. Ms Wallace says: \"I think a lot of people have the perception that because all pupils are starting primary so they are all at the same level. \"That's absolutely not the case. \"It depends on home life, it depends on experiences in nursery and it depends on how engaged they are in learning.\" The primary one teacher says: \"We are able to reach all learners because you have got that extra pair of hands in class, which then further raises attainment.\"  Image copyrightThinkstock Running around in the playground is important to let off steam, but play itself has been identified as something PEF money can help with in terms of socialising, confidence and imagination. Early years practitioner Megan Hainey uses everyday objects like sticks and even cardboard boxes to help play and learning. Ms Hainey: \"The cardboard box can become a microwave one minute then it's a rocket. \"It's just about getting the children to use their imagination and they absolutely love it. \"We feel that's had a good impact when it comes to doing the imaginative writing.\" The notion of play and activity goes even further.  Image caption Deputy head Helen Ross says new ways of improving pupil confidence can be tried  Deputy head Helen Ross says using pupil equity funds to take 14 children, some as young as primary 2, who struggled to integrate into school life, on a four- day residential course had a big impact back in school. She says skills learned from activities such as abseiling fed right back into the classroom. Ms Ross says: \"They became very confident, responsible, working together very much as a team. \"That comes back into the classroom and the relationships they have with their peers when they are back in the class and the attitudes and relationships they have with adults in the school also.\" The first minister launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge three years ago in February 2015. The SNP hopes the policy will help reverse a sharp decline in Scottish education's international ratings, from organisations like PISA. But opponents such as the Scottish conservatives see the policy as a fig leaf covering up fundamental problems in areas such as teacher recruitment, retention and training, pointing out that the profession has 3,500 fewer teachers than when the SNP came to power almost 11 years ago. Head teacher Jackie Blair says: \"I personally haven't had an issue with staff recruitment. \"I think you have to recognise it is not having 100 teachers, it is having 50 particularly good teachers. \"I think that when you can give staff the resources the money and the autonomy to do what they can do best then that's when you are going to get the good results. \"I don't think it is just about filling the gaps with a body. \"It's about filling that gap with the correct person and using the money for training and resources to allow people to do the job they love is more important.\" Here at Tarbolton Primary staff say PEF has made a difference and is helping to close the attainment gap. They also seem to like the fact that in a profession full of prescription about what they have to do there is an area where they can decide for themselves. Whether other factors like teacher numbers and recruitment are an issue more widely is a matter for politicians to argue about. At the end of the school day the children head home happily oblivious to government policy. And that's probably just how it should be.  ] ",

Primary school students at a school in the Chinese district of Shunqing were faced with this question on a paper: \"If a ship had 26 sheep and 10 goats onboard, how old is the ship's captain?\" The question appeared on a recent fifth-grade level paper, intended for children around 11 years old. Pictures of the question, along with students' valiant attempts at answers, surfaced this week on Chinese social media - where it triggered debate and quickly went viral. Education officials later said the question was not a mistake, but meant to highlight \"critical awareness\".     Image copyrightWeiboImage caption It is not clear how many points the question (circled) was worth or if it was part of a bonus section  \"The captain is at least 18 because he has to be an adult to drive the ship,\" one student answered. \"The captain is 36, because 26+10 is 36 and the captain wanted them to add up to his age,\" another guessed. One student however, simply gave up. \"The captain's age is... I don't know. I can't solve this.\"   * [Chinese schools 'robbing young of individuality'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34605430)   * [China's students take on dreaded Gaokao](/news/world-asia-china-36457453)   * ['In 1977 I took an exam that changed China'](/news/world-asia-china-42135342)   * [Would Chinese-style education work on British kids?](/news/magazine-33735517)  Online, however, people weren't quite as generous. \"This question makes no logical sense at all. Does the teacher even know the answer?\" [said one commenter on Weibo](http://s.weibo.com/weibo/%25E8%2588%25B9%25E9%2595%25BF?topnav=1&wvr=6&b=11517214525753), a Chinese microblogging platform. \"If a school had 26 teachers, 10 of which weren't thinking, how old is the principal?\" another asked. Some however, defended the school - which has not been named - saying the question promoted critical thinking. \"The whole point of it is to make the students think. It's done that,\" one person commented. \"This question forces children to explain their thinking and gives them space to be creative. We should have more questions like this,\" another said.  'Think outside the box' [The Shunqing Education Department posted a statement on the 26 January](http://news.sina.com.cn/s/wh/2018-01-27/doc-ifyqzcxh0729685.shtml) saying the test had intended to \"examine... critical awareness and an ability to think independently\". \"Some surveys show that primary school students in our country lack a sense of critical awareness in regard to mathematics,\" it said. The traditional Chinese method of education heavily emphasises on note-taking and repetition, known as rote learning, which critics say hinders creative thinking. But the department said questions like the boat one \"enable students to challenge boundaries and think out of the box\". And of course, there's always that one person that has all the answers. \"The total weight of 26 sheep and 10 goat is 7,700kg, based on the average weight of each animal,\" said one Weibo commenter. \"In China, if you're driving a ship that has more than 5,000kg of cargo you need to have possessed a boat license for five years. The minimum age for getting a boat's license is 23, so he's at least 28.\"  ] ",

One said her line manager told her \"the BBC doesn't do equal pay\". The evidence was submitted ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary select committee hearing about the gender pay gap at the BBC. There, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee heard from the BBC's director general Tony Hall. Carrie Gracie, who recently resigned as the BBC's China editor over pay disparity, also appeared.    Most women who gave written evidence, via the BBC Women group, did not wish to give their names out of concern for their careers at the corporation. Here are the women's stories in full:  1\\. TV news presenter \"In 2017 just before the BBC published pay over \\xa3150,000, I was called unexpectedly offered an immediate pay rise. It became apparent that for nearly three years I had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more. As we are both BBC staff that means I have not just missed out on pay, but on pension contributions too. I am told that we are now being paid at the same rate per day, but there is no transparency.\"  2\\. Former BBC Scotland health correspondent Eleanor Bradford \"I was BBC Scotland's health correspondent from 2001 to 2016. I discovered I was one of the lowest paid correspondents at BBC Scotland, despite regularly appearing on UK-wide news and delivering exclusive stories. I regularly asked for a pay rise, and eventually cited equal pay legislation. This led to an immediate increase of \\xa35,000 but it was not backdated. I remained around \\xa310,000 below some male colleagues who were doing identical correspondent jobs. In one of my annual appraisals I was told I was a 'model correspondent'. I left the BBC.\"  3\\. National radio presenter \"I am an award-winning broadcaster with more than 20 years' experience. In 2014, I was offered a contract to present a flagship arts programme. Two men with no broadcasting experience who had also been given trial shifts presenting the programme during the search for a new presenter were paid 25% more per programme. Then I found out that the existing male presenter was being paid 50% more than me per programme. When I asked for the pay gap to be corrected the line manager told me 'the BBC doesn't do equal pay', and that in raising the issue I was being 'aggressive'. I refused to back down and eventually was given the same rate as my male colleague and it was backdated.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption Auditors PwC published a report on BBC pay on Tuesday  4\\. Reporter \"My full-time equivalent salary for making identical programmes is about half my male counterpart's. I challenged my grade and asked for an equal pay review. The BBC took months to deal with my enquiry and refused to recognise that it was a claim for my legal right to equal pay for equivalent work. Eventually I was offered a series of increases adding up to a total of between 20-25%, with minimal back pay, which I felt I had no option but to accept because of the stress involved. It has brought me nowhere close to the salary of my male colleague. He also gets extra resources for his programmes, at the expense of others. I don't resent my male colleague. He is talented and deserves it. But we need parity of pay, resources and opportunity.\"  5\\. National broadcaster \"Since July I have been offered a 65% pay rise, whilst also being told that the BBC is 'satisfied there was no issue of equal pay' in my case. In pay terms this offer would bring me in line with the lowest paid of the presenters who work on the same programme as I do. That is despite my longer service on that programme. In contractual terms I am still disadvantaged as, unlike fellow presenters, I am not on full staff so have not benefited from pension rights accrued over many years.\"  6\\. News programme presenter \"When I was appointed to my current job in October 2013, there followed six months of negotiations over my salary. It was eventually set at \\xa353,600 for three days per week. In absolute terms I am well paid and I recognise and appreciate this. However, at the time this sum was agreed, I had no idea of how my pay compared to that of my fellow presenters. On publication of the 'talent list' in July 2017, I learnt that I am paid hundreds of thousands less than some of my colleagues. I am also paid \\xa345,000 less than my immediate male predecessor. No-one has explained to me how such a discrepancy can be justified.\"  7\\. Sports broadcaster \"I have worked for the BBC for almost 30 years, both staff and freelance. I present major sports coverage on national radio. In 2017 my contract was worth \\xa319,000 for 50 days, reporting and presenting. This is an average day rate of \\xa3380. When I present one of the flagship radio sports programmes I am paid \\xa3500. I have been told the male presenter is paid \\xa31,200. Since raising the issue of equal pay I have been offered \\xa3650 which is still a long way short of equal pay. What you are worth is solely at the whim of management who essentially in sport are always men. I'm at the top of my game, knowledgeable and with three decades of experience, yet I'm scratching around to earn a living.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption The BBC's director general Tony Hall will address the select committee on Wednesday  8\\. UK-based on-air editor \"In 2017 I discovered one of the male UK-based editors reporting for the same flagship programmes is paid between 50% and 100% more. Since then it has become apparent other male on-air editors making equivalent news pieces, for the same news programmes, are also paid significantly more. The BBC has refused to accept there is an equal pay issue, but offered me an on-the-spot 10% increase. I have not accepted as it does not resolve the wider issue around pay inequality.\"  9\\. Nations and regions presenter \"I have co-presented with a male colleague for many years. Despite working fewer hours than me, he earns more. Pro-rata, I estimate he's paid around double what I earn for doing the same job. Both colleagues and the public would consider us equals. I raised the equal pay issue many times over the years, but nothing was done.\"  10\\. Sport editor \"I lead a sports team in a big city with Premier League teams in our patch. There are few women in equivalent jobs, none in a big city. I believe I have been paid less than my male counterparts across the UK for most of the time I have been doing this job. Four men doing the same job have confirmed their salary is higher by up to \\xa310,000. I have no confidence in the BBC review process. I tried asking for equal pay in 2017 and recently heard it is still under review.\"  11\\. Radio 4 reporter \"In 2017 I submitted an equal pay claim after finding out that a male colleague was being paid \\xa37,000 more for doing the same job. I made little progress, so I began a formal grievance. A few days before the hearing I was called in and offered \\xa34,500 extra a year. I was told it was not because they thought I had an equal pay claim, but a reward for hard work. I am considering further action as they refuse to backdate my pay.\"  12\\. National radio presenter \"I have worked alongside my male co-host for six years so far and for all that time have been paid at one third of the rate he is paid. We work broadly the same hours with equal production input into the programme. Pay query raised in autumn 2016, only to be told there was no issue. Pay revised July 2017. Case still subject to negotiation and part of NUJ collective grievance.\"  13\\. National radio presenter \"I used to present a breakfast news programme in BBC local radio. In 2013, Tony Hall set a target to increase the number of women presenting in local stations. Shortly afterwards I was told my job was at risk and then that I could stay, but only on half my previous salary. It was also half of the amount being paid to my then male co-presenter. As the sole breadwinner I eventually had no choice but to leave. I now present on BBC national radio and earn what I believe is less than half of my current male co-presenter's salary for the demanding show we both present.\"  14\\. Presenter regional news \"I am one of two main presenters on a regional TV news programme. I have the same role as my male colleague, contracted to the same number of hours and days per year. I am often called upon to present more demanding programmes, such as election debates, in preference to my male colleague. I have 28 years experience as a journalist. In 2012 I became aware of my male colleague's salary, which was a third more than the figure I had been offered. Despite assurances of a comprehensive pay review, none was forthcoming. There was a point blank refusal to a request for equal pay. Eventually I was given a 5% increase in 2017. I can't see any justification for the pay gap which remains.\" * * *  _Follow us on_[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/) _, on Twitter_[@BBCNewsEnts](https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts) _, or on Instagram at_[bbcnewsents](https://www.instagram.com/BBCNewsEnts/) _.

The policy has angered religious groups from many faiths as well as drawn ire from American conservatives. Canada Summer Jobs grant applicants must check a box on their forms stating they support human rights, including \"reproductive rights\". Mr Trudeau has dismissed the backlash as a \"kerfuffle\".  What is the controversial policy? A new clause in the grant application for the Canada Summer Jobs programme and the Youth Service Corps demands that applicants check a box that says:    \"My organisation's core mandate respect individual human rights in Canada\\u2026 these include reproductive rights and the rights to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, colour, mental or physical disability or sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.\" The jobs programme funds some 70,000 summer jobs for youths between the ages of 15-30. The clause was added after the government was forced to pay a court settlement to three anti-abortion groups after it denied them funding in 2017.  Is it a surprise? Mr Trudeau has made it no secret that he adamantly supports reproductive rights. When he first became leader of the Liberal Party in 2014, he banned anti- abortion candidates from running for office and insisted that all party members vote in favour of pro-choice.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Former White House staffer Sebastian Gorka is critical of the policy  \"Of course, you're more than allowed to have whatever beliefs you like,\" Mr Trudeau said during a town hall in Hamilton, Ontario last week. \"But when those beliefs lead to actions determined to restrict a woman's right to control her own body, that's where I, and I think we, draw the line as a country. And that's where we stand on that.\"  How has it been received in Canada? Pro-choice groups have applauded the decision, but many religious organisations and anti-abortion groups are outraged. The [Toronto Right to Life Association has already filed suit alleging discrimination, ](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/05/anti- abortion-group-takes-trudeau-government-to-court.html)just months after the government settled with the group for also denying them funding last year. Other religious groups who do not actively campaign against abortion have expressed concern that the policy penalises people for their beliefs. \"It requires an evaluation of employers based not on what they're going to do, but who they are and what they believe,\" says Ray Pennings, the executive vice president for the non-partisan Christian think-tank Cardus.  Why is it making waves in the US? The policy was debated on Fox News' morning programme Fox and Friends, while former White House staffer Sebastian [Gorka called Mr Trudeau \"reprehensible\" on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SebGorka/status/952266075072327681). On Fox and Friends, Jeanne Mancini, who organises the March for Life, said Mr Trudeau was \"out of touch with mainstream America\". \"We've lost over 60 million Americans to abortion. To the prime minister, I would just really want to talk to him,\" she said. But it is not the first time Mr Trudeau has run afoul of US conservatives. In 2017, US President Donald Trump cut funding for groups that provide abortion services, [prompting Mr Trudeau to pledge ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/ca9d6cd3-5c3c-469a-bb35-9a957f0ca5b9) $523m (C$650m; \\xa3376million) towards sex education and reproductive health initiatives around the world on International Women's Day.  ] ",

There were about [1,000 more permanent exclusions in the year 2015-16](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/permanent-and-fixed-period- exclusions-in-england-2015-to-2016) (6,685 exclusions in all) than there were the year before, according to government statistics. That's out of a total of the roughly 8 million children attending state schools in England. It works out as eight in every 10,000 primary and secondary school pupils, up from seven in every 10,000 the previous year. It's something the government says it's going to look at, in a review led by former children's minister Edward Timpson. But what do we already know about who gets excluded? Certain groups of children, and children in certain parts of the country, are much more likely than average to be expelled from school.     Special educational needs Almost half of all exclusions - either permanent or for a fixed period of time - are of pupils with identified special educational needs. Children with special educational needs are seven times more likely than the average to be permanently excluded, although this proportion has actually slightly fallen as the total number of exclusions has risen. Special educational needs cover a wide range of difficulties and disabilities, which makes learning harder for these children than for other pupils of a similar age. By far the most common reason given for permanently expelling a child is \"persistent disruptive behaviour\". Other less common reasons include physical and verbal abuse, bullying, racist or sexually inappropriate behaviour and drug and alcohol use. This isn't the whole story, though. The official statistics only capture formal exclusions. But there are concerns that some children are being \"managed out\" of schools in less formal ways.    Exclusions in numbers   * More than a quarter of permanent exclusions were pupils aged 14 - those just about to start their GCSE courses   * Boys were more than three times as likely as girls to be permanently excluded   * Pupils claiming free school meals - available to households on lower incomes - were about four times as likely to be excluded   * Pupils receiving support for special educational needs were the most likely to be excluded (seven times as often as those without special educational needs)   * Black Caribbean pupils were over three times more likely to be permanently excluded than the average   * Children in the West Midlands are twice as likely to be excluded (12 in every 10,000) as children in the South East of England (six in every 10,000)  _Source: Department for Education_    'Informally' excluded A [report by centre-left think tank IPPR](https://www.ippr.org/files/2017-10 /making-the-difference-report-october-2017.pdf), published in October, found the total number of children being taught in \"alternative provision\" for excluded children is far higher than the total number of reported exclusions. When children are excluded from mainstream or special schools they often end up in a pupil referral unit or an independent or non-registered school. Part of the gap identified by the IPPR is thought to be down to children who were informally excluded and so don't appear in the exclusion statistics, but do appear in the census of children in alternative provision. Another part of the explanation may be children staying in alternative provision for more than a year - so in subsequent years they appear in the alternative provision data but not in that year's tally of exclusions.   * [What is it like to be excluded from school?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-37563774)   * [Half of children expelled from school 'mentally ill'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40667089)  But pupil referral units were not designed to be permanent settings for children to complete their compulsory education. They were designed to refer them on to another mainstream or a special school. Kiran Gill, one of the authors of the IPPR report and founder of charity [The Difference](https://www.the-difference.com/), says: \"Increasing numbers of children are being referred close to their exams and end up doing their exams in pupil referral units.\" She says only 1% of GCSE candidates in pupil referral units leave with the five good GCSEs they would need to continue with their education (A*-C under the old system or grades 4-9 under incoming GCSE reforms). Last January, more than two-thirds of all pupils in alternative provision were in Years 10 and 11 - their GCSE years. School inspectorate Ofsted has raised concerns that schools are removing children from their rolls as they approach GCSE as a way of \"gaming the system\" in performance tables. There also appears to be a group of children who are being repeatedly, informally sent home from school due to difficult behaviour without ever being permanently, formally excluded, according to Catriona Moore, an education policy expert at the National Autistic Society. These children miss out on large parts of their schooling without showing up in the exclusions statistics, she says. Of a survey of 2,573 parents conducted by the charity, one in four said their child had been \"informally\" excluded at least once in the last year. Malcolm Trobe, of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says schools also have to consider the other children in a classroom. \"If you have a child whose behaviour is extremely disruptive and it's impacting the education of 28 other children in the class, you may have to take some serious action,\" he says. He adds that funding pressures have meant schools are less able to access external support like counselling, behavioural management and mental health services for young people and in some cases, \"the only way to access this external support for a child is to have them excluded\". Launching the government's external review of school exclusions, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: \"Children only get one chance at their education and they deserve the best. But for too many children - and often those who are most vulnerable - there are inconsistencies when it comes to their experiences of school and too many parents are left worried and concerned. \"That's not good enough which is why we are going to improve our understanding of these important issues and tackle them head on.\"    [Read more from Reality Check](http://www.bbc.co.uk/realitycheck) [Send us your questions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747) [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbcrealitycheck)   ] ",

The Morrissey House in Ontario offers a 13% discount to women on Mondays, recognising that women earn 87 cents for every dollar men earn in Canada. Owner Mark Serre said an irate customer has threatened to file a complaint with the provincial human rights commission. The new promotion also raises money for local charities that benefit women. Mr Serre said he has no problem with the customer complaining to the human rights commission, but he does not think the promotion is discriminatory.    \"It's his right. If he feels wronged, then I applaud him for taking it to the (commission). But I think he's taking it the wrong way,\" Mr Serre told the CBC. \"As a general rule of life, women should get paid equally. I think that's important. Is it worth my 13 per cent on a Monday night? Absolutely. Is it worth a conversation? Absolutely. I hope people embrace it.\" The Ontario Human Rights Commission investigates complaints that violate the province's human rights code, including complaints about discrimination against gender.

In 2013, another London, Ontario, establishment faced a human rights complaint because it offered women a 50% discount on cover on its \"ladies' night\". The human rights tribunal ruled that while the practice may have been discriminatory, it did not qualify as \"substantive discrimination\". \"There are many things that could be said about societal beliefs in Ontario, but the notion than men are less worthy than women is not among them,\" the tribunal ruled.  ] ",

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is making the announcement at a global conference in Senegal, as part of a new emphasis on targeting aid at education projects. Ms Mordaunt said supporting schools in poorer countries was a \"hard-headed\" investment in a more prosperous future. But aid agencies warned the amounts promised were still insufficient. Ms Mordaunt is promising \\xa3225m funding over three years at a global education conference in Dakar, hosted by France's President Emmanuel Macron and Senegal's President Macky Sall.     Building schools This event will see international leaders pledging funds for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), which works with developing countries on raising education standards in some of the poorest parts of the world. Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and now chair of the GPE, said that by \"increasing by 50% its commitment\" the UK would give \"millions of children an opportunity to go to school\". The UK government has faced accusations of either giving too much or too little in overseas aid. Backbench critics have called for a reduction in aid budgets when public services are under pressure at home. While aid agencies have called for the UK to show stronger leadership with more support for developing countries. The UK's previous contribution to this global education fund has been \\xa352m per year and will now offer up to \\xa375m per year - with the GPE a high- profile part of the UK's support for overseas education. But some aid agencies questioned whether such a full amount would be delivered, as this will be conditional on the level of contributions from other countries. If these other contributions from donors are not sufficient, as has happened previously, aid agencies warn that there will be no significant increase in the level of UK funding. Ms Mordaunt says that the UK wants to help prevent the \"terrible waste of potential\" when \"half the world's children leave primary school unable to read or write\".  Image copyrightUnicefImage caption War in South Sudan: Conflict has destroyed access to schools for millions of children  The UK's support will aim to keep 880,000 children in school for three years, including in countries caught up in political violence and war. The funding will build 2,400 classrooms and train 170,000 teachers. There will be an emphasis on teacher quality - after warnings from the United Nations that millions of children were attending schools in sub-Saharan Africa, but were [leaving without even learning the basics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41388080). * * *   * [The 350 million people who don 9t officially exist](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41730606)   * ['In school, but learning nothing'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41388080)   * [10 toughest places for girls to go to school](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41558486)   * ['Zero progress' on school places, says UN](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41149083)   * [What's it like to learn to read at 60?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41204118)  * * * \"We need an education revolution, but to succeed in tackling this global learning crisis, we will not just need to be open-hearted - we need to be hard-headed too,\" says Ms Mordaunt. \"The UK will lead the way by supporting countries' governments to fundamentally overhaul their education systems to make sure they can ultimately step up and provide a good education for their own people. \"All children deserve a decent education to make the most of their talents and to help lift themselves and their countries out of poverty - building a more prosperous and more stable future for us all.\"  'Sustainable approach' In the autumn, the international development select committee called for the UK government to give [more of its aid budget to education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42047678). A report from the committee said that at present about 7% of UK aid was spent on education.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Four out of five adult women in Niger are illiterate  It called for this to increase, arguing that improving schools and teaching would provide a more long-term and sustainable approach to development. But the committee chairman Stephen Twigg said he was \"very disappointed\" that the amount pledged by the UK was much less than recommended by the committee. He highlighted that the conditions attached to the amount promised could mean no real increase is delivered. Kate Osamor, Labour's shadow international development secretary, said: \"While it may sound like a lot of money, this is a deeply dispiriting announcement from the government\". She said that the amount promised would leave the GPE without enough funding was \"surrendering Britain's reputation as a global leader\". Aid campaigners have called for a bigger increase in financial support from the UK to match the scale of the challenge. The One campaign, which works to reduce poverty in Africa, says that this pledge is less generous than the previous funding round in 2014, when \\xa3300m was promised over four years. But this was conditional on levels of funding from other donor countries - and when this was not forthcoming the amount given by the UK was about \\xa350m per year. Romilly Greenhil of the One campaign said: \"A higher pledge would have given the UK a golden opportunity to demonstrate global leadership on education and use our expertise to promote quality education for all - an opportunity that now risks being lost.\" This week figures from Unicef showed that almost a third of young people living in countries affected by conflict, mostly in Africa, were illiterate.  ] ",

Specialist staffing levels have dropped by 14% over seven years, despite a 31% rise in the number of children requiring support, says the Consortium for Research in Deaf Education (CRIDE). Almost 60% of existing specialist staff are due to retire within 15 years. Ministers say an extra \\xa3223m is being spent on special needs education. But the National Deaf Children's Society says there has been a \"dereliction of duty\".    Its CEO, Susan Daniels, urged the government to act: \"The evidence couldn't be clearer. From every angle and at every turn, a whole generation of deaf children will have their futures decimated if the Government doesn't act before it's too late.\" She added that despite deafness not being a learning disability, deaf children often fell \"a whole grade behind their hearing friends at school\".  * [Welsh deaf pupils 'underachieve' at key stages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39895438) The CRIDE survey of almost every authority in England found that more than a quarter of services employed one specialist teacher for every 80 students. In some areas there is one specialist teacher for every 100 students. The figures also revealed that a third of councils are struggling to recruit new specialist teaching staff.  Funding gap Responding to the CRIDE report, the Local Government Association warned that there had to be \"additional funding\" from the government to ensure councils meet their legal requirements towards students with additional needs. Last year, the LGA estimated that the [shortfall in children's services budgets would reach \\xa32bn by 2020](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-39849120). [State schools are expected to face a funding gap by the same year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-39292344) according to Education Policy Institute analysis. Cllr Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: \"The recent Provisional Local Government Finance Settlement provided no new money for these vital services. The upcoming final settlement must urgently address this. \"If it doesn't, some councils may struggle to meet their statutory responsibilities.\" Despite the funding challenges, attainment among deaf students rose to a record high in 2015/16 with 47% achieving 5 A*- C GCSE grades. The government says it has committed \\xa3223m extra council funding to widespread special educational needs reforms in an effort to ensure deaf students \"get the support that is right for them\". Robert Goodwill, Minister of State for Children and Families, did not directly address the staffing shortages, but said \"most children who are deaf are able to attend their local schools while receiving expert advice, and for those with more complex needs there are specialist deaf schools.\"  ] ",

Councils will instead have to create a database to identify children not on a school register under plans to revamp home education. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams is due to give a statement on Tuesday. She will also announce plans for a \"comprehensive package of support\" for home educators, including exams help. The plans are for statutory guidance - [compared with the non-statutory guidance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-38603771) published a year ago, which Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, described at the time as \"disappointing\".    She called Tuesday's announcement a \"step in the right direction\". Councils do not need to be told if a child is home educated, unless they are removed from school. The new plans will not change that but will require councils to create a \"reasonably complete\" database so they can identify children who are not on a school register. Ms Williams will consult on how the database will be managed and look at which partners - such as health boards - will be able to contribute to it and whether independent schools should be required to tell councils about pupils in their schools.   * ['I should be home-schooled but I spent 10 months on Xbox'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-41476718)   * [Why I home-educate my daughter](/news/education-42103248)   * [Kids enjoy special play time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/42852581)   * [Home school worry after scurvy death](/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35380182)   Image copyrightWales News ServiceImage caption The CPS decided not to pursue its case of neglect against Dylan Seabridge's parents Glynn and Julie  Ms Holland and NSPCC Cymru both called for a compulsory register of home educated children after Dylan Seabridge - a home-educated eight-year-old - [died of scurvy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35380182) in Pembrokeshire in 2011. A report by the National Independent Safeguarding Board recommended the same thing. Instead, these new plans will outline the arrangements local authorities will be expected to put in place to identify home-educated children and assess the suitability of education. Support for home educators will include help with exam registrations, the same health offers made to children in school, making the [Hwb online learning portal](https://hwb.gov.wales/) available and support from Careers Wales. Ms Williams said: \"There are many valid, different and sometimes complex reasons why parents would choose to go down this route and in some cases this will be the best choice for the child. \"But this choice must be balanced with the right of children to receive a suitable education. \"Local authorities, by establishing a database supported by statutory guidance, will be able to assess whether a child is receiving a suitable education and, if they are educated at home, that home educators have the support they need.\" Ms Holland said she was pleased to see a \"step in the right direction\", adding: \"In reality it means there'll be a statutory requirement for local authorities to know who is being home educated and what those children are being taught.\" The NSPCC said a compulsory register would help to ensure children did not become \"invisible to authorities, adding: \"Greater support for home educators and steps to improve data are welcome but we would like to see the Welsh Government go further.\"  ] ",

The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) says schools too often refuse permission to attend its exams even if pupils will only be away for a couple of hours. Ministers say they support pupils taking arts exams in school hours. But RAD says the position is confusing and wants the guidance made clearer. [Since 2013, official guidance on term-time leave](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36277836) has said authorised absences should only be granted in \"exceptional circumstances\".    The RAD says this has caused problems for its own ballet examinations and is also an issue for children taking dance, drama and music exams with some other boards. According to RAD exams director Andrew McBirnie, before 2013 ballet exams could be run \"during the school day and the student was able to leave a class at say 10 o'clock, do their exam and be back by lunchtime - and that seemed to be a perfectly legitimate activity that the student might be doing as part of their all-round education. \"Increasingly over the last few years... there have been more and more schools saying: 'No we can't allow this any more because of this issue with unauthorised absence.'\"  'Mood music' In a recent letter to Ed Vaizey MP, England's education secretary Damian Hinds, said the government expected schools to be sympathetic to requests for leave to take these exams. \"As long as they are satisfied that time away from school will not have a negative effect on a child's education.\" But the letter also says the Department for Education does not explicitly state what constitutes an exceptional circumstance. \"These decisions are best made by head teachers who will know their pupils' individual circumstances best.\" In response, Mr Vaizey said: \"The supportive stance from Damian Hinds is hugely welcome - but greater clarity is still needed. \"I will continue to work with RAD on the issue and will write to the Minister for Education regarding new guidelines for schools\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Mr McBirnie welcomed Mr Vaizey's dialogue with Mr Hinds and hopes it will help persuade more heads to allow pupils to attend performing arts exams in school hours. However, he says the message is still mixed \"between what the guidelines say and the mood music\" from ministers. \"There is no definition or further guidelines about what \"exceptional circumstances\" means at all. So it totally comes down to the interpretation of that phrase which is very vague. \"What's exceptional for one head teacher might not be exceptional for another and to be honest leaving school for a dance exam is not exceptional, it's actually quite routine that children leave to take a dance or drama exam outside school and then come back.\" Ideally, Mr McBirnie says he would like examples of activities where schools would be expected to authorise absence added to the guidance. The National Association of Head Teachers said authorising absences was \"difficult territory for schools because they are so severely held to account for attendance figures\". Deputy General Secretary, Nick Brook, agreed that \"in truth external arts exams are not exceptional circumstances, they are a well understood everyday element of school life. \"A list of approved activities risks creating unnecessary tension. \"What's important is that as long as the school is satisfied that time away will not have a negative effect on a child's education, absence to attend an external exam should be reason enough.\"  ] ",

More women and ethnic minority MPs are expected to be promoted. The prime minister suffered a setback on Monday when Justine Greening resigned instead of being moved from the role of education secretary to that of work and pensions secretary. Mrs May was reportedly \"disappointed\" by the decision. Ms Greening is replaced in the education role by Damian Hinds, while Esther McVey takes over work and pensions. The other major changes are that Brandon Lewis becomes Conservative Party chairman, Matt Hancock becomes culture secretary and Karen Bradley is made Northern Ireland secretary. Here's a [summary of the reshuffle](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk- politics-42602570) so far.

He has faced criticism for making comments on Twitter in the past which have been described as offensive. A petition calling for his dismissal from the Office for Students gathered almost 220,000 signatures. Writing on his Spectator magazine blog, Mr Young said he had been portrayed as a \"caricature\", but apologised for posts that had been \"ill-judged or just plain wrong\".  North Korea to attend Winter Olympics The Winter Olympic Games begin in South Korea next month and one of the big questions has been whether North Korea - which has caused alarm in the region with its missile testing - will take part.

The South has also called for competitors from both Koreas to march together at the opening ceremony of the Games in Pyeongchang - but it's not known whether the North supports the idea.

Ms Gracie, who resigned from the post at the weekend, said she had discovered an \"enormous gap\" between her salary and that of her male counterparts. The BBC said \"fairness in pay\" was \"vital\". The EHRC said it would consider whether \"further action\" was needed once it had received the policy details and the \"facts\" on Ms Gracie's pay.

The health claims that swirl around coconut oil are treated with a great deal of scepticism by scientists. If anything coconut oil is seen, in the scientific community, as an unhealthy fat.

The Financial Times reports that the prime minister's appointment of pro-European David Lidington as her \"right-hand man\" (Cabinet Office minister) reinforces the position of Conservatives who want to stay close to the EU's economic model after Brexit. And the Daily Mail says Monday's reshuffle began badly when it was incorrectly tweeted that Chris Grayling had been made Tory chairman.

Technology of Business has garnered opinions from dozens of companies on what they think will be the dominant global tech trends in 2018. Artificial intelligence (AI) dominates the landscape, closely followed, as ever, by cyber-security. But is AI an enemy or an ally? Whether helping to identify diseases and develop new drugs, or powering driverless cars and air traffic management systems, the consensus is that AI will start to deliver in 2018, justifying last year's sometimes hysterical hype. It will make its presence felt almost everywhere.  * [AI early diagnosis could save heart and cancer patients](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42357257?intlink_from_url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/ce1qrvleleqt/artificial-intelligence&link_location=live-reporting-story) AI can sift through vast amounts of digital data, learn and improve, spot patterns we can't hope to see, and hopefully make sensible decisions based on those insights. The key question is how much freedom should we give AI-powered systems to make their own decisions without any human intervention?     ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05sng43.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionFed up with motorway driving? Now you can switch to virtual reality A driverless car making a split-second decision to apply the brakes or swerve to avoid an accident makes obvious sense. It can react much faster than we can. But an autonomous weapons system deciding to fire on what it thinks are \"insurgents\" based on what it has learned from previous experience? That's not so easy.  * [Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think?](/news/business-41035201) Yet almost by stealth, AI is infiltrating almost all aspects of our working lives, from machine learning algorithms improving the accuracy of translation software, to call centre chatbots answering our questions. \"AI-powered chatbots will continue to get better at conveying information that can help consumers make better, more informed purchase decisions,\" says Luka Crnkovic-Friis, chief executive of Peltarion, a Swedish AI specialist. Customer experience firm Servion predicts that by 2020, 95% of all customer interactions will involve voice-powered AI, and that 2018 will be the year this really takes off.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Will chatbots become indistinguishable from human helpers?  \"Advances in speech recognition, biometric identification, and neurolinguistics will also mean that as we interact with businesses and brands via voice, our experiences will become increasingly conversational and human- like,\" says Servion's Shashi Nirale. J. Walker Smith, executive chairman of Kantar Futures, agrees, saying that \"learning emotional empathy is the final barrier to AI's full-scale market growth\". Talking to machines will become as natural as typing used to be, the tech utopians believe. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google's Home voice- activated assistants are already in many homes, rapidly learning new skills.  * [Amazon's Alexa heads to the workplace](/news/technology-42190140) In the workplace, these digital assistants - think of IBM's Watson - will give employees \"more immediate access to data\" that will lead to \"a reduction in repetitive or administrative tasks in their roles\", say Javier Diez-Aguirre, vice president of corporate marketing at office equipment maker Ricoh Europe. This means that AI-powered machines \"will become colleagues, not competitors\", concludes Mark Curtis, co-founder of Fjord, the Accenture-owned design and innovation company.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Will we see AI-powered machines as helpers or rivals in the workplace?  AI-powered human resources systems could even help workforces become \"superhuman\", argues Pete Schlampp, vice president of analytics at software platform Workday. All those forecast to lose their jobs as a result of AI-powered automation may disagree.  * [Robots to 'take 800 million jobs by 2030'](/news/world-us-canada-42170100) And global collaboration will become easier, the world smaller, as translation services become more accurate, argues Alec Dafferner, director of GP Bullhound, a San Francisco-based tech investment and advisory firm. \"Driven by machine learning - seamless and instantaneous translation will become the new normal,\" he says. There seem to be few areas AI will not permeate, from recruitment to facial recognition, cyber-security to energy management systems.  * ['Superhuman' Google AI claims chess crown](/news/technology-42251535) The explosion in the amount of data generated by mobile devices, computers and the \"internet of things\" is feeding these learning algorithms. While the ability to analyse it all in real time using virtually unlimited cloud computing power has accelerated the pace of development. AI still operates according to the rules we set - until we allow it to develop its own rules, of course. But what if those rules and assumptions are inherently biased?  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05rv4fh.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionCan AI keep Marwell Zoo's animals warm? It's something Rob McCargow, AI programme leader at global consultancy firm PwC, warns about, particularly in the field of recruitment and human resources. \"AI-augmented recruitment stands out as a key growth area with a range of offerings in the market,\" he says. \"But if not governed and implemented responsibly, it can lead to an amplification of bias and discrimination.\" In other words, if past data shows the algorithm that white middle-class males have previously performed well at a company, it might conclude that this is the type of candidate it should select in future, reinforcing gender and racial stereotypes. An example of AI not acting intelligently at all. The old computing maxim \"rubbish in, rubbish out\", still applies.  Cyber-security: 'Weaponised AI' While many cyber-security firms point out AI's potential in combating cyber- attacks - monitoring computer networks in real time for signs of abnormal behaviour, for example - others soberly observe that AI will also be \"weaponised\" by the hackers. \"2018 could be the year we see the first battle of the AI bots,\" warns Dr Adrian Nish, head of threat intelligence at BAE Systems.

We may already be at this point, with online Twitter bots able to react to emerging events and crafting messages to respond.\" Simple but effective email phishing attacks, whereby employees are hoodwinked into clicking on dodgy links or downloading malware because they think the message is from someone genuine, could reach another level of sophistication, says Dave Palmer, director of technology at security firm, Darktrace.  * [Three words to set alarm bells off for every firm](/news/business-39429819) Imagine a piece of malware that can train itself on how your writing style differs depending on who you are contacting and uses this to send relevant messages to your contacts, he says. \"These phishing messages will be so realistic that the target will fall for them. Such advances in AI will take us to the next stage in defenders versus attackers, and we need to be ready.\"  More Technology of Business  Image copyrightGetty Images   * ['We should own our own livelihood and our own dream'](/news/business-42188808)   * [How did music producer Gramatik raise $2m in 24 hours?](/news/42337546)   * [Lock out: The Austrian hotel that was hacked four times](/news/business-42352326)   * [Buy food for the family or pay to see a doctor?](/news/business-42309911)  Cyber-security experts also warn about a growing threat to the integrity of data - hackers sabotaging data rather than stealing it. You can do a lot of damage to a company's reputation, profits and share price if you mess with the facts on which it bases important investment decisions. The burgeoning number of internet-connected IoT devices is another soft target for hackers.

Meanwhile, businesses are steeling themselves for more ransomware attack, building up stockpiles of bitcoins with which to pay extortionists, says Chris Mayers of Citrix. AI will only accelerate the cyber-security arms race.  Blockchain, mixed reality and other trends While Bitcoin's price leaps up and down like a crazy bucking bronco - the underlying technology blockchain will make steady progress, many believe. The distributed ledger tech \"has the potential to add an important aspect of traceability to the foods we eat\", says Tony Rodriguez, chief technology officer at Digimarc Corporation. \"Walmart, Kroger, McCormick, Tyson Foods and others have teamed up with IBM to experiment with track-and-trace tests on Chinese pork and Mexican mangoes, and we expect blockchain to be used more prevalently in grocery, retail and other industries.\"  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p04sj9qn.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionKarishma Vaswani takes a look at blockchain and explains how it works International banks have already experimented with blockchain-based trading systems that cut out the need for any middleman. Meanwhile, lighter, more powerful virtual reality (VR) headsets will move the tech beyond gaming into more everyday uses, from looking round properties to virtual shopping, accurately recreating real stores. And augmented reality services on smartphones will begin to transform the static world around us into something more dynamic and interactive - a golden opportunity for brands to market their wares more entertainingly. \"This will bring new meaning to the phrase 'try before you buy',\" says Chris Wood, director of retail at Salesforce, the customer relationship management platform. Drones will extend their surveying and photographing work, helping farmers, utility companies, estate agents, insurance companies and emergency services. And driverless cars and trucks will continue to be tested.  * [How 'super vision' will change the way we see the world](/news/business-42097613) Philip Trillmich, a partner at international law firm White & Case, even thinks this will be the year \"we see substantial innovation in driverless cargo ships\". We will continue becoming a cashless society, with social media platforms offering more financial services and smartphones being used more for in-store payments. But AI will be the dominant theme - for good or ill.  * Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthew_wall) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MatthewWallBBC/)  * [Click here for more Technology of Business features](http://bbc.in/1LTVk7w)  ] ",

Their solution? Bar employers from asking job applicants what they currently earn, so new salary offers are not based on the previous figure. Laws are already on the books in a handful of jurisdictions, including California, Massachusetts, New York City and Puerto Rico. Similar measures are under consideration in more than 20 other states, as well as at the national level. The aim is to stop a hiring practice that critics say perpetuates the pay gap, since women often start out with lower salaries. \"What these bans are doing is ensuring that employers pay employees for the job they have to do,\" says Kate Nielson, state policy manager for the American Association for University Women, which supports the new laws.    \"There is a real attraction to this kind of policy because it is proactive.\"  Why now? The US has officially banned unequal pay for equal work since 1963, but what counts as equal can be controversial, as highlighted by recent rows in the UK at the BBC and Tesco. And unlike the UK - which now requires large companies to report publicly on pay by gender - the Trump administration recently suspended a rule that would compel firms to report similar data to the government.   * [Gender pay gap: What you need to know](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-42918951)   * [Equal pay day: What is the gender pay gap like where you are?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-england-41805053)   Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The idea has spread rapidly amid mounting frustration in the US over the pay gap  People who campaigned for the law in Massachusetts - which became the first place in the US to approve such a rule in 2016 - said they think the idea has caught on because it is simple and does not punish firms retroactively. \"Instead of taking the traditional approach... we wanted to actually create new standards to make sure that employers and businesses were being proactive,\" says Sasha Goodfriend, president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization for Women. \"It sometimes needs to be redefined in a new way to reignite an age-old conversation.\"  Gender gap On average, women in the US earn about 80% of the amount paid to men - [roughly comparable to the UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-42723960), according to [government statistics](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files /0779dc2f-4a4e-4386-b847-9ae919735acc/gender-pay-inequality----us-congress- joint-economic-committee.pdf). For black and Hispanic women, the gap is even wider. Some of the difference is due to factors like occupation or part-time work. Yet even after allowing for this, women just one year out of college earned about 7% less than men, a gap that widens over time, according to [research by the American Association for University Women](https://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/pdf_download/show_pdf.php?file=The- Simple-Truth).  Image copyrightA Rizo/TOMAS OVALLEImage caption Aileen Rizo sued her employer, which used prior pay to determine her salary  Aileen Rizo, 43, who coached math teachers for a school district in California, said she had not considered the link between the pay gap and salary inquiries - until she encountered it herself. In 2012, she confronted her employer after learning her pay was lower than that of co-workers in the same role. The district said the difference was due to a policy that set salaries based on prior pay, not gender discrimination. \"If you always look at my prior salary, I could never break that barrier,\" says Ms Rizo, who eventually filed a lawsuit. The dispute has not yet been finally resolved, but her case helped to galvanise support for new equal pay laws in California, including the ban on prior pay inquiries. \"I think maybe it's the right time,\" Ms Rizo says. \"The culture is shifting and women are finding their voice and finding empowerment.\"  Sea change The rules require a sea-change in hiring practices, especially for white collar fields. About 95% of more than 100 large and mid-size employers surveyed by human resources consulting firm Korn Ferry in November said they asked about candidates' pay histories.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption A recent survey by Robert Half found that 34% of women tried to negotiate higher salaries, compared to 46% of men  Companies typically offer about 10% above someone's current salary, says Katie Donovan, who founded the consulting firm Equal Pay Negotiations and previously worked in the staffing industry.   * [Gender pay gap: What every woman should know](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-39513573)   * [Important moments in the fight for equal pay](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-37899167)  In some cases, she says firms also use salaries to screen candidates, interpreting high pay as a proxy for competence and responsibility. \"They think it's an objective number when it's anything but,\" says Ms Donovan, who pushed to include the ban on prior pay queries in the Massachusetts law. \"The dirty little secret in hiring, is for the most part we pay people what they're willing to accept.\"  Firms' responses In liberal Massachusetts, advocates worked carefully to get business support for the proposal. Firms elsewhere were sometimes more resistant, worried the measure would induce higher research and costs during hiring.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Hiring experts say they see little sign that pay negotiations are becoming less important  In Philadelphia, the local Chamber of Commerce even sued on behalf of employers that included Comcast, charging that the measure violated free speech grounds, a case that is still being litigated. As the idea gains traction, however, companies are starting to adjust, says David Woolf, a Philadelphia-based partner at the law firm Drinker Biddle, who works on employment issues. \"I don't mean to suggest they like it,\" he says. \"It's just the reality now.\"  Possible drawbacks Ms Donovan and other supporters said they are hopeful the rule is a step toward companies setting salaries based on the job, not the person, noting research that has found women tend to [negotiate less](https://www.roberthalf.com/index.php/blog/compensation-and-benefits/who- most-likely-negotiated-salary) and [are less successful](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22961) when they do. But hiring experts say they see little sign that pay negotiations are becoming less important. Companies are asking candidates how much they want to get paid as a \"fallback\" says Mr Woolf. And if anything, the new rules are likely to prompt pay discussions to start earlier in the hiring process, says Paul McDonald, senior executive director at the staffing firm Robert Half.   * [Six ways to tackle the gender pay gap](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-37164297)   * [Gender pay gap to remain until 2069, report says](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-37460778)  Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, says he thinks the legislation could have other unintended consequences. For example, if job candidates don't volunteer salaries during the discussions, firms are likely to assume their pay is lower than it is.  Image copyrightGetty Images Mr Cappelli says this effect is likely to be especially pronounced for women and other groups that are statistically likely to have lower pay. \"The phrase for this is statistical discrimination,\" he says. \"Now we've got this quirky situation where it's actually likely to make things worse.\"  Practical impact Advocates say it will take a few years of job switching and hiring before they can say whether the measure is meeting its goal. They are not the only parties optimistic about change, however. About two-thirds of companies surveyed by Korn Ferry said they expect the legislation to improve pay equity at their firm by at least a small extent. Bob Wesselkamper, global leader of awards and benefit consulting at Korn Ferry, says many US companies have not examined the issue in recent years and may be overestimating the legislation's effects. Even with that caveat, he adds: \"I firmly believe that there will be organizations that will benefit ... and become a more fair and equitable environment because of this legislation.\" Ms Rizo and others add that they know this idea is not a silver bullet. They're also pushing for better accommodations for pregnancy, stronger sexual harassment laws and paid family and sick leave, which is not a national requirement in the US. \"I've seen a lot of progress,\" says Ms Rizo. \"There's still a lot of work to do\"  ] ",

Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, [published the advice](https://www.isc.co.uk/media-enquiries/news-press-releases-statements /good-exam-results-are-made-in-the-easter-holidays/) on the council's website. He said: \"That may seem a lot, but the students who get the best grades will be working this hard.\" But teachers and other experts said it was \"unrealistic\" and could put too much pressure on students. Mr Lenon, who retired as headmaster of Harrow School in 2011, offered five tips which included starting at 9am and working for no more than two hours at a time before taking a break.    He said: \"The best GCSE and A-level results don't go to the cleverest students - they go to those who revised in the Easter holidays.\"  'Work-life balance' His revision schedule would mean 100 hours of work over 14 days in the Easter holiday, with repeat sessions in the summer term and before the exam. Stephen Cumper, a teacher from Belfast, said the advice was \"complete nonsense\". \"Children need to have a work-life balance,\" he said. Colleen Shelley, a teacher in a private girls school in Hertfordshire, said: \"That's absolutely not acceptable. It's not realistic. \"We as adults don't function like that in a work environment. Work should be intermittent - revise in moderation and take breaks.\" Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a psychology professor at University College London who researches the adolescent brain, said teenagers were already under a lot of stress. [She said on Twitter: ](https://twitter.com/sjblakemore/status/979720705007747072)\"This generation of young people are under massive pressure, academically, socially... I'm not sure recommendations like this help much.\" One parent, Serian Walker, who is also a police officer, said in her profession she had dealt with suicides by children who could not cope with the pressure. Ms Walker, from Cardiff, said she struggled to get her 15-year-old daughter to take a break from revision. \"I know she isn't sleeping well and I know she's miserable. Of course I'd like her to excel, but not at the cost of her mental health,\" she said. But Clare Wagner, head teacher of the West London Free School, endorsed Mr Lenon's tips as \"excellent revision advice\".

Natasha, now in her final year at Queen Mary University of London, said that she relied on at least seven hours of study a day in the Easter holidays during her GCSEs and A-levels. \"Looking back, there is no way I would have been able to properly cover all the content you need to revise in fewer than seven hours a day. I can't see how you can get top grades and study fewer hours,\" she said. \"It is not about finding a work-life balance, it is about making a sacrifice.\"  ] ",

The Scottish government is considering incorporating the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) into a new body with additional responsibilities. The independent GTCS itself has expressed fears this will be costly, legally complex and achieve little. The Scottish government said it will consider all responses on the issue. A consultation on legislation to reform school governance closed earlier this week.    Much of the debate has centred on plans to give more powers to head teachers and on what powers local authorities should retain. But ministers are also looking at creating a new body called the Educational Workforce Council for Scotland which would be responsible for the work currently carried out by the GTCS.  International reputation The EIS union opposes scrapping the council and fears its replacement may not be independent of government. It said: \"The EIS is firmly opposed to any dilution of the role and independence of the General Teaching Council for Scotland. \"We fail to understand why the Scottish government feels compelled, or even entitled, to interfere in the running of what is a legally constituted independent body. \"The EIS has noted the high regard the GTCS is held in internationally. \"We are baffled as to why the Scottish government wishes to do away with a Scottish success story such as the GTCS.\" A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Our education reforms are focussed on giving schools and head teachers more power and money to raise standards and close the attainment gap. \"Our reform proposals are based on international evidence of how high- performing education systems work - and will deliver extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils. \"We welcome feedback in response to our consultation on the Education (Scotland) Bill and will consider all the responses received.\" * * *  A model of self-regulation  **by Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Education Correspondent** The main aim of the government's school reform plans is to empower heads and parents. It wants as much power as possible at as local a level as possible. The argument is that allowing heads to do what they believe to be right for their schools and encouraging positive involvement from parents is more likely to raise attainment. A proposal to abolish the existing General Teaching Council for Scotland and incorporate its role into a new body may seem to be of little direct concern to parents and learners but for many in the profession it would be a significant development. The GTCS sees itself as a model of how self-regulation can work. Its name is recognised by professionals well beyond Scotland. The arguments being advanced against axing the GTCS and creating a new body are detailed and sometimes complex - questions over the cost and whether the change would achieve anything positive are to the fore. But lurking in the background some have another concern. The GTCS has been formally independent of government in recent years. This means ministers cannot simply decree, for instance, that there should be changes to teacher training. Some will want reassurances that the proposed new workforce council would enjoy similar autonomy. Recently the English charity Teach First, which places trainees in the classroom at a relatively early stage, looked at whether it should be involved in the bid for a new teacher training contract in Scotland. It had, legitimately, tried to win friends and supporters in high places. Those in the profession who were concerned knew that, given the scale of the opposition within the profession here, such a course was unlikely to win GTCS accreditation even if some in government circles may have been impressed by the charity's work elsewhere. If critics of the plans for the GTCS are to be appeased, the government will need to reassure them that the replacement body will truly belong to the profession itself. * * * In its response to the consultation, the council said: \"The proposed loss of GTCS as an independent body has the potential to do irreparable harm to the status and identity of teachers.\" All teachers working in Scotland have to be registered with the GTCS which is responsible for upholding professional standards. It can also \"strike off\" teachers who are guilty of misconduct or who fail to make the grade but also helps teachers in their professional development. The government said it intends the body should operate independently from Scottish ministers. But the GTCS council believes there is no case for it to include those who are only indirectly responsible for children's education, such as school librarians and home-school link workers The GTCS is one of many bodies to have made submissions to the consultation on the governance review which closed this week.  ] ",

The Young Londoners Fund will support education, sport and cultural activities for disadvantaged people. It will be paid for through council tax and business rates. The three-year initiative was welcomed by campaigners who have been \"urging\" London's mayor to take action against a \\xa336m cut to youth services across London councils, since 2011. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the scheme will help bridge the gap after the government \"decimated\" youth services in the city.    \"For many young people, particularly those from deprived and disadvantaged communities, activities and services for young people offer support and help keep them on the straight and narrow,\" he added.  'Devastating cuts' The fund will be made up of \\xa310m a year for local groups, charities and schools to bid for funds, and \\xa35m a year to be invested in expanding existing projects. Green Party London Assembly Member Sian Berry hopes the fund will \"start to repair some of the damage\" from government cuts. [A report she worked on in 2017 ](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/final_sian_berry_youth_services_update_mar2017.pdf)found councils in London have faced \\xa336m in cuts to youth services since 2011, with 48% of youth worker jobs lost in that time. She said: \"I have been urging the mayor for over a year to recognise that these cuts have been having a devastating effect on young Londoners' futures and their ability to flourish.\" The fund is separate from the [\\xa37m investment the mayor has made in projects to tackle knife and gang crime](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- london-41998172) in 2017-18. It is also in addition to the \\xa315m he allocated for the Met Police's anti- knife crime initiatives in 2018-19.  ] ",

There was outrage in the Pacific nation this week after a girls' high school rugby team was withdrawn from a competition because of their gender. An official letter said that sports such as rugby and boxing went against Tongan women's dignity and culture. Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva responded by saying that the letter did not represent official government policy. He said that the government \"actively encourages the participation of every Tongan student in all sports without discrimination\".    \"It is, however, for the individual students and their parents to decide whether or not they should participate in a particular sport like rugby and boxing,\" the prime minister added.  * [Anger at Tonga women's rugby 'ban'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-43469604)  'Tongan cultural values' Earlier in the week, the Ministry of Education and Training said it had taken the decision in order to \"preserve the dignity of Tongan women and hold on to Tongan cultural values\". [The decision was widely criticised, including by Fehoko Tu'ivai, president of the Tonga Women's Rugby Association](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one- news/sport/other/womens-rights-delivered-blow-after-tonga-bans-girls-school- rugby-boxing-despite-promised-funding-injection-nz). \"How can we teach our girls to be independent when we keep making choices for them?\" she asked, quoted by TV New Zealand. But an Education Ministry official told Radio New Zealand that the decision may have been misunderstood, and that sport was being temporarily suspended in government schools after a devastating cyclone in February.  ] ",

Hundreds of schools are placed into colour-coded support categories - green, yellow, amber and red. Two thirds of secondary and more than 85% of primary schools are green and yellow, which the education secretary says \"continues with the upward trend we have seen over the past few years.\" But there are slightly more schools in red than last year.   * [A county-by-county list of green schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42903315)   * [The list of yellow rated schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42903317)   * [Amber rated schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42904685)   * [Red schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42904687)  A full breakdown which shows which of Wales' 1,547 schools are in each category has also been published [on the My Local Schools website.](http://mylocalschool.wales.gov.uk/)       * * *    Catch me up hide     Green schools require just four days worth of support to improve and yellow schools receive up to 10 days of support. There are 56 schools in the red category - judged to need the most help, up to 25 days of support. This is 10 more schools than last year.    **OVERALL SCHOOL PERFORMANCE - AT A GLANCE:**      This year, the system has been fine-tuned so rather than just performance measures such as key GCSE results, there is a broader look at how schools are doing and the quality of teaching and learning. The findings include:   * 85.3% of primary schools and 68.3% of secondary schools are now in the green and yellow categories   * There has been a 29% rise in the number of green schools, compared to last year   * There are 17 schools which have stayed in the red category (seven secondary and 10 primary) from last year   * Two areas have no red schools at all for a successive year - Merthyr and Swansea   * Pembrokeshire has the most schools - six - in the red category, including four of its high schools.   * Four areas have no green secondary schools - Anglesey, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire and Torfaen  Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said there was \"real strength\" in primary schools and she wanted to see improvements in the secondary sector, with help targeted for those schools in the red category. \"Parents should know and have confidence that those schools will have support from their local education authority, their regional consortia and those schools around them doing well,\" she said.   * [Digital learning 'not keeping pace with technology'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42791009)   * [GCSE results gap grows](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-41513404)  Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd called for a reform of the \"crude traffic light system\" and said also the Welsh Government needed to tackle the basic issues of school underfunding and recruitment. \"They also need to explain why there is continued disparity between the categorisation of schools and the outcome of Estyn inspections, which can still contradict each other,\" he added. Darren Millar, Conservative education spokesman said many of the schools rated green would not have been in the green category had they been consistent with last year's scoring tool. \"If we want an education system that competes with the best in the world, then we must be honest about the failings in Welsh schools - and work with the teaching profession and other stakeholders to solve them,\" he said.  ] ",

In a report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says the DfE does not have a coherent plan to tackle teacher retention and development.    The report says the number of qualified teachers leaving the profession - for reasons other than retirement - increased from 6% (25,260) of the qualified workforce in 2011 to 8% (34,910) in 2016. It says the issue is particularly critical in England's secondary schools, with the number of teachers falling by 10,800 (5%) between 2010 and 2016, from 219,000 to 208,200. This comes at a time when secondary school pupil numbers are set to increase by 540,000 (19%) between 2017 and 2025. \"The failure of the department to get to grips with the number of teachers leaving puts additional pressure on schools faced with rising numbers of children needing a school place and the teachers to teach them,\" the report says.  'You could work all day every day' It says workload is the main reason teachers are leaving and criticises the DfE for not setting out what impact its interventions on this matter are having. \"We do not expect the department to prescribe how many hours teachers should work but do expect it to understand and have a view on the relationship between workload and retention,\" it adds. For Jake Rusby, a heavy workload was very much an issue. \"I spent every hour either working or thinking about work - during the week and at weekends,\" he says. \"You could work all day every day pretty much and still not get everything done. \"I didn't see much of my young daughter at the time.\" Jake says that when he left the profession to set up his own business, it was a relief both for him and for his family. \"When I left, my wife said she felt like she'd got me back again,\" he says.  What does the government say? The DfE says there are record numbers of teachers in schools and that last year, 32,000 trainee teachers were recruited, in spite of a competitive labour market. \"Retention rates have been broadly stable for the past 20 years, and the teaching profession continues to be an attractive career,\" said a spokeswoman.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The DfE says it is investing in teacher recruitment  \"We are consulting on proposals to improve and increase development opportunities for teachers across the country and working with teachers, unions and Ofsted to tackle unnecessary workload with specific support for teachers at the start of their careers. \"Alongside this we continue to offer financial incentives to attract the brightest and best into our classrooms.\"  What do head teachers say? Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the PAC report was concerning, but came as no surprise. \"Anyone working in a school knows how rewarding it is to help young people learn and grow. On a good day, there's no better profession to be in,\" he said. \"The trouble is our teachers work longer hours for less money compared to their peers around the world. \"Today's graduates are attracted to other professions, and current teachers are leaving in search of other careers.\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the current situation had been \"brewing for several years\". \"Ministers spent too long in a state of denial, and having belatedly woken up to the problem have failed to put in place a coherent strategy and have focused instead on piecemeal initiatives. It has been a case of too little too late,\" he said. Mr Barton said the ASCL was keen to work with the new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, \"to solve a crisis which will become much worse - unless action is taken urgently - because pupil numbers are rising significantly and many more teachers will be needed\".  ] ",

Katie Brennan was suspended from the Australian Football League Women's (AFLW) over a rough tackle. A similar offence in the men's league would attract a fine, not a suspension. Brennan has taken her case to the Australian Human Rights Commission. League officials have denied sexism.  What was wrong with the tackle? Australian rules football is a contact sport that involves two teams of 18 people who use their feet or hands to move an oval-shaped ball.    Players tackle by wrapping their arms around an opponent and dragging them to the ground. Brennan's tackle was deemed illegal because her opponent's head hit the ground - a rule designed to prevent concussion. The opponent appeared shaken but continued playing.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Brennan tackles a player legally to the ground during a match in 2015  A tribunal ruled that Brennan had used excessive force, and banned her from leading the Western Bulldogs in the AFLW Grand Final on Saturday.  What is Brennan alleging? Brennan has asserted that her suspension is a \"fundamental breach\" of Australia's Sex Discrimination Act. She argues that AFL rules stipulate a lesser penalty in the men's game, citing incidents involving players Jack Redden and Ben Howlett last year.   * [The women's sport captivating Australia](/news/world-australia-39111312)   * [Transgender first for Australian football](/news/world-australia-43044082)  \"I believe my tackle on [opponent] Harriet Cordner was reasonable and I strongly disagree with the guilty finding,\" she said in a statement on Friday. \"It is even more troubling to know that if I was a man playing in the AFL and was reported for the identical tackle, I would not have been suspended and I would be playing in a grand final tomorrow.\"   Skip Twitter post by @Bekelauer  > Katie Brennan fighting the patriarchy by taking the AFL to the Australian Human Rights Commission on a gender discrimination basis.

AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said it was unfair to call Brennan's case an example of sexism. \"I guess I would say that in different competitions, we have different rules,\" he said on Melbourne radio station 3AW. However, he said the current rules would be reviewed. \"It will definitely be looked at, whether there's change is a different issue. I think there's a fair question to be asked there,\" he said. Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains said: \"We share Katie's view that her suspension was wrong and we will fully support her challenging the AFL rules on the basis of gender discrimination.\"  What happens now? Brennan will seek to overturn her suspension through the Australian Human Rights Commission - an independent statutory body that is government-funded. [The commission resolves matters through conciliation](http://www.humanrights.gov.au/complaint-information). There will be no outcome before Saturday, but Brennan said her main aim was to make rules consistent between AFL and AFLW. \"The fight for gender equality is as every bit as important to me as the grand final,\" she said. AFLW began as a professional competition only last year. [It has faced controversy over why its players are paid significantly less than men.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39111312)  ] ",

They can be held by poverty, sexual and domestic violence, and social stigma. But a charity, Camfed, is working to keep girls in school, in the belief that education can be the best protection against child marriage. Camfed works in Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Ghana, and says child marriage is both a consequence of poverty and perpetuates it. \"Most child brides have lost one or both parents, and face a daily struggle for food,\" explains Angeline Murimirwa, Camfed's executive director for Africa.    \"Elderly grandparents or other family members don't have the financial means to look after them, and often find themselves pushed to consider marriage as the best option for the girl.\"  Lifting families from poverty In Africa, there are 125m child brides, with 39% of all girls in the sub- Saharan region married before the age of 18. Although many families believe child marriage provides a financial benefit, it often only exacerbates the situation.  Image copyrightCamfedImage caption If girls can get an education they can increase their earnings and invest in their families  In poor communities, any spare money is often spent on sending boys to school, as they are seen as having a higher chance of securing work, and don't face the same safety risks as girls on long journeys to school. But that means families losing the earnings that could have come from keeping girls in school. Women often reinvest their earning in their families, paying to educate their children, siblings and relatives, meaning one educated girl has the potential to lift her entire family out of poverty. But when girls are married off their education usually ends there. Many child brides hope marriage will provide the opportunity to go to school, however they typically end up falling pregnant soon after, or being kept at home to carry out household chores. In sub-Saharan Africa, 75% of girls start primary school, but only 8% finish secondary school. A report from Unicef projected the number of girl brides will double by 2050 if no action is taken.  Married at 12 Gloria - not her real name - was 12 when her father died, leaving her mother to care for 10 children alone. Living in one of the poorest provinces of rural Zambia, there were few options available for the family. \"I cried because I was too young to get married,\" Gloria recalled. \"I did not want to. I did not understand the meaning of marriage. I was so scared.\"  Image copyrightCamfedImage caption Child brides can be forced into early marriage by poverty and then lack the education to support themselves and escape  After Gloria's wedding, she stopped going to school and instead had to spend her days taking care of the house and looking for work. Six months into the marriage, Gloria became pregnant, and was forced to marry her husband's brother after her husband suddenly died. Routinely subjected to domestic violence, she miscarried. A few years later, Gloria fell pregnant again, and was still carrying the baby when her second husband died, leaving her to give birth alone. \"I had no knowledge of how to deliver a baby. I delivered at home, and the neighbour heard me. That's when they came to help me.\" Like millions of other child brides, Gloria was left trapped in the poverty cycle, having left school with no qualifications. Camfed came to Gloria's aid, after hearing of her situation through its network of former students who had been supported through education by Camfed. This alumni network, the Camfed Association, was started by Angeline Murimirwa, after she became one of Camfed's first scholars.  Struggling to pay for school \"I remember wearing a torn dress to primary school, having no shoes and not enough to eat. I felt guilty when my parents sold maize to buy me school supplies and I used to wash dishes for the teacher just to get hold of a pencil,\" said Angeline. Born in Zimbabwe, Angeline's parents couldn't afford to send her to secondary school, despite her achieving one of the best exam results in the country. \"Without money for school fees or clothing, I had no hope of going, even though my mother wanted me to.\" * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [US and England pull out of Pisa tests on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42781376)   * [UK university plans to access EU funds post-Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42690438)   * [Putting university in reach of South Africa's townships](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42572139)   * [Liberia's controversial private school experiment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Investment scheme to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)? Get in touch with sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * * Camfed selected Angeline for its first support programme in Zimbabwe in 1993, and she has since risen through the ranks to executive director. Women's average earnings increase by up to 25% for each year in secondary school, and Camfed's main focus is reaching the most marginalised girls through education. So far the charity has enabled more than two million girls to go to school, and has committed to supporting one million more to attend secondary school by 2020. The charity pays school fees, and provides books, uniforms and sanitary protection - items which often present a huge barrier for rural families, even in countries where secondary education is free.  Image copyrightCamfedImage caption Camfed supports girls to keep them in school - and their former scholars help the next generation  \"We work with communities to prioritise those with the greatest need, and these people tend to be young girls,\" says Angeline. \"They're the first to drop out of school, the first to be failed by the system, they face the perils of early marriage and early pregnancy. \"Yet educating girls has the most transformational impact. Educated mothers will educate their sons and daughters, and new pathways are opened up for women in economic independence and leadership.\" Gloria is a poster girl for how education can transform a girl's life. She is now 17 and is preparing to return to school. \"When I finish I would like to be a doctor,\" she says. \"The first doctor in my community.\"  ] ",

The government's Closing The Gap report tracks targets aimed at reducing inequality between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. [Only one target was met last year.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- australia-38965545) Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the latest report showed improvement, but not in some areas - such as bridging a gap in life expectancy. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, who comprise about 3% of Australia's population, continue to experience high levels of disadvantage.    \"The last decade has given us a richer understanding about what works and what does not,\" Mr Turnbull told parliament on Monday. \"Three of the seven targets are on track this year, giving us the most promising result since 2011.\" Those targets are reducing infant mortality, enrolling more children in early childhood education, and improving high school completion rates. Among measures of continuing inequality, indigenous Australians can expect to live about 10 years less than non-indigenous Australians. Last week, a coalition of [experts accused of the government of \"effectively abandoning\" the Closing The Gap strategy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- australia-42983877) because of funding cuts. Four of the targets expire this year. The government said the policy would be revised with new goals later in 2018.  Which targets are on track?   * Halve the gap in child mortality by 2018   * Enrol 95% of four-year-old children in early education by 2025   * Halve the gap in students graduating high school by 2020  Which targets are not?   * Close the life expectancy gap by 2031   * Halve the gap in employment outcomes by 2018   * Halve the gap in literacy and numeracy by 2018   * Close the gap in school attendance by the end of 2018   ] ",

It will be run by the University of Dundee and the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI). Up to 50 places will be available on the course - aimed at graduates and people who want to change careers. The scheme is unlikely to be controversial and has been welcomed by the profession's governing body. The universities will work closely with rural schools in areas of deprivation to help deliver the 18-month course.    The new scheme will join a number of other courses which are designed to complement the main teacher training system. It was picked after a government procurement exercise to find another new route into teaching.  'Unprecedented change' Some people in the profession had been concerned in case the latest scheme would mirror Teach First south of the border which allows trainees into the classroom at an early stage. Teach First decided not to bid for this contract. The course - which will run from December 2018 to June 2020 - will be open to graduates with a minimum 2:1 honours degree in chemistry, physics, home economics, maths and engineering. The chief executive of teaching's governing body, the GTCS, Kenneth Muir said: \"This new route into teaching is a welcome addition to the range of opportunities that exist to support people to become high quality teachers. \"It offers additional flexibility while maintaining the strength and quality of input from Scottish Initial Teacher Education Universities. \"Society is changing at an unprecedented speed and the way we train and register teachers must reflect those changes. We believe this route into teaching does that and GTCS is ready to start the process of accrediting this new programme as soon as possible. \"It is important to remember, as the cabinet secretary and GTCS Council have stressed all along, any new routes into teaching must meet the high quality benchmark of the GTCS Standards for Registration in order to ensure our children and young people receive the best possible learning experiences.\"  'Extremely rewarding' The course will complement 11 other alterative routes into teaching for Scots who do not want to do a traditional postgraduate course in education followed by a probationary year. The two universities will work with schools in Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, the Borders and the Highlands. Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary, John Swinney, said: \"Teachers are the foundation of Scotland's education system and are crucial to our aspiration of closing the poverty-related attainment gap. \"We know that some areas face challenges in recruiting teachers in certain subject areas and this means that we need to think differently about how we attract new recruits into the classroom. \"This innovative proposal is designed to broaden the range of people entering the profession - providing a challenging, yet extremely rewarding, opportunity to train in rural schools within areas of high deprivation. \"Crucially, this route maintains the traditionally high standard of teaching in Scotland and I am pleased to support it with a quarter of million pounds from the Attainment Scotland Fund.\" Supporters of the scheme will be hoping it helps attract more Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) graduates into teaching and eventually helps deal with the recruitment difficulties experienced in some areas.  ] ",

New figures showed the percentage signing up for university last year was 40.7%, up from 37.8% six years ago. A total of 26.8% opted for a college course - up 0.1% on 2011/12. However, the percentage of school leavers going into training has steadily fallen from 4.5% in 2011 to 2.4% in 2016. [According to official statistics](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0053/00531988.pdf), there has been a year-on-year reduction in the percentage of leavers who are unemployed and seeking work or training.    In 2011/12, there were 8.25% who fell into this category, while in 2016/17 that figure was recorded at 4.5%. The latest figures show that almost a quarter, 22%, have taken up employed work, down slightly on the previous year but up by 2.2% on 2011/12 figures.    [Click to see content: school_destinations_scotland](//www.bbc.co.uk/indepthtoolkit/charts/school_destinations_scotland)    School leavers who are engaged in higher education, further education, training, voluntary work, employment and activity agreements are classified as having a \"positive destination\". The statisticians also say that for school leavers living in the most deprived areas, the percentage in a positive destination has increased from 83.9% in 2011/12 to 89.6% in 2016/17. For school leavers living in Scotland's most affluent areas, the percentage in a positive destination has increased from 95.1% in 2011/12 to 96.6% in 2016/17. This latest data was recorded in October 2017, approximately three months after the youngsters left school. Further and Higher Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \"It is vital that every young person leaving school has the opportunity to make the choice that is right for them - whether that be university or college, training or a job. \"Today's statistics show a record proportion of leavers in an initial positive destination and, in particular, a welcome increase to another record in those leavers from the most deprived backgrounds going on to a positive destination.\"  'Pursue radical measures' However, the Scottish Conservatives said the statistics showed that the Scottish government had made \"very little progress\" on closing the attainment gap. Their education spokeswoman, Liz Smith, said: \"The SNP has completely failed to enable the most disadvantaged children to have the same opportunities as their wealthier counterparts when they leave school. \"Higher education is not the only choice for school leavers, but these figures demonstrate that students from poorer backgrounds are much less likely to take this path. \"This has to change, the SNP must pursue the radical measures necessary to make that change.\"  ] ",

The new \"global competences\" test will be carried out alongside maths, reading and science, as part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s influential Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. But some Western countries including England, the United States, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Ireland have decided not to take the global competence test, although they will take the other core academic subject tests. Schools in Scotland, Australia and Canada are among those that will take the global competence test, which is being launched this year. The OECD's Pisa rankings have become important international benchmarks for education systems.    But the economic think tank has decided to introduce a very different kind of test, addressing the type of skills young people need to navigate a world of \"post-truth\" and social media \"echo chambers\".  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The Pisa tests are going to compare countries on how well young people can work together  The concept of global competence was intended to test how well young people were prepared to work alongside people from different cultures and with different beliefs. The test will measure tolerance, cultural awareness and how well teenagers can distinguish between reliable sources of information and fake news. It will consider issues such as racism, cultural identity and prejudice. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, said the success of education systems had to be measured on more than exam results. Speaking in London at the Education World Forum, he said there had to be a greater awareness of \"values\".  Image caption Andreas Schleicher says social media can encourage people to stay within their \"echo chambers\"  Alongside globalisation and the rise of social media, he said, there had been a \"polarisation\" in beliefs, which meant that some teenagers could be left with little awareness of the views of other people. The test is underpinned by the idea that young people should understand other cultures, show respect for \"human dignity\" and be able to objectively analyse information. The OECD has been trailing these plans for a new kind of Pisa test for the past year. But Mr Schleicher said the \"crunch\" point was that some countries were reluctant to be compared on these measures. And there had been a \"hesitation\" about moving from discussing students' beliefs to \"hard data\" from testing them. \"I take a different view. The only way to get serious, the only way to get started with this issue is to look at the truth,\" said the OECD's education chief. Mr Schleicher said that the test would reveal the countries that paid only \"lip service\" to the ideas of tolerance and inclusion. \"What do students actually think? What do students actually know? \"That's the aim of Pisa, to confront us with the real world, not the world of words and beautiful theory,\" he said. The most successful education systems were often the most open and diverse, Mr Schleicher said, giving Canada as an example. The Department for Education in England said Pisa was valued for the information it provided on schools - and that schools would continue to take the other Pisa tests, with the results and rankings to be published next year. But it said that \"like more than half of the 80 countries\" taking Pisa tests, it would not place an \"additional burden\" on schools with the new global competence test. \"All schools are already required to teach pupils to have a mutual respect and tolerance of those of different faiths and beliefs,\" said a DFE spokeswoman. But the Scottish government said it wanted to carry out a test which would help young people to \"thrive in today's world\". \"The results will help us understand how we can further support young people to be responsible global citizens, capable of taking part in local, regional and global decision making and debate,\" said the Scottish government spokeswoman. The OECD says that there are still likely to be changes to the countries participating, but at present there will be 28 countries in the inaugural rankings on global competences - and a further 24 countries will gather data, without students taking the test. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [UK university could access EU funds post-Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42690438)   * [UK exports university ambition scheme to South Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42572139)   * [Liberia's big school experiment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42413639)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Helping to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * [Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)?

Liberia, which [elected a new president last week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news /world-africa-42507405), has among the highest percentage of out-of-school primary children in the world.  **In a bid to improve the availability and quality of schools, the West African country has been carrying out a controversial experiment.**  **It has asked a range of non-government organisations to run some of the country's state schools, to see how results compare.**  **Supporters defend this as bold innovation which will raise standards. Opponents say it is a pathway to privatising the state school system.**  **David Laws, a former education minister in England and executive chairman of the Education Partnerships Group, has been advising Liberia's government on the project. He gives his views on the findings so far.**    * * * \"Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world and its education system lags behind most countries, in both access and quality. Fewer than 40% of children complete primary education. And among adult women who finished elementary school just one in four could read a sentence.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The results of the school experiment are being monitored by international researchers  If you were education minister in such a country, you might be tempted to try a big, bold, experiment - and that is exactly what the government has done, with Liberia's high profile and sometimes controversial Partnership Schools for Liberia programme. Liberian ministers, including Education Minister Werner, last year decided to transfer the management of 93 government schools to eight private operators - mostly international school groups, but also some home grown operators. These 93 schools remained state schools - with government teachers, open enrolment, and no fees. For those who think this sounds like the academies programme which has been rolled out in England - well, you're right. Except that it took England seven years to grow its academies programme to the size Liberia achieved overnight. And, perhaps unlike in England, Liberian ministers decided to do something else just as bold - they would support a rigorous, independent, evaluation of their own policy.  How to measure the impact? Alongside the 93 privately-managed government schools would be a similar number of government \"control\" schools, to test whether the private operators were genuinely doing better. Instead of the government marking its own homework, researchers from the Center for Global Development in Washington DC and the University of California at San Diego oversaw a selected sample of 3,499 students in 185 schools.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Liberia has one of the world's biggest problems in the lack of school places  As the evaluators fanned out across Liberia, navigating unmade roads and swollen rivers, the international controversy about the so-called \"PSL\" programme began to hot up. Supporters of public-private partnerships claimed that the improved private sector management would inevitably raise results. Others claimed that education was being \"privatised\", and that improvements would fail to emerge or not be sustainable across the whole school system.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Supporters of George Weah celebrated his presidential election victory last week  When I visited the country last year, the potential for improvement was clearly visible - many of the PSL schools, for example, reporting that they were now able to take action to replace the teachers who had failed to turn up for classes, when the government was running the schools. But the scale of the challenge was also clear - and the new operators had been given limited notice of which schools and how many they were going to be taking on.  What are the results so far? The first year of \"PSL\" is now complete, and the results from the initial evaluation of the programme are in. What do they show? For the supporters of the \"Partnership Schools\", there are some pretty impressive statistics. Students in these schools made learning gains of more than half an extra year of schooling in English, and two thirds of an extra year in maths - versus the government schools.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The experiment also raises questions about funding levels for pupils in Liberia  On average learning gains were 60% higher in partnership schools in the experiment compared with the government schools being used as a control. Teachers in the Partnership schools were 20% more likely to be in school during a random spot check (from a dreadful baseline figure of just 40% in comparator government schools), while students spent roughly twice as long learning each week. So does this prove the case for the reformers? Should the government not simply turn over the whole system to private operators? Sadly, it's not quite as simple as that. The PSL schools did better, but they also received more money. On top of the usual government budget of a mere $50 (\\xa337) per child per year, PSL schools received an additional allocation from external funders/operators of at least $50 more per child. Indeed, the evaluators estimate some operators spent a lot more than that - around $663 (\\xa3480) per child in one case. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)   * [Helping to keep girls in school in India](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42253676)   * [Next Pisa tests will rank countries on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42318895)   * [Egyptian mummy's secrets revealed in hi-tech lab](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42218032)   * [The nursery in Amsterdam's red light district](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42143635)   * [From $50 in his pocket to a $500,000 education prize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41963896)   * [Terror survivor campaigns for open speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41899753)  Ideas for the [Global education series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15838288)? Get in touch with sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * * Now, some of these costs may be particularly high at the beginning of the programme, and could come down over time. But the programme can only be regarded as fully scaleable if the government can substantially increase its own education spending, or encourage donors to fill the yawning gap. What else? Well, the evaluators found that government assigned 37% more teachers to PSL schools than non PSL schools, including first pick of better- trained, new, graduates. If this programme is to be scaled up across all Liberia's schools, then a big increase in the supply of trained teachers will be necessary.  What are the lessons? So, must we conclude that little can be learned from the Liberian experiment? This seems to be too pessimistic. Indeed, it's interesting that while learning gains differed widely across the eight operators, these gains did not necessarily correlate with the higher spending.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The experiment in Liberia has been the focus of international attention  One of the lowest cost operators achieved one of the best results for student learning. That suggests that the improvement in education may not just be about pouring in lots of money. There could be other gains in management and teaching practice, that do not require such large dollops of extra cash. Liberia's experiment in school reform is still in its early days - with two more years of evaluation to go. We know from experience elsewhere that programme impacts can vary significantly over time. Liberia also needs to make sure that it can manage and hold to account private operators, in a country with limited government capacity. But for education reformers worldwide and for the children of Liberia, this has been a promising intervention - the challenge is now to build up government capacity and bring down costs. Both are likely to be necessary if a promising experiment can truly change the face of Liberian education.\"  _David Laws was Schools Minister in England from 2012-2015.

The HumanDrive initiative will first simulate a range of conditions, before the car starts its 200-mile (320km) journey in December 2019. The UK wants to get driverless cars on the road by 2021. But it is facing stiff competition from the US and other countries around the world. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark welcomed the project: \"Low-carbon and self-driving vehicles are the future and they are going to drive forward a global revolution in mobility.    \"Trailblazing projects like the HumanDrive project will play a vital role helping us deliver on that ambition.\"  Image copyrightCatapultImage caption The car will have to deal with winding roads as well as other challenging conditions  The project is a collaboration between Groupe Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, Cranfield University and Highways England, among others. Mark Westwood, chief technology officer of the Transport Systems Catapult, which is another partner involved in the project, said: \"UK roads throw up some particular challenges. They are different from American roads, with roundabouts and demanding country lanes. These are really testing environments. \"This project is about advancing the state of the art and trying to do something more demanding. The control system will learn to drive like a human.\" To enable this, a group of competent human drivers will show off their skills in a simulator based at Leeds University and the data will be collated. Data is also being collected from roads around the UK. This will be fed into the machine learning system and driverless cars will begin safety testing and trials on private tracks. Waymo - owned by Google's parent firm Alphabet - has already begun trials of a taxi that has no driver to step in if things go wrong. The firm intends the test, in Arizona, to eventually cover an area the size of Greater London. The division has already carried out 3.5 million miles of other tests on US public roads. And Uber recently struck a deal to buy 24,000 self-driving cars from Volvo and plans to radically expand its current tests in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Most car firms, including Toyota, Nissan, BMW and Ford, also have ambitious timelines to get fully autonomous vehicles on the roads by 2020 or 2021.  ] ",

He said \"hard Brexiteers\" had dragged the Conservatives to the right, while Jeremy Corbyn had moved Labour left. \"I don't believe that the moderate, pro-business, socially liberal, internationalist part of the British people has disappeared,\" he said. He spoke alongside former prime minister Tony Blair who warned of politics based on \"shouting loudest\". The two former political opponents, speaking together at an international education conference, warned of a polarised political culture.     'Re-thinking' the centre The centre ground was where general elections used to be fought and won, Mr Osborne told the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai. The middle ground might have been eroded by the financial crisis and by divisions over Brexit said Mr Osborne. But he argued that it was where many voters still remained. The former chancellor said that Labour would be far ahead in the polls with a more moderate leader. Mr Blair said the culture of \"building bridges\" in politics seemed to have been lost. Instead he warned that party politics reflected the type of polarisation and taking of extreme views found on social media. \"Those of use in the centre are going to have to do a lot of re-thinking,\" said the former Labour leader.  'Eccentric' White House On threats from Russia and the rising economic power of China, Mr Blair warned that \"liberal democracy\" would face growing challenges. He called for the US to be much clearer in its defence of western democratic \"values\". But Mr Osborne said that unity between Western allies had become much more difficult under an \"eccentric\" and \"unpredictable\" Trump administration, with a high turnover of senior staff. \"It is very difficult for America's allies,\" said Mr Osborne. On the diplomatic row with Russia following the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, the former Conservative chancellor said it was important to send out a \"tough response\". But he labelled as \"disgraceful\" the way that the Labour leader appeared to distance himself from the government's claims over Russian involvement. Mr Osborne also revealed another connection with Mr Blair. He said during Mr Blair's time in Downing Street, Mr Osborne used to rehearse Conservative leaders getting ready to face prime ministers' questions in the House of Commons - and in those exchanges Mr Osborne played the part of Mr Blair.  ] ",

The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would consider whether further action is required based on the corporation's response. Ms Gracie, who has alleged \"unlawful pay discrimination\", thanked the EHRC for \"demanding facts on BBC pay\". The BBC said \"fairness in pay\" was \"vital\" to the corporation. In a statement, the EHRC said: \"Women have a legal right to equal pay with men for equal work.\"    The watchdog said it was aware of Ms Gracie's claims and would write to the BBC, \"requiring them to provide us with information on their pay policy and the facts in this individual case\". It added: \"We will consider whether further action is required based on this information.\" It said a [new requirement for thousands of firms to report on gender pay gaps](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42580194) would \"do more to end discrimination\" in the workplace.   * [Reality Check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem?](/news/uk-42611725)   * [Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms](/news/uk-42580194)   ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05t7mqz.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionEmployment lawyer: Carrie Gracie \"very clear\" she did not want to be paid more, but wanted equality Ms Gracie, who is returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London, has worked at the BBC for 30 years and led its China coverage since 2014.

She said she had refused a \\xa345,000 rise as it still left a \"big gap\" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be \"made equal\". In an [open letter,](http://carriegracie.com/news.html) Ms Gracie said the issue was about \"men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal\".    The BBC has conducted a judge-led audit of the pay of most of its staff, which showed no systemic discrimination, and has commissioned accountancy firm PWC to carry out a separate review of on-air staff, which will be published \"shortly\". A BBC spokesman said: \"The BBC was one of the first to publish a gender pay report showing we are significantly better than the national average.\" Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight, employment lawyer Jennifer Millins, who represents several women taking cases against the corporation, said Ms Gracie's case may \"give some answers\" to other complainants.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05t5n1k.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionCarrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor Up to 200 women at various levels of the BBC have made complaints about pay, according to BBC Women, a group of about 150 broadcasters and producers. Sian Kevill, the former director of BBC World News, said she was \"quite shocked\" at the pay disparity between international editors. \"When you have the same job title, it does seem to denote that you have roughly the same salary,\" she told Newsnight. But she added that pay could be \"very tricky\" if someone is hired externally, but has higher pay because they work in a competitive field or have worked in warzones, for example.  ] ",

The corporation's former China editor Carrie Gracie resigned, saying there had been \"unlawful pay discrimination\". In his first day in the job, Matthew Hancock told MPs that \"brilliant women working at all levels of the BBC deserve better\" and pledged to hold it to account. The BBC says it is an issue it needs \"to resolve swiftly and get right\". The comments came as the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it would write to the BBC before it considered whether further action was required.      * [Radio 4 host off air after pay gap tweet](/news/entertainment-arts-42623068)   * [Reality Check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem?](/news/uk-42611725)   * [Watchdog asks BBC for Carrie Gracie facts](/news/uk-42616152)   * [How to discuss equal pay at work](/newsbeat/articles/42609513)  Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said salary figures must be scrutinised in comparison with others in the public service. \"Working for the BBC is public service and a great privilege, yet some men at the BBC are paid far more than other, equivalent public servants. \"This isn't just a matter of levelling women's pay up. It's a matter of pay equality.\" Amid the row, Labour MP Jess Phillips asked for assurances women would not be \"silenced\" over the issue at work. She questioned why BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis had been allowed to talk about gender pay on-air, after tweeting about it, while other female colleagues had not. Earlier, the BBC replaced a presenter on Radio 4's You and Yours programme - citing impartiality issues - after Winifred Robinson tweeted support for Carrie Gracie.  Gracie to give evidence Chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee Maria Miller said the broadcaster needed to \"act and act quickly\". She questioned the success of the BBC's internal review and asked why the EHRC has \"failed to intervene\". BBC director general Tony Hall has been asked to meet the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee to discuss how the broadcaster will address the gender pay gap. [The committee said in a tweet that Carrie Gracie would give evidence](https://twitter.com/CommonsCMS/status/950743518909288448) to MPs on the issue. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said despite the spotlight being shone on gender pay \"there is still a very long way to go\". The BBC is expected to publish a review of on-air staff salaries at the end of the month and says \"fairness in pay\" is \"vital\" to the corporation. Mr Hall has committed to closing the gap by 2020 but the culture secretary said the government \"will watch closely [and]...hold him to that\". As a publicly funded broadcaster, Mr Hancock said the BBC needed to \"uphold and be a beacon of value and of fairness\". The BBC's recently appointed head of news, Fran Unsworth, said pay equality was a priority for the corporation. \"Pay is an issue that we need to resolve swiftly and get right. The public holds us to higher standards than other organisations. We must hold ourselves to those standards too. \"While a significant number of organisations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing better than many - we need to go further. \" [In October, a report found that men working for the BBC earned 9.3% more than women on average](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41497265) compared with an average differential across the UK of 18%. Former shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman praised Ms Gracie's \"principled\" stance for women inside and outside her industry. Ms Harman added: \"As a broadcaster and a journalist she is exceptional, but as a woman facing entrenched pay discrimination, I'm afraid she is the norm.\"  ] ",

She went on to get a teaching qualification and now she's running education courses trying to help adults without qualifications, without jobs and often drained of self-confidence. Maxine is speaking at Mowbray Gardens Library in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where a group is gathering for lessons taught by the Workers Educational Association (WEA), the largest voluntary sector provider of adult education. There are ex-miners here who haven't worked since the pits closed in the 1980s.     Image caption \"We all need respect. Everyone should have a chance,\" says Shane  When Maxine left school in the 1970s, she says working class youngsters were expected to go straight into factories, mines or the steelworks. They didn't need to take exams. \"Maths may as well have been taught in Martian language,\" she says.  'A kind of malaise' But those industries have declined and communities have been left behind. \"There's a kind of malaise that falls over like a blanket. It's really hard to break through,\" says Maxine, who found her own way back into learning through the WEA, where she became a tutor.   There have been endless policy announcements and glossy strategies about improving vocational skills and helping people to retrain. But how does that really translate at the sharp end? It's tough enough for people with qualifications - imagine what it's like without any exams and your only work experience is in jobs that no longer exist. \"We all need respect. Everyone should have a chance,\" says Shane, who is part of the student group.  Image caption \"I felt like a proper lost cause,\" says Laura  He doesn't want anyone looking down their noses at people trying to find work or training for a fresh start. Students talk of feeling \"belittled\" by an often faceless online application process. These are the disenfranchised white, working class. Not working, but at least back in class.  'Communities aren't there any more' At the weekly lesson, they're being taught IT skills that could help them write an application letter, put together a CV or find ways to access information online. It's also about working as a group.  Image caption The classes are run each week in the library in Rotherham  There are repeated comments about the threat of social isolation in areas where there are shrinking numbers of shared places to be together. \"People lived, drank, worked together. But those communities aren't there any more,\" says Maxine. Richard, in his 40s, says he'd been living more or less like a \"recluse\", sometimes struggling with depression and finding it difficult to get out of the house. This WEA class had given him a sense of purpose and friendship, as well as learning. The need for retraining is profound.  North-south divide In Rotherham, 12% of the working-age population have no qualifications - in Surrey it's 4%, in parts of London it's too low to be measured. It's a problem that is markedly worse across the north of England compared with the south.   London represents the other end of the spectrum, with the [highest concentration of graduates anywhere in Europe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37158445). For those who find work in Rotherham, the typical full-time annual salary in the town is about \\xa325,600. The news agenda has been focused on value for money for university students, but it's those without qualifications who are almost twice as likely not to be working.   * [Could you cope with eight different jobs a week?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/43145319)   * [Schools 'must do more to promote construction jobs'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42976991)   * [What do children draw when asked about their future jobs?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-42735095/what-do-children-draw-when-asked-about-their-future-jobs)  The WEA runs 8,000 adult courses per year - with a very different social profile from the debate about university access. Among their students, almost half have no or almost no qualifications, almost 40% live in the most deprived areas, a quarter have health problems and 12% have mental health difficulties. But it's also where education can make the biggest difference.  Image copyrightPAImage caption Miners' strike in south Yorkshire: The industries and communities have disappeared  Research into the impact of WEA courses has shown big improvements in employability and positive benefits for those with mental health conditions. Parents reported being more confident with helping their own children to learn. However, it's an uphill struggle. Inside the library there are three separate adult education courses taking place, but the back windows seem to be pitted with what look like air-rifle impacts. Whether or not that's the cause, it seems an appropriate metaphor for people trying to improve but being assailed from every side.  Parents learning together In York, another WEA group is gathering. This might be an historic, picturesque city, but it's a tourist economy with lots of insecure, low-paid work. Its schools have the lowest level of per pupil funding in England.  Image caption Parents in York are returning to learning themselves through projects in schools  The group here are taking part in a project where parents learn about helping in school and are encouraged to improve their own skills. \"When you've got a child, but you don't have the financial backing, it's very difficult to get training,\" says Annemarie. \"I struggled at school with the academic stuff, my self-esteem was very low. I felt stupid. That's what I told myself. I stopped trying because it felt so hard to try.\" But she says her confidence has been reinvigorated by her return to lessons.

I was shy, this awkward person. I felt like a proper lost cause,\" says Laura, also on the Helping In Schools course. \"I left school when I was 14, I didn't gain any GCSEs. I thought this is me, this is all I have to offer. \"But with this course, I've proved I can still do something. \"Now I feel like I can go on to other things.\"  Image caption Richard says there are many people who have little chance of work and are living like \"recluses\"  Applying for jobs left her filled with a sense of \"not being good enough\". \"You think you're going to be turned down straight away.\" She spent a long time in her flat, not going out. There are many people like her, she says, \"going under the radar\". Now she wants to work with children and is going to study how to help with special educational needs.  Image caption Catherine says it was once much easier to get jobs without qualifications  The students and their tutors say the barriers to learning are often practical. Courses can cost too much or the lack of transport can make them out of reach. Affordable childcare can be the key to returning to learning. Again and again these students mention the need for confidence and to make learning seem less daunting. Another student, Catherine, says it used to be much easier to get jobs without qualifications, but now they need to have exams. \"People can do it if they get help,\" says Laura. \"They throw the tablets at you, but this has helped me more than any medication. \"I feel like my life's been turned around. I want to keep on learning now.\"  ] ",

Jobs in Dundee are most at risk from the rise of robot labour, with Edinburgh and Aberdeen better placed to adapt to the changes ahead, it said. [The Cities Outlook report](http://www.centreforcities.org/event/cities- outlook-2018/) is an annual health-check of city economies and this year highlighted the potential impact of automation and globalisation. It said 1 in 5 posts in Scottish cities could be displaced by 2030. The rise of the robots could even compound Britain's north-south divide, the report warned.    Centre for Cities produces the annual report, which predicts that 3.6 million jobs in total might be made obsolete by 2030 - with retail occupations, customer service roles and warehouse jobs among those most at threat. Of the total 230,000 Scottish jobs at risk, this includes 112,700 jobs in Glasgow, 60,800 in Edinburgh, 35,900 in Aberdeen, and 20,000 in Dundee. Dundee is among the top ten British cities most exposed with Edinburgh and Aberdeen also at risk of job losses.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Retail is an area where automation could take over  Cities Outlook 2018 also examines potential jobs growth in British cities which could result from automation and globalisation over the coming decades: In all Scottish cities, around 9% of existing jobs are in occupations predicted to grow in future. The emergence of new industries will create new jobs which do not currently exist - just as the rise of sectors such as the IT industry did over the past century, it said. In Edinburgh and Aberdeen job losses in some sectors could be offset by an upswing in high-skilled jobs as a result of automation and globalisation. In both cities, more than a third of the jobs predicted to grow are in high skilled private sector occupations, while 29% and 22% are in low skilled private sector roles in Edinburgh and Aberdeen respectively.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Automation is set to be extended in many industries  In contrast, more than a third of the jobs set to grow in Dundee (35%) are in low skilled private sector occupations. In Glasgow, the number of low skilled jobs set to grow (27%) is also higher than the number of high skilled jobs (25%). Commenting on these findings, Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: \"Automation and globalisation will bring huge opportunities to increase prosperity and jobs, but there is also a real risk that many people in Scottish cities will lose out. \"The time to act is now - national and local leaders need to ensure that people in cities across Scotland can share in the benefits these changes could offer. \"That means reforming the education system to give young people the cognitive and interpersonal skills they need to thrive in the future, and improving school standards, especially in places where jobs are most at risk. \"We also need greater investment in lifelong learning and technical education to help adults adapt to the changing labour market, and better retraining for people who lose their jobs because of these changes. \"It's also increasingly clear that a one-size-fits-all approach from central government is inadequate to address the myriad issues that different places face.\"  ] ",

Amanda Spielman said some community leaders see schools as vehicles to \"indoctrinate impressionable minds\" - with extremist ideology in some cases. Ofsted inspectors are increasingly coming into contact with such extremists, she said. She is asking head teachers to confront those who foster extremist behaviour. It comes after an east London head teacher who tried to stop girls under the age of eight from wearing a hijab in the classroom was subjected to a campaign of abuse.    \"Rather than adopting a passive liberalism that says anything goes, for fear of causing offence, schools leaders should be promoting a muscular liberalism,\" Ms Spielman has said at a conference held by the Church of England in London.   * [Should there be more Muslim state schools?](/news/education-37484358)   * [How the Islamic veil has divided opinion across Europe](/news/world-europe-13038095)  \"That sort of liberalism holds no truck for ideologies that seek to close minds or narrow opportunity. \"Occasionally that will mean taking uncomfortable decisions or having tough conversations. \"It means not assuming that the most conservative voices in a particular faith speak for everyone.\" She added: \"Ofsted inspectors are increasingly brought into contact with those who want to actively pervert the purpose of education. \"Under the pretext of religious belief, they use education institutions, legal and illegal, to narrow young people's horizons, to isolate and segregate, and in the worst cases to indoctrinate impressionable minds with extremist ideology. \"Freedom of belief in the private sphere is paramount, but in our schools it is our responsibility to tackle those who actively undermine fundamental British values or equalities law.\"  'Tough decisions' Ms Spielman has previously criticised practices in supplementary schools and some private faith schools. She was understood to be making the speech in support of head teacher Neena Lall, of St Stephen's state primary in east London, who tried to prevent children under the age of eight from wearing the hijab in class. Generally speaking, Muslim girls, although not all of them, wear the hijab after the age of 10. Ms Lall also tried to stop younger pupils from taking part in Ramadan fasting during school hours.  'Campaign of abuse' This prompted a backlash from some members of the local community and parents, although many parents voiced support for the move. Ms Spielman said: \"School leaders must have the right to set school uniform policies in a way that they see fit, in order to promote cohesion. \"It is a matter of deep regret that this outstanding school has been subject to a campaign of abuse by some elements within the community. \"I want to be absolutely clear - Ofsted will always back heads who take tough decisions in the interests of their pupils.\" Ofsted said Ms Spielman was not targeting the Islamic faith, but all forms of fundamentalism.  'Little temptresses' Dr Zubaida Haque, of the Runnymede Trust, told BBC News head teachers' attempts to ban the wearing of hijabs or other religious items in schools could contradict British values Ofsted was trying to promote, including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. She said that in most cases young girls wore the hijab because they wanted to be like their mothers. It was not an issue of safeguarding and there had been no consultation with Muslim communities, she added. A Department for Education official said: \"Extremism has no place in our society - that's why we changed the law and the requirements on schools so that they have to actively promote the 'fundamental British values' of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and the mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. \"If there are any allegations of schools promoting ideologies or discrimination in the classroom, we will not hesitate to take action.\" Shaista Gohir, who chairs Muslim Women's Network UK, said: \"The rising phenomenon of primary-school-aged girls wearing the hijab is certainly not an issue to trivialise. \"In continuing to defend this practice, what messages are being sent to these girls about their hair and body? \"Are we telling them they are little temptresses if they don't cover up?\" * * *  Analysis by Hannah Richardson By wading into the thorny area of who should and should not wear a hijab, the Ofsted chief inspector may have inadvertently opened an old wound Secular organisations, and in particular schools across Europe, have long grappled with this item of Muslim dress. The veil is unique in that it is viewed as a symbol of multi-culturalism, sexism, coercion, women's liberation and community division all at once. The focus here may be on young children's approach to this special piece of cloth. And the majority of Muslim girls do not adopt the hijab before the age of 10. But is it the role of a head teacher to dictate who should and who should not be allowed to wear such an item? Even if they are in charge of uniform policies. By calling on head teachers to exercise a \"muscular liberalism\" in the face of ultra-conservative forces, she may yet stir up more opposition than she anticipated. * * *  ] ",

For the first time private and public bodies have been instructed to publish the difference between what their male and female employees earn. But with the final 4 April deadline looming, many of them appear to be holding back until the last minute. Fewer than 4,000 out of 9,000 have so far published the required data. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said firms were now in the \"last chance saloon\" over the issue.    All companies with more than 250 staff must publish the difference between the median hourly pay of men and that of women at their firm by 4 April. Public sector bodies face an earlier deadline of 30 March. The EHRC said it would instigate enforcement action on 9 April, which could lead to legal action and an \"unlimited fine\" set by the courts.   * [Find out the pay gap where you work](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43470827)   * [Why do schools have a massive pay gap?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43460998)   * [What is the gender pay gap?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42918951)  \"The clock is ticking and with just 10 days to go, those who haven't reported really are entering the last chance saloon,\" said Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC. She warned that companies that did not comply should \"be prepared for serious reputational damage\" and \"a very unhappy workforce\". The data published so far indicate divergent picture. A higher pay gap indicates a workplace where men dominate the senior or better paid roles. The gap between men's and women's median hourly pay at a national level is 18.4%. But several companies, including Lloyds, Virgin Money, RBS, and Clydesdale Bank have reported pay gaps in excess of 30%.   In the aviation sector Thomson Airways, TUI, Easyjet and Jet2 published median pay gaps over 45%. Across the industry men dominate well-remunerated pilot roles. The public sector has also thrown up some wide disparities. At least 10 schools and several academy trusts have a median pay gap of more than 50%. MPs have questioned whether the scheme to highlight disparities is working effectively. Next month the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee is launching an inquiry which will examine the issue as well as executive pay as well as the gender pay gap in the private sector. Some law and accountancy firms were criticised for leaving out highly paid partners when calculating their gender pay gaps. Rachel Reeves who chairs the committee said: \"Transparency on gender pay is only the beginning. We need to examine why these pay gaps persist, why within the same sector there may be companies with wildly differing pay-gaps, and what remedies are needed to tackle them.\" The Fawcett Society said that in addition to fairness for staff, employers themselves were losing out by not addressing the issue of gender imbalance in the workplace. \"The gender pay gap represents a productivity gap. It's bad for women who lose out on potential earnings and career opportunities but also bad for businesses who are failing to properly recruit, promote and reward women,\" said Jemima Olchawski, head of policy and insight at the Fawcett Society. She said pay gap reporting should provide firms with an opportunity to understand and address why it was happening at their organisation.

He will replace Justine Greening, who is leaving the government. Ms Greening, the first comprehensive-educated Tory education secretary, refused a switch to the Department for Work and Pensions, the BBC understands. Mr Hinds, a former DWP minister, went to a Catholic grammar school in Altrincham and then studied at the University of Oxford.  School funding The MP for East Hampshire is a former chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility.    Mr Hinds wrote on Twitter that he was \"looking forward to working with the great teachers and lecturers in our schools, colleges and universities giving people the opportunities to make the most of their lives\".  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Justine Greening had turned down a move to the Department for Work and Pensions  The incoming education secretary will face pressures over school funding and decisions about university tuition fees. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said he was disappointed to see Ms Greening's departure. \"She has tried hard to tackle the school funding crisis, without any help from the chancellor or prime minister,\" said Mr Barton. Jules White, a [West Sussex head teacher who co-ordinated letters sent to 2.5 million parents over school funding concerns](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41417313), says too often schools policy has been sidetracked by \"dubious ideological pursuits\" or \"tinkering around the edges\". Mr White said Mr Hinds would have to \"urgently address\" core problems over school funding and teacher shortages.  University challenges The National Association of Head Teachers called for more stability and investment. \"Where budgets are at breaking point and recruitment is still a massive challenge, education does not need more upheaval,\" said NAHT leader Paul Whiteman. School funding proved to be an important doorstep issue in the election - and Ms Greening announced that an [extra \\xa31.3bn of the education department's budget would be moved to schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40634472). The new education secretary also faces big decisions over higher education, including the future of tuition fees and university funding. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised there will be a [major review of how students pay for university](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42143632) \\- after pledges from Labour to young voters that they would scrap tuition fees. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said Mr Hinds had \"assiduously\" raised social mobility since becoming an MP in 2010.  Grammar schools Ms Greening had made [social mobility](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42343540) the focus of her 18 months in office and had built bridges with the teaching profession. But there had been questions about whether her approach aligned with the priorities of 10, Downing Street and whether her schools policy was connecting with the public. The Conservatives' flagship policy of bringing back grammar schools was abandoned in the wake of the election. There was said to be backbench disquiet that the push for more selection had been sidelined - and there will be scrutiny of whether Mr Hinds, a former grammar school boy, will be more sympathetic. Mr Hinds will also have to tackle the delayed decision on whether to change the rules to make it easier for faith groups to open free schools, pledged in the Conservatives' election manifesto. With the focus on Brexit, there was no education legislation in the last Queen's Speech. And the incoming education secretary will be expected to re-energise the Conservatives' plans for schools. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Ms Greening had been \"pushed out\", adding: \"The only rational explanation would be that this is an acknowledgement that the Conservatives have a failed schools policy.\"  ] ",

But why are poor black Americans so much more optimistic than their white counterparts? America has seen a dramatic increase in the number of so-called \"deaths of despair\". Caused by opioid addiction, alcohol or drug overdose and suicide, these deaths have hit middle-aged white people without a college education particularly hard. The trend is extensive enough to have driven up the overall mortality rate, with the US in the unusual position of being a rich country where [life expectancy is falling rather than going up](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- us-canada-42452733). Amid all this is a perhaps unexpected reality - [the people who are most optimistic about their future are the most disadvantaged: poor black Americans](https://www.brookings.edu/books/happiness-for-all/), who are even slightly more optimistic than rich black people.    And by poor, we mean a household of four earning less than $24,000 (\\xa316,800) per year, which is effectively the official US poverty line. Very different outlooks are revealed when black and white people are asked about their wellbeing. To measure the differences, we use an 11-point scale, where 0 is desperate and 10 is very optimistic.   On this scale, black people are, on average, 1.1 points higher on the optimism scale than white people are. Black people on average score above 8, while the average for white people is 7. The gap across poor black people and poor white people is even larger, at 1.4 points. That is a significant gulf - greater than the difference between rich and poor people, which is 0.6 points. The average score for rich people is 7.5, while for poor people it is 6.9. The starkest disparity is found in the detail that poor black people are almost three times as likely to be a point higher on the optimism scale than poor white people. And poor black people are half as likely to report experiencing stress the previous day than poor white people.   Desperation, stress and worry are closely [linked to a greater risk of premature death](https://www.brookings.edu/research/unequal-hopes-and-lives- in-the-u-s/), regardless of income or race.   * [Who are the poor Americans?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41930107)   * [The time when America stopped being great](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41826022)   * [Five ways to tackle the opioid epidemic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40479686)   * [Smack in the suburbs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37224075)  People with low levels of optimism and high levels of stress and worry are more likely to die from deaths of despair, or to live in areas with high levels of such deaths. The link is strongest for poor white people without a college education, especially those who live in rural areas.  Image copyrightGetty Images Of course, this relationship can run both ways. Desperation can lead to premature death, but living in an area where many such deaths occur can itself be a potential cause of lack of hope, stress, and worry. The link between optimism and longevity is strong. Among Americans born between 1935 and 1945, those who reported higher levels of optimism as young adults were much more likely to be alive in 2015 than less optimistic people. We found that 86% of pessimists died by 2015, while only 77% of the optimists did. The explanations for these trends are complex, but economics and ambition play a part. For many years, blue-collar white people had some advantages over minorities, but they are now among the most disaffected parts of society and the most vulnerable to deaths of despair.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined considerably in recent decades  Crucially, they are much more likely to report that their lives are worse than those of their parents and, in terms of stable employment and status, that is often the case. In contrast, [black and Hispanic people are more likely to report that their lives are better than their parents' lives](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/opinion/why-are-white-death-rates- rising.html). While disadvantage and discrimination still exist, minorities have been making gradual progress in narrowing gaps with white people in terms of their education, wages, and life expectancy. Some of this is because of concrete gains made by those communities. But much of the improvement is due to the relative decline in the incomes and status of poor white people - [a trend associated with the hollowing-out of blue-collar jobs, which are decreasing in both number and stability](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42581933) at the same time as the market for high-skilled labour continues to prosper and grow. The [health implications](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-17 /extraordinary-stress-and-pessimism-take-a-grim-toll) of this have been particularly serious.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Millions of Americans without medical insurance rely on mobile health clinics  White people without a college education are much more likely to die prematurely of preventable deaths than any other group. They also report more pain, stress, and anger than other parts of society. Another factor appears to be higher levels of resilience among poor minorities. For example, black and Hispanic people [are much less likely than white people to report depression or commit suicide](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00040/full). Some of this may be due to resilience built up over generations of hardship - as seen in many poor countries. Informal safety nets may also play a role - such as the community surrounding black churches and extended Hispanic families. However, this does not mean that poor black people are entirely happy with their situation.  Image copyrightGetty Images Despite reporting high levels of optimism, this group was [much less likely to report feeling safe in their neighbourhoods, or to be satisfied with their financial situations](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20171492&&from=f), than their white counterparts. There are also gaps in what we know about resilience - in particular how optimism varies between different places. For example, after adjusting for differences such as education and employment, the minority groups with the [highest levels of optimism and the lowest levels of stress in the US are in the southern states](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-geography-of-desperation-in- america).    This may seem surprising, as these same places have a historical association with racism and still have extensive poverty and poor health. Yet they also have a strong sense of black culture and community: factors that are difficult to measure but undoubtedly important. It is a picture similar to the strong sense of community and culture that helps explain why Latin Americans report higher levels of happiness than those in regions with comparable or higher incomes. A better understanding of resilience may be as important as a greater insight into the causes of desperation. It might also be that we could learn a great deal from better monitoring of wellbeing and the health of society. Other countries, including the UK, regularly track wellbeing, with life satisfaction, smiling, stress, and a sense of purpose in life all included among annual statistics. Routinely collecting such figures in the US could be a simple first step towards better understanding where things have gone wrong for some parts of society. And why some people are so much more optimistic than others.  _Correction 29 January 2018: An earlier version of this story stated that poor black people were 1.1 points higher on the optimism scale than poor white people. Dr Carol Graham has since clarified that they are actually 1.4 points higher._    **About this piece** This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from [Carol Graham](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/carol-graham/), Leo Pasvolsky senior fellow and research director at [the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu), a non-profit public policy organisation based in Washington, DC.

The Centre for Cities estimates that by 2030 nine areas could lose more than a quarter of jobs to automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Roles in shops, administration and warehouses are the most at risk. The government has said it is committed to helping people secure \"the jobs of tomorrow\" with a national retraining scheme. And it said developing AI could [create a net increase of 80,000 jobs a year ](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664563 /industrial-strategy-white-paper-web-ready-version.pdf)in countries with a population the size of the UK.    The Centre for Cities claims that by 2030 more than three million jobs across Great Britain could be lost as robots and AI technology are used more widely in the workplace. [What is an AI?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-34224406/what-is- artificial-intelligence) [Robot automation will \"take 800 million jobs by 2030\"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42170100) The report predicts towns and cities with a \"lower share of high-skilled jobs\", such as Mansfield, Sunderland and Wakefield, face losing nearly 30% of their current roles. The think tank said sales assistants and cashiers accounted for about one in every six of the jobs at risk in Mansfield, while one in 10 posts at risk were in \"elementary storage\" roles such as warehouses, both of which are predicted to see big changes from robotics and AI. In Sunderland, almost one in five jobs at risk are in retail and one in eight are in customer services.   Areas with more higher-skilled jobs such as Oxford, Cambridge and Reading may also lose up to 15% of their current positions. The rise of [messenger bots to handle customer service](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170706-could-robots-put-an-end-to- maddening-customer-service-calls) and [self-service checkouts in supermarkets](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42052234) are examples of where automation is already having an impact, the think tank said.   Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said robots could \"compound\" the north-south divide. \"Automation and globalisation will bring huge opportunities, but there is also a real risk that many people and places will lose out,\" he said. \"We need to reform the education system to give young people the skills to thrive in the future, and we also need greater investment in lifelong learning to help adults adapt to the changing labour market.\"  Image copyrightReutersImage caption Amazon has opened a supermarket with no checkout staff at all  Russell Jones, chairman of the Mansfield 2020 business group, said the town was already adapting to automation and was not going to suffer the losses predicted in the report. \"Jobs being automated has been happening in Mansfield for the past 20 years,\" he said. \"That is why we've been building a local economy based on high quality and high-skilled jobs. Travel between junction 27 and 29 on the M1 and you'll see a vibrant mix of new housing and commercial estates. \"Our future will be somewhat different to the picture portrayed in this report.\" Prime Minister Theresa May has said the government is [committed to helping \"people secure the jobs of tomorrow\"](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches /pms-speech-at-davos-2018-25-january), with plans already in place to create a new national retraining scheme to help workers develop new skills.  ] ",

He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl. In an \"ask me anything\" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering. Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology. Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: \"The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.    \"Right now, crypto-currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and crypto- currencies is super risky for those who go long.\"  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption There are now some high-profile names cautioning against crypto-currency investment  Veteran investor Warren Buffet has previously said that the speculative crypto-currency craze \"will come to a bad end\". Mr Gates has not always been so cynical about Bitcoin. In 2014, in an interview [on Bloomberg TV,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-10-02 /bill-gates-bitcoin-is-exciting-because-its-cheap) he said that Bitcoin \"was better than currency\". His less than enthusiastic response on Reddit did not go down well with all those participating in the debate, with some reproaching him for what they felt was an attempt to influence the market. Others suggested that he needed to look again at the Bitcoin white paper.  Charitable donations In the wide-ranging Reddit chat, Mr Gates told the audience that his top three goals were \"reducing both childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio\". Mr Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which spends billions each year on education and health projects. The foundation has also sponsored the development of blockchain - the technology that underpins crypto-currenices - for merchants in Kenya. Microsoft is also looking to integrate blockchain-based technology for verifying digital identity. The rise in value of crypto-currency has prompted governments around the world to look more closely at its impact on economies and citizens. While the technology underlying it is often praised, there are concerns about how it could disrupt the economy as well as its links to cyber-crime and money laundering. The UK's Treasury Committee is [currently investigating](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43148180) the impact of such currencies.  ] ",

Tuk- tuks, the motorised rickshaws used across south-east Asia, are delivering textbooks and lessons to remote villages in a scheme known as \"Book Book Tuk- Tuk\". It can be difficult and expensive for students to get an education in rural Cambodia and a school in Takhmau, south of Phnom Penh is experimenting with taking lessons directly to them. Kuma Cambodia, a school founded in 2012 by the Norwegian Association for Private Initiative in Cambodia (NAPIC), decided to dispatch libraries on wheels to remote areas, to bring books to rural children. The Book Book Tuk Tuk project, working with village chiefs to encourage participation, sends out tuk-tuks staffed by Cambodian volunteers, many of whom are just out of school themselves.    They educate families about why it's important to send children to school, as well as addressing social issues such as HIV awareness and concerns about gambling.  'Cycle of poverty' Volunteer Pring Mean, a 21-year-old Cambodian, explained: \"Not letting children go to school is common among the poorest. \"Parents do not understand the value of education, family income is too low and so children need to work or look after young siblings, or parents suffer from drugs or alcohol addiction,\" says Mean.  Image caption Children get a chance to see books from the mobile library and to get help from volunteer staff  \"When children aren't sent to school they're more vulnerable to exploitation and getting involved in drugs or crime. Without access to education they remain in the cycle of poverty.\" The tuk-tuk volunteers teach children maths, how to draw, read, sing, and tell them traditional Cambodian stories. Although the libraries provide access to literature and advice, their primary function is to encourage parents to send their children to school. Seavsean, a 10-year-old Cambodian girl, lived under a plastic sheet with her parents and brother in a rural village in Kandal province. Her father gambled away the family's earnings, leaving her mother to sneak out at night to steal rice to feed her children.  Image caption Bringing books to rural villages helps communities which can miss out on schools  But after participating in the parent programme at Book Book Tuk Tuk, Seavsean's father stopped drinking and got a job. Now, they live in a brick house, and Seavsean attends school at Kuma Cambodia. \"We believe giving parents more knowledge, hope and motivation to help them change their destructive behaviour - like gambling, drug abuse or domestic violence - and break the cycle for their children,\" said Pring Mean. But Book Book Tuk Tuk isn't the only classroom taking to the road to reach children.  Teaching English by video  Image caption Teachers from the US deliver live English lessons on video to learners in Indonesia  In Indonesia, a lack of qualified English language teachers means many students' future employment prospects are limited. Children in low-income, rural areas have little or no access to English language teaching, while unreliable, expensive internet access rules out online learning. So three organisations, Oxford University Press (OUP), car group IndoMobil and US teaching network Eleutian, combined forces to kit out trucks with satellite technology, linking Indonesian students with US-based teachers. The trucks are driven to low-income communities across the country, park somewhere open - such as a playground - and set up. The side of the truck folds away to reveal a large TV screen, with shade from the sun and rain, and students learn from OUP's syllabus from a teacher leading the class in real time from the US. \"English proficiency is becoming increasingly important in developing countries, says OUP's Joseph Noble. \"This is particularly true in Indonesia. However, many students are being left behind.\" Since its inception, the TeachCast project has reached more than a thousand students, and has plans to expand its current fleet of 15 trucks to 500, with each truck teaching 150 students per day. * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * ['Counting every school shooting so it never seems normal'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43060002)   * ['Guns and survivalists, but no school until I was 17'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43038598)   * [Researchers examine the mysteries of falling asleep](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42945383)   * [Preventing child brides: 'I was 12 when I married a 35-year-old'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42794898)   * [US and England pull out of Pisa tests on tolerance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42781376)   * [UK university plans to access EU funds after Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42690438)   * [Putting university in reach of South Africa's townships](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42572139)   * [Sesame Street to help teach Syrian refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42429527)  The editor of Global education is sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * *  Floating schools In Bangladesh, much of the country is prone to flooding, classrooms on wheels aren't always a viable option. Flooding severely impacts children's education, adding to the country's four million children who are already out of school. \"Schools struggle against floods and riverbank erosion,\" says Mohammed Rezwan, executive director of non-profit organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha. \"The river is known as the 'destroyer of establishments'.  Image caption In Bangladesh, thousands of children learn on floating classrooms  \"Schooling opportunities are already very limited for the extremely poor, and when roads become impassable during the monsoon, students can't trek to school. \"School dropouts are common in these rural regions,\" he says. Rezwan's family owned a small boat, meaning he could attend school during monsoon season, and Rezwan was inspired to create \"floating schools\". \"I thought if children couldn't come to school, then the school should come to them.\"  Image caption The floating schools collect children from stops along the river  The organisation now owns 22 school boats, and educates nearly 2,000 children, who are collected from various riverside villages throughout the day. After the boat docks at its final destination, class begins. Each boat is equipped with solar powered electricity, a laptop, and a classroom for 30 students. Seven-year-old Suraiya Khatun, from Pabna likes this form of mobile learning. \"When I'm older I want to be a floating school teacher to teach children in our village,\" she says.  ] ",

While boys in the UK aimed to be footballers or YouTube stars, their counterparts in Uganda and Zambia wanted to be doctors or teachers. The findings are from a[ survey of 20,000 children ](https://www.educationandemployers.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/01/DrawingTheFuture.pdf)by the Education and Employers careers charity. The results are to be presented to business leaders at Davos next week. The study asked primary school children, aged seven to 11, in 20 countries to draw pictures of the jobs they wanted to have when they grew up.     Gender roles The careers charity said the results showed how much gender stereotypes were established from an early age. In the UK, girls were much less likely to want to become engineers or scientists.  Image caption Teaching was one of the most sought after jobs in many countries  But jobs such as nurse, dancer and hairdresser were among their top 10 ambitions. And boys were more likely to want to have jobs such as airline pilot and mechanic. Girls' top choices were more focused on academic success - with jobs such as teacher, vet and doctor among the most popular. By contrast, boys seemed to be much more influenced by popular culture, with jobs such as sportsman, working in social media or the police.  Social mobility In terms of social mobility, the charity said the survey showed young people needed to be introduced to different types of careers at an early age. Girls in more deprived schools were more likely to want to be shop workers and beauty therapists, while better-off boys wanted to be managers and lawyers.  Image caption Boys were more likely to want to be scientists and engineers  Outside of the UK, the drawings often showed high aspirations despite hardship. In Uganda and the Philippines, girls most want to be teachers. In Pakistan, Bangladesh, Colombia and Indonesia they want to be doctors. In China, the most popular career ambition for boys is a scientist.  Image caption In China, being a chef was named as a popular job  But across both the UK and international findings, there was a huge mismatch between the reality of the jobs market and the expectations of young people.  'Break the mould' And the charity said this misalignment remained a problem for older pupils, with a lack of advice available about what skills were really going to be in demand. \"Careers counselling in secondary schools comes far too late,\" said the OECD's education director, Andreas Schleicher. \"It is clear from the drawings that children arrive in school with strong assumptions based on their own day-to-day experiences,\" said Mr Schleicher.  Image caption Vets were a popular choice for a job, particularly for girls  \"The findings have implications for all of us seeking to improve social mobility,\" said David Cruickshank, global chairman of Deloitte and chair of trustees for Education and Employers. \"Children's career aspirations are most influenced by who they know,\" he said. Anne Lyons, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it showed how hard it was for young people to \"break the mould\" of their families' expectations. Nick Chambers, chief executive of Education and Employers, said it showed the need for children in primary school to hear about the \"vast range of career options open to them and are not ruling things out at an early age\".

But despite all the odds, in the depths of the siege of Eastern Ghouta, there are young people still trying to study and plan for a future. Such students rely on universities offering online degrees - and as well as the challenges of staying alive, they have to find access to electricity and internet connections. Mahmoud, a 20-year-old in Eastern Ghouta, has been studying computer science with the US-based [University of the People](https://www.uopeople.edu/), which offers degrees to people out of reach of conventional higher education.  'Heavy shelling' He took classes at secondary school in Eastern Ghouta through years of civil war and the siege - but then had nowhere to continue his studies into university.     Image caption The shattered home of a student in Eastern Ghouta. He survived by being elsewhere at the time it was hit.  \"When I finished high school I couldn't find a university that offered computer science degrees,\" he tells the BBC. Studying and getting a degree are important as a way of looking forward, says Mahmoud, a symbol of something better in the future. \"I think I've put my first step on the road,\" he says. The University of the People is billed as the alternative university for people with no other alternative. It was used by Syrian students during the battle for Aleppo [when the city's own university was hit by rockets](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38798308).  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Rescuing a child after an air strike during the siege  It allows students to study for an accredited degree entirely online, with support from the likes of Google and the Gates Foundation, and staffed by volunteer academics and retired university lecturers. In Eastern Ghouta, described by the UN secretary general as \"hell on earth\", the university has about 10 students still following courses.  'Survival' and 'hope' But how can anyone focus on studying during such attacks? \"Of course there are a lot of psychological effects because of what is happening around us,\" says Mahmoud. \"When the bombardment, the shelling, gets very heavy, the only thing we think about is our survival. \"And then when the bombardment gets better, even for a short amount of time, we go back to thinking about our jobs, our studies, what are we going to do in the future. \"I think personally that this dilemma is a psychological problem in itself.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Moving through the smoking ruins after an attack last week  \"Because our minds wander between two separate lives - the life of a young person trying to complete his studies and achieve his goals - and the life of a 20-year-old just trying to get through the day and to survive again to see another day.\" But having the opportunity to study, in a place cut off and encircled, is a rare source of \"optimism\", he says. \"I want to graduate, to have a degree. For us under siege that's a very big opportunity. It gives students hope.\" It's a remarkable type of determination. \"I'm motivated to learn and want to keep learning. If I have the chance, I want to be part of the process of rebuilding the country again,\" says Mahmoud.  'We've had a bloody day today' But it's far from easy. Until last month, it was \"difficult but manageable\" to keep up his studies, relying for power on local generators.  Image caption Mariam - a student who worked by candlelight during the battle for Aleppo  \"Things like electricity, internet connection, everything I need for my virtual study was hard to get because of the siege and sometimes not available at all.\" But the situation has worsened. All the families in his building have had to move down to take shelter together in the basement, he says. Another computer studies student, Majed, has had his home demolished by an air raid. He has been struggling with unreliable internet connection and problems charging his phone. While many students around the world are preparing for exams, he sent a message last week to say: \"We've had a bloody day today. Dozens of air strikes.\" On Tuesday, Majed said a ceasefire for negotiations seemed to be holding.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Families emerging from underground shelters earlier this week  But food and power remained scarce and very expensive and people had moved to makeshift bomb shelters to escape the shelling. He fears for Syria's next generation, missing out on education and with the risk of \"ignorance and child labour\". While other students are counting down the days to final exams, he has been counting the numbers of victims. But Majed says he still has \"faith\" and is looking to the future. He wants to get a PhD. \"Our lives should continue, the war should not prevent us. In the end we're the ones to rebuild the country and repair the damage. \"I believe education will help us build our future.\" * * * More from [Global education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12686570)   * [Teaching boys in Kenya how to intervene to stop sexual violence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43466365)   * [UK teacher wins global teacher prize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43422199)   * ['Don't arm our teachers' say survivors of Florida school shooting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43441226)   * [The billions in 'invisible aid' sent back home by migrant workers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43316737)   * ['Counting every school shooting so it never seems normal'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43060002)   * ['Guns and survivalists, but no school until I was 17'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43038598)  The editor of Global education is sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk * * *  ] ",

Writing to students, exams regulator Ofqual said the decision had been made \"with reluctance\" but \"we do not want anyone to have an unfair advantage\". Repeated leaks of the questions and answers [emerged in November](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42138037), throwing the qualification into disarray. Students should still complete the tasks as planned, the letter said. \"While not contributing to your grade, the task will continue to be an important part of the qualification,\" said Ofqual's director for general qualifications, Julie Swan, in the letter.    \"Learning about a high-level programming language and having the opportunity to show that you can use it to solve problems is an important aspect of a computer science course of study.\" The change affects students due to sit the exam in 2018 and 2019.  'Dismay and disappointment' More than 2,500 people, mainly students and teachers, responded to an Ofqual consultation on how to proceed, which was launched after it became clear that students who had completed the task, and possibly some teachers, had posted details to online forums and collaborative programming sites, contrary to exam board rules. In the letter, Ms Swan assured students that Ofqual had read all their responses. \"It is clear that many of you have strong views about the current situation,\" she said. \"We know that not everyone will agree with our decision. \"However, if we do not act now, it would be impossible for us to correct any unfairness caused by rules being broken.\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary heads, said the decision would be greeted \"by a huge sense of dismay and disappointment\" in schools. \"Finding out half way through the year that their hard work will no longer count towards their final grade is a particular source of disappointment for students,\" said Mr Barton. \"They will feel as if they have had the rug pulled from under their feet.\" But he acknowledged that Ofqual had to act to ensure fairness once evidence of irregularity had emerged. \"They cannot stand on the sidelines,\" he said. Ofqual said it expected teachers to set aside lesson time for students to complete the programming tasks and exam boards would be responsible for monitoring schools to ensure this happened. The changes affect all exam boards offering computer science GCSE. About 70,000 students were entered for the subject last year.  ] ",

According to [China Youth Daily](https://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309351000774196749982974054&u=1726918143&m=4196755735720529&cu=5249363350_rnd1516105386881), students at the Sichuan Vocational College of Culture and Communication were handed papers with photos of seven people during their exams, and asked to select their teacher and write their name underneath. Those who were able to identify their teacher did not get any extra marks, but students were severely penalised if they answered incorrectly, having 41 points deducted from their final score. [China Daily](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201801/16/WS5a5d9a1ca3102c394518f8f2.html) says that the identity test accounted for 30% of their overall grade. Hu Teng, a teacher at the institute, told Beijing broadcaster [BTime](https://www.miaopai.com/show/meeol08zMcC8743Iavoh6zndw8wz5JduMnGylg__.htm) that it was the first time such a question had been introduced in a class. \"The original intention of this was to assess students' general attitude towards study,\" he said. \"We wanted to see whether students have worked hard in class\\u2026 and whether they have been paying attention to details. \"If they can't even remember their teacher's name, then they clearly have no interest in the curriculum.\" The test has attracted considerable attention on Chinese social media. Some on the Sina Weibo microblog said that they thought the test was \"tasteless\" and admitted that they did not know or were unable to write the characters that made up their teacher's name. However, others applauded the college's decision. One said: \"Remembering a person's name is basic respect!\" Another added: \"If students are not in class, of course they will not know their teachers' names, so it's a good question to ask!\" Other higher education institutes have tried to find ways to combat the problem of students skipping class in recent months. In October, a Chinese university [introduced a facial recognition system](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news /blogs-news-from-elsewhere-41749929) in its classroom, in order to deter students from cutting classes. _Reporting by Kerry Allen_  **Next story:**[Singapore recruits swanbots to test water quality](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-42689027)  _Use NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via_[Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NewsfromElsewhere&src=typd).  ] ",

Washington Convention Center for The Opportunity Hiring Fair in Washington, DC, on September 20, 2017](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FC9F/production/_99817646_gettyimages-850081822.jpg)Image copyrightAFP/GettyImage caption The black unemployment rate has declined but disparities remain  The unemployment rate for US black workers jumped to 7.7% last month, reversing course after falling to a record low in December. The new figures were a potentially awkward turn of events for President Donald Trump, who has bragged repeatedly about the decline. Even before the latest data, however, critics have said the president's celebration was premature, pointing to the persistent gap between black and white unemployment rates. Job gains in 2017 pushed the black unemployment rate down in December to 6.8%. While that was the lowest rate since the US started tracking the figure in 1972, it remained by far the highest of racial groups.     Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption Members of the Congressional Black Caucus during President Trump's State of the Union speech did not clap when he mentioned the unemployment rate  The national unemployment rate has fallen 60% since 2009 to 4.1% - a level not seen since the start of the century. The white unemployment rate was 3.7% in December, while it hovered at 2.5% for Asians and at 4.9% for Hispanic and Latinos. \"The decline has occurred in the unemployment rates for everyone,\" says William Darity, a public policy professor at Duke University. \"That's the big problem I have using this as some kind of signal of an event to be celebrated.\"  Can Trump claim credit for the decline? Economists say slow and steady growth since the end of the recession is responsible for the job gains, much of which pre-date the Trump administration. In 2017, Mr Trump's first year in office, the black unemployment rate fell by about 1 percentage point. That is roughly on par with the annual pace of improvement during the final years of the Barack Obama administration.  Image copyrightAFP/GettyImage caption US President Donald Trump promotes his economic policies at the World Economic Forum  The president has touted deregulation and corporate tax cuts as lifting business confidence and spurring hiring. But US Department of Labor figures show total job gains actually slowed under President Trump. Last year, employers added about 2.1m jobs - the smallest number since 2010. \"There is certainly a genuine decline [in the unemployment rate], but I would argue that it has little to do with him,\" says Lisa Cook, an economics professor at Michigan State University. \"It has to do with a recovering economy and that didn't start start in January 2017.\" The January rate of 7.7% among black workers was the highest since April. (The unemployment rate for white workers, however, edged lower to 3.5%.) Some degree of monthly variation is expected, but last month's rise is large enough to suggest the downward trend might be over, says William Spriggs, an economics professor at Howard University and chief economist at the AFL-CIO labour union. \"I would be concerned that January isn't just the normal fluctuation,\" he says.  Is the gap between blacks and whites narrowing? The black unemployment rate has been roughly double that of the white rate for decades. While that has narrowed periodically - including in the last few years - the figures can be hard to parse. The smaller gap is not evident, for example, if the black unemployment rate is compared to that of only non-Hispanic whites.   By other measures, serious disparities persist. White families in the US typically have about seven times the wealth of black families, [according to the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent- trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of- consumer-finances-20170927.htm), an annual report from the US Federal Reserve. White households are also significantly more likely to own a home and car, and have retirement accounts or other investments. If the job gains of recent years were to continue, those differences could start to diminish, says Mr Spriggs. But the pace of job creation is slowing. And meanwhile, \"those gaps are huge\". President Trump's focus solely on the decline is perceived as a \"lack of recognition\" that the disparities remain a problem, says Hilary Shelton, a senior vice president for policy and advocacy at the NAACP civil rights organisation. He adds that the president's policies compound those concerns. \"We have not heard any discussion about what he hopes to do to specifically address the disparity that has been rather consistent,\" he says.  How much of this is due to racism? The racial gap in unemployment rates has persisted even though today's black workforce is better educated and has more skills than it had in previous decades, says Mr Spriggs. He says that is why \"it convinces me that I really am looking at discrimination\".

In an interview with CNN, the rapper Jay-Z said the president's celebration of the black unemployment rate was \"missing the whole point\". \"It's not about money at the end of the day,\" he said. \"You're missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings.\"  Are there any signs of progress?   The percentage of the working age black population that is employed has also nearly rebounded since the recession to almost 58%. Though the level remains lower than the previous record and lower than the roughly 60% for whites, the gap between the two races is smaller than it once was. The narrowing comes as the share of the US working age population that is employed has fallen dramatically for all races, with an especially sharp drop occurring during the recession. The decline, still not fully understood, has been explained by a mix of factors, including opioid addiction, automation and early retirements after job losses during the recession. The white population is aging more quickly than the black population, which may explain part of the recent convergence. The rebound among black workers also suggests they are less deterred by the low wages that have characterised many of the new jobs, Mr Spriggs says. Wage growth was relatively strong in January. But as the president's precipitate celebration of unemployment reminded, it is prudent not to read too much into one month's figures.  ] ",

It is aimed at encouraging more part-time, working students, following a fall in their numbers after the increase in tuition fees in England. There are plans for 3,000 students to take the computer science course. It comes as the prime minister's review of tuition fees aims to encourage more flexible and cheaper ways to study. The review follows concerns about the high cost of university, with average graduate debts of more than \\xa350,000.     'Step change' The University of London claims to have been the first university in the world to offer distance learning - with correspondence courses in the 1850s. But it is announcing its first online BSc course, to run from next year, with the content produced by academics at Goldsmiths, University of London.  Image caption This will be the University of London's first online BSc degree  The university's deputy chief executive, Craig O'Callaghan, says it expects to attract \"people who are working and need a more flexible approach\". Part-time student numbers fell by more than 40% after fees increased in 2012 - and the current review of university funding has to find ways to reverse this trend. There have been other online undergraduate degree courses - such as those pioneered by the Open University. But the University of London says its entry into this market is the beginning of a \"step change\" in its approach to using online courses to reach more undergraduate students.  'Older and working students' The course is being produced in a partnership with one of the world's biggest online university companies, the California-based Coursera.  Image copyrightGoldsmithsImage caption The computing course content will be from academics at Goldsmiths  This US company, which has 31 million registered students, has developed many free online courses - known as massive open online courses (Moocs) - but these are not accredited degrees. The deal with the University of London will be Coursera's first fully fledged BSc degree. It will have group work, live video and individual tuition, all delivered online. But students will go to exam centres for final, invigilated exams. Jeff Maggioncalda, the chief executive of Coursera, said the new course would be a \"game changer\" for a \"different type of student\". Adults might want to get a degree, but \"they're not going to quit their jobs to go back to class\", he says. An online degree will let them stay in work and not have the extra cost of university accommodation, says Mr Maggioncalda. \"So expect a lot of students who are older and working.\"  'Changes the equation' The course will begin with a few hundred students, but it is intended to be scaled up to having about 3,000 students - much bigger than a conventionally taught degree course. This \"totally changes the equation\" in terms of the finances of delivering university degrees, says Mr Maggioncalda. \"It's so compelling that other universities will have to follow,\" he says. Postgraduate courses have become more frequently available online - and Coursera will be announcing a number of other partnerships, including a postgraduate public health degree from Imperial College, London. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says that so far technology has not made the impact once predicted for higher education. Younger students have continued to sign up for traditional courses, regardless of the price, he says. But there is \"definitely scope for new initiatives that do things differently\" and the success of online degrees will depend on being able to \"tap deeply into the market for non-traditional students, like mature learners\".  ] ",

Mr Young quit within days over some past \"politically incorrect\" remarks. A [report by the commissioner for public appointments](https://publicappointmentscommissioner.independent.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/02/Commissioner-for-Public-Appointments-Investigation- OFS-Final-.pdf) criticised the Department for Education for failing to delve back far enough into his Twitter account. Labour said it showed the Tories were failing universities and students. The columnist was among a group of business executives appointed to the board of the Office for Students (OfS) last month to help lead the government's drive to apply market forces to higher education.    The report reveals that the then higher education minister Jo Johnson had asked officials to tell Mr Young about the vacancy, but added that after being alerted to the role Mr Young had \"applied in the same way as other candidates\".   * [Toby Young resigns from university regulator](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42617922)   * [Toby Young regrets 'politically incorrect' comments](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42552884)  The report says that Mr Young was then recommended for the job after a \"very good\" interview, although the then Education Secretary Justine Greening \"questioned the proposed choice of Mr Young, particularly in terms of time commitment\". Commissioner Peter Riddell's report said there was \"clear disparity\" in the amount of checks made between different candidates, revealed political interference in decision-making processes and \"serious shortcomings in terms of fairness and transparency\" in respect of one of the appointments. Ministers were forced to defend his appointment in the House of Commons following criticism from MPs, including prominent Tories, and a petition calling for him to be sacked gathered more than 220,000 signatures. Students and academics also took to Twitter to call for Mr Young's removal, highlighting disparaging and crude remarks he has made about women's breasts in social media posts and a 1998 article for Gear magazine on \"being a lesbian for the night\".  'No secret' The writer-turned-free school pioneer quit the OfS last month and apologised \"unreservedly\" for a string of controversial comments he had made online in recent years. According to the report, the Department for Education admitted it had not trawled back far enough into his social media accounts and was unaware of the tweets by Mr Young - even though the social media accounts of the initially preferred candidate for the separate \"student experience\" role was \"extensively examined\". \"Due diligence was inadequate and not conducted in respect of all candidates on an equal basis, compromising the principle of fairness,\" the report stated. It added: \"Mr Young's reputation as a controversialist, in itself hardly a secret, should have prompted further probing to examine whether what he had said and done might conflict with his public responsibilities and standards expected on the OfS board. \"Second, the rapid disclosure of what were described as offensive tweets in the days after his appointment suggest that it was not that hard to find them - that not much delving was required.\" * * *  Who is Toby Young? Toby Young started out as a journalist founding the culture magazine Modern Review with Julie Burchill. Following the collapse of the magazine he was recruited to work on Vanity Fair in New York, an experience that inspired his book \"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People\". As a Spectator columnist, Mr Young made a number of controversial comments including a description of wheelchair ramps as part of \"ghastly\" inclusivity in schools. In 2011 he set up the West London Free School which placed importance on discipline, ambition and \"a competitive atmosphere\". He is director of the New Schools Network, the charity which people who want to open free schools are encouraged to use. * * * The commissioner, Peter Riddell, also said that email records mention \"Number 10 Googlers\" bringing the social media history of one candidate to the attention of a minister. \"Notably, no such exploration or research was made on other possible appointees, including Mr Young,\" he added. Answering an urgent question on the appointment in the Commons, Education Minister Sam Gyimah admitted the social media vetting of Mr Young \"wasn't as extensive as it could have been, given his 40,000 tweets or so\". Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner demanded an immediate end to all-male appointment panels - after the report noted that these were used twice for the OfS. The SNP's Alan Brown labelled the recruitment process a \"blas\\xe9 crony appointment system\", while former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell branded the report \"absolutely damning, particularly in relation to the former universities' minister and his role in this appointment\". Labour's David Lammy commented: \"Toby Young believed in eugenics, he made terrible remarks about disabled people, he made awful remarks about women ... what confidence now should working class young people across this country have in the Office for Students if we have a government where the minister who did this cannot come to the despatch box, apologise or step down?\" Mr Gyimah conceded there were \"issues here that are questionable\", but he also urged MPs to have a \"sense of perspective\" about some of the \"admirable and laudable\" work carried out by Mr Young, which was \"why he was considered to be a serious candidate for this job in the first place\". But the report also described how the decision to appoint one particular candidate to the board \"was heavily influenced, not by the panel, but by special advisers, notably from 10 Downing Street\". Email records revealed a \"desire\" among ministers and special advisers not to appoint someone with close links to student unions, such as the National Union of Students, it added. That led to the preferred candidate for the student experience role being rejected.  'Lessons need to be learned' In his findings, Mr Riddell concluded that the advisory panel did judge candidates on a fair, open and impartial basis, but said \"avoidable mistakes were made\". \"My investigation uncovered a number of areas where important principles in the Governance Code were breached or compromised in the appointments to the board of the Office for Students,\" he said. \"In my experience, this episode is unrepresentative of the hundreds of public appointments that take place each year, but it is important that lessons are learned - not least so that talented people from a wide range of backgrounds are willing to put themselves forward to serve on the boards of public bodies.\" The Office for Students has been established to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors' pay and free speech on campus. It has powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards.  ] ",

The latest technology was used to recreate the Scottish bard's face from a partial cast of his skull. The words were spoken by modern-day Ayrshire poet, and Burns enthusiast, Rab Wilson. Motion capture was then used to track his facial movements as poem To a Mouse was recited. It was Mr Wilson's idea to use the skull cast to recreate the bard reciting one of his best known works.      * [The night Robert Burns' skull was taken for a walk](/news/uk-scotland-42792794)   * [Campaigner wins Burns Award ](/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-42803889)  He said: \"It had always occurred to me, that the burns skull existed. \"I thought well we can take the skull and rebuild Burns' face.\" The project involved a team from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Dundee. Once the facial movements were transferred to the 3D digital model of Burns, Mr Wilson's voice was added to the final animation.  Image copyrightFaceLab  Prof Caroline Wilkinson, from Face Lab at John Moores University, said: \"This real-life animation of Robert Burns has brought the poetry of this Scots Bard back to life for generations to come.\" \"We didn't want it to look like an animation, we wanted it to look like a living person.\" The team would now like to apply the technology to other historical figures. Mr Wilson said: \"This is an amazing leap forward, it has so many possibilities now, especially for education, being able to have Burns come alive and read his poems for kids in schools. \"Who knows what other applications there might be.\"  Image caption From one Ayrshire poet to another: Rab Wilson next to the digital recreation of Burns  Burns was born on 25 January 1759 in the village of Alloway, Ayrshire, and his birthday has been celebrated with suppers in his honour for about 200 years. The poet, who wrote Auld Lang Syne, To a Mouse and Ae Fond Kiss, died in 1796, at the age of 37. Some 40 years after his death his grave was reopened and a cast was taken of his skull. The latest animation will be screened to the public at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh on Burns Day.  ] ",

The party said Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) needed to be \"reset\". It said the scheme's principles were sound but that improvements were needed. The Scottish government said CfE provided young people with \"a well-rounded education\" and was \"broadly endorsed in Scotland\". Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, said the biggest problems with CfE were staff and resources.    In a newly-published paper, the Conservatives made five key recommendations to improve the delivery of Curriculum for Excellence. These were:   * Improve clarity, accountability and measurement - so parents, teachers and young people know exactly what CfE is expected to deliver   * Address the teacher shortage crisis by opening up new routes into the classroom and reform teacher training to boost standards   * Slash the excessive guidance and paperwork issued to teachers to ensure that CfE has the appropriate balance between learning core knowledge and new skills   * Reform Scotland's Education Agencies - Education Scotland should not be responsible for curriculum development, and for inspecting it   * Extend school autonomy so head-teachers are free to make decisions to help drive up standards in their own school community  Supporters of the Scottish government would argue it has already taken steps in some of these directions. For instance, [revised curriculum guidance has been issued](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-37210159) and the government aims to try to give [as much power as possible to head teachers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40275330) through governance reforms. The Conservatives said their paper followed extensive consultation with teachers, education experts and parents across Scotland.  'Back on track' In her conclusion, the Scottish Conservatives education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: \"Throughout all the interviews and consultations we undertook, there was general agreement that the principles which underpin Curriculum for Excellence - and which were agreed unanimously by Scotland's political parties - are sound. \"This is because there is widespread agreement that pupils should understand why they are learning something just as much as what they are learning.\" She added: \"There was also general agreement however, that the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence has been fraught with problems which, in turn, have undermined its effective delivery in the classroom. \"There is no time to lose to get Curriculum for Excellence back on track and ensure that Scotland is, once again, leading the field in education.\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Speaking as the paper was launched Ms Smith said: \"Simply put, Curriculum for Excellence needs to be reset. Under the SNP, its implementation has been muddled at best and chaotic at worst. \"There is no point having a new curriculum if pupils are not getting the basics in literacy and numeracy and teachers are left confused by what they're supposed to be doing. As the evidence shows, this will only lead to disruption in the classroom as pupils switch off. \"The SNP must get a grip. Nicola Sturgeon said education was her top priority after she became first minister - only to spend most of her time obsessing over independence. In 2018, it is time she honoured her promise.\" Responding to the Tories' paper, a spokesman for the Scottish government said CfE prepares young people to \"thrive in today's world\".  'Inadequate support' He added: \"Teacher numbers are rising in Scotland and are now 543 higher than last year as a consequence of the measures put in place by this government, including 11 new routes into teaching. \"We acted in 2016 to clarify and simplify the curriculum framework and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, ensuring teachers can focus on providing valuable learning experiences for young people. \"Our education reforms will create a school and teacher-led system, empowering teachers to fully deliver the vision of Curriculum for Excellence.\" He added: \"Decisions that shape the education of our young people will be made in classrooms, schools and establishments by people working directly with those young people, their parents and communities. That is the correct approach to strengthen Scottish education.\" EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"The EIS would agree that the founding principles of Curriculum for Excellence remain sound and would acknowledge that there has been a deficit of support from Education Scotland. \"The main challenges faced by CfE, however, have been caused by inadequate support, in terms of both staffing and resources. \"The most important steps that could be taken to ensure the success of CfE are the ending of austerity and increased investment in our schools, teachers and pupils.\" He added: \"In terms of recruiting more teachers, fast tracking a substantial pay increase would be the best recruitment tool available to Scotland's politicians.\"  ] ",

Naveed Hussain, 39, the owner of Bordesley Independent School, was handed a prohibition order preventing him from working as a teacher. The school was criticised by inspectors over child safety and the quality of its education. An inspection found the school had no running water in the toilet area.  * [Midlands Live: Former WBA player Cyrille Regis dies; Thousands of Carillion jobs at risk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-42666978) A professional conduct panel heard on one visit to the Birmingham school, inspectors found leaflets titled \"Islam and terrorism?\", written by an individual that \"had been found to have been denied access to the UK due to his extremist views\".    \"Rooms were unkempt and/or unhygienic and/or cold and/or inadequate for the delivery of the curriculum suitable for the age of the young people attending the school (11-16 years)\", the report said. Inspections also found the RE curriculum only dealt with Islam \"to the exclusion of any other religions\".  'Some remorse' Mr Hussain qualified as a teacher in 2006 and set up the business that ran Bordesley Independent School in September 2014. The panel concluded Mr Hussain's conduct \"fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession\". The report said: \"Whilst the conduct found against Mr Hussain took place not when he was teaching but instead running a school, he was also a teacher of some experience and the panel considered that a strong public interest consideration in declaring proper standards of conduct in the profession was also present. \"The conduct found against Mr Hussain was outside that which could reasonably be tolerated.\" \"In evidence, Mr Hussain did show some remorse and insight into his failings as well as appreciating that some of the concerns raised by Ofsted were not dealt with appropriately and that he would act differently in the future.\" Mr Hussain can apply for the ban to be lifted in two years' time.  ] ",

Jules White, who led a protest by 5,000 schools over funding, says these \"massive issues\" must be tackled. It comes alongside speculation over the future of Education Secretary Justine Greening. A reshuffle of Cabinet ministers is expected later on Monday. Mr White, a [West Sussex head teacher who has co-ordinated letters sent to 2.5 million parents over school funding concerns](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41417313), says that whoever is education secretary needs to make a priority of teacher supply and funding.     'Moribund' But he warns that too often political battles can mean schools policy is sidetracked by \"dubious ideological pursuits\" or \"tinkering around the edges\". Mr White argues there have been too many small-scale initiatives that \"do everything except address the issues that every school and family knows are crucial\". \"Overall teacher supply, adequate funding and social mobility are left in a moribund state,\" says Mr White, of the Worth Less? campaign. There have been reports that Ms Greening's position as Education Secretary is under threat, as Prime Minister Theresa May begins a reshuffle of ministers. Although, Number 10 has described the reports as \"guesswork\". School funding became a doorstep issue in the general election, with campaigners warning that schools were having to ask parents for financial contributions. In the wake of the election, Ms Greening announced that \\xa31.3bn of the education department's budget would be moved to schools. She pressed ahead with a new funding formula, intended to tackle regional anomalies in funding for individual schools. Ms Greening had been in charge of the education brief during the Conservatives' attempt to bring back grammar schools - a policy abandoned in the wake of the election. The education secretary also faces big decisions over higher education, including the future of tuition fees and university funding.  ] ",

Nick Timothy said Ms Greening - who quit in the reshuffle after the PM tried to move her to another department - had resisted attempts to reform school and tuition fees policy. This claim was branded \"so wrong\" by ex-universities minister Jo Johnson. Mr Johnson said Ms Greening had been \"faultlessly loyal\".   * [Who really gained from the reshuffle?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42625479)   * [A who's who guide to the new cabinet](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42615109)  Mr Timothy, who quit Downing Street after playing a key role in the Conservatives' unsuccessful general election campaign, has since become a newspaper columnist.    In the [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/10/nick- timothy-justine-greening-blocked-tuition-fee-cuts/), he wrote that when she was education secretary, Ms Greening had \"exasperated\" Mrs May, was \"unpopular with officials\" and \"frustrated reformers\". \"Charged with making Britain 'the world's great meritocracy', she put the brakes on policies that work, like free schools, and devised bureaucratic initiatives of little value,\" he wrote. He denied allegations that he had \"orchestrated\" Ms Greening's departure from her post, but backed the decision to replace her with Damian Hinds. He also accused her of blocking proposals to cut university tuition fees. But his claims were dismissed by Mr Johnson, who was universities minister until the reshuffle, when he was moved to the Department for Transport.

The authority said it was because those schools were unable to show they could stay within their allocated budgets in 2017/18. By contrast, only 239 schools have had their spending plans approved. If the EA does not approve a school's budget plan, it can take more control over the school's financial planning.   * [NI schools in the red: \\xa3350m funds gap](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-42317279)   * [Principals write to NI Secretary over budget cuts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41901244)   * [Minister warns schools need extra money](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38746772)  [There have been numerous warnings from school principals about the financial pressure their schools are facing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern- ireland-41901244).    [Those warnings were echoed in December 2017 by the head of the EA, Gavin Boyd](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-42317279).  Image caption School principals have been briefed on the education system's future finances  School principals have had to submit three-year spending plans, covering the years 2017-2020 to the EA.  'Significant financial pressure' For the 632 schools whose plans have been rejected, this means they do not yet have approval to spend the money they say they need to spend to run the school. In letters to each of the schools affected, the EA said it would \"work with you throughout this financial year to address the issues reflected in your school's plan.\" EA Chief Executive Gavin Boyd said the body's budgets were tight: \"The problem is that so many of our schools are under such financial pressure, that if they all overspent by 5% in year then the budget for the system as a whole would be 5% over and we simply don't have the resources,\" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. Mr Boyd said there were two possible solutions to the financial problem: a large injection of money or a \"fundamental transformation\" of the the education system. However, he said that transformation could not be achieved in the short term. Earlier, an EA spokesperson told the BBC that the education sector was facing \"significant financial pressure\". \"Six-hundred-and-thirty-two schools have not yet had their plans approved as they were unable to demonstrate they could live within their budget allocations for 2017/18,\" they said. \"EA continues to work with these schools to help them develop plans which demonstrate they can live within their budgets. \"We continue to highlight the increasing financial challenges facing the education sector and the growing demand for services as we move into 2018/19 and beyond.\"  ] ",

Ex-minister Anna Soubry said the PM must not let what she said were 35 MPs dictate the terms of the UK's EU exit. No 10 says Mrs May had made progress in the negotiations and set out a \"clear vision\" of the UK's future relations. But Labour said days of infighting showed the Tories were \"incapable\" of setting out a clear position on Brexit. During an urgent question in the Commons on the second phase of Brexit talks, Sir Bill Cash urged the UK to reject the EU's guidelines for a transition period after its departure on March 29, 2019, while Philip Hollobone said the Treasury must \"get with the programme\" and accept the UK was separating itself from the EU.    Downing Street has rejected calls for Chancellor Philip Hammond - who has come under fire in recent days after suggesting Brexit should result in \"very modest\" changes in EU-UK trade - to be sacked.   * [Greening calls for return of student grants](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42859703)   * [Trump 'would've done Brexit differently'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-42850362/trump-i-would-have-taken-a-tougher-stand-in-getting-out)   * [Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface](/news/uk-politics-42827278)  There have been rumblings among some Conservative MPs about the performance of both the chancellor and the prime minister. At a Westminster event on Monday one Conservative MP, Johnny Mercer said the \"window is closing\" for the PM to meet the challenges of leadership.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05wc0z8.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionDavid Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative \"family\" should think about more than Brexit And Ms Soubry - who favours the UK remaining in the customs union and single market - said Mrs May must exert her authority over the Brexit process by putting the \"interests of the economy over and above ideology\". \"When is the government going to stand up against the hard Brexiteers who mainly inhabit these benches - there's only about 35 of them - see them off, and make sure that we get a sensible Brexit, because if we don't, we will sleepwalk into a disastrous Brexit for generations to come.\"   * [Davis plays down Tory Brexit row](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42827270)   * [Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit](/news/uk-politics-42823654)  [As the EU published its guidelines for negotiations ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42861496)on a transition or implementation period after the UK leaves, there have been warnings from Tory Eurosceptics that the UK will stay in the EU \"in all but name\". Sir Bill Cash said the PM must reject any outcome which saw the UK having to accept EU law during the transition period and submit to the authority of the European Court of Justice to enforce compliance. \"Given we are leaving the EU, and therefore the customs union, single market and provisions relating to free movement, is the government going to reject this new EU ultimatum,\" he said. \"Does the government reject this European Council decision as inconsistent with us leaving the European Union?\"  Greening on Brexit and losing her job Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former education secretary Justine Greening said she remained a \"firm supporter\" of Mrs May and called on \"soundings off\" to stop. \"I think people need to get behind her. I think she is doing an important job for our country. We need to support her in that impossible, almost, task that she has negotiating Brexit.\" During the reshuffle earlier this month, Mrs May had wanted to move Mrs Greening to the Department for Work and Pensions, but she refused and quit the government instead.

Asked about this, Ms Greening said she had opposed a review into cutting the maximum level of fees that can be charged, suggesting this would have kicked the issue \"into the long grass\". She warned that variable tuition fees could lead to science, technology, engineering and maths degrees becoming more expensive with poorer students feeling they ought to focus on \"cheaper\" subjects. And she said it was \"wrong\" that poorer students were the main losers from the scrapping of maintenance grants. The \\xa33,387 grants towards living costs were available to students from families with annual incomes of \\xa325,000. \"I think we have to have a student finance system that's progressive, not regressive.\"  ] ",

Alice Smith has endometriosis and is leading a campaign to get \"menstrual wellbeing\" on to the school curriculum. \"We need to start breaking down the taboos about what is normal and what is not normal,\" says Alice. A [government consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations /changes-to-teaching-of-sex-and-relationship-education-and-pshe) reviewing the sex and relationship education curriculum in English schools ends in February.  Image copyrightAlice Smith Alice was embarrassed to talk about her periods because she didn't know if what she was going through was normal.    Endometriosis, which affects one in ten women, can [cause chronic pain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39364958/endometriosis-treatment- unacceptable-and-women-arent-diagnosed-quickly-enough), heavy periods, painful sex and depression. \"Every time I had a period I had to go to A&E and I was given morphine,\" she tells Newsbeat. She was eventually diagnosed at 14 after an operation. But, even then, she found it \"isolating\". \"My best friends knew about it but they couldn't relate because it wasn't spoken about,\" she says.  'No-one understood' Eloise, an 18-year-old from Portsmouth, was only diagnosed with endometriosis last year - despite starting her period when she was 11. She agrees that talking about periods more openly would have helped her. \"It really needs to be talked about from a younger age and there needs to be a lot more awareness about the condition.  Image copyrightEloise CageImage caption Eloise started her period at 11  \"My periods were horrible - they were so heavy I would change my pads every half an hour. \"I ended up missing a lot of school because I was in so much pain and no-one really understood. People kept saying I'd grow out of it.\" She says boys and girls should be taught about periods together. \"It's extremely important menstrual wellbeing is being taught to boys and girls - this shouldn't be a segregated issue. \"Look at my brother, his sister has endometriosis, it's important he knows as much as possible. This isn't just a women's issue.\"  Image copyrightGetty Images Ellie has started a petition on the issue and, if it gets enough signatures, she wants to take it to Parliament. A Department for Education spokesperson says: \"Current guidance to schools on relationship and sex education encourages schools to make adequate and sensitive arrangements to help girls cope with menstruation.\" The government's consultation to update guidance on what should be taught when sex education becomes compulsory in all schools will take effect in 2019.  _Listen to Newsbeat_[live](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/bbc_radio_one) _at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back_[here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkry/episodes/player)  ] ",

A new legal obligation for schools to register will be created \"as soon as possible\" under the proposals. The move follows concerns some ultra orthodox Jewish and Muslim children are being denied a basic education. Ofsted currently struggles to gather evidence to prosecute people running illegal schools. Both the current Chief Inspector of Schools, Amanda Spielman, and her predecessor Michael Wilshaw, have told the BBC they needed stronger powers.    A recent BBC investigation highlighted frustration about the lack of legal powers and loopholes in the law. [Should a school be in a place like this?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43170447) [Abuse concerns over unregistered schools](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43126598) Ofsted told the BBC, its inspector had to watch while children were ushered out the back door by adults who disappeared. By the end of January this year a specialist team of inspectors had uncovered 176 places it said were operating as schools but were not registered. While many have been identified as Jewish or Muslim, 43% are providing an alternative to mainstream school for excluded children.  Hours of education The government is proposing to legislate to require anywhere where children spend more than 18 hours to register as a school. This stops short of the measures proposed by ministers in 2015 which did not specify school hours.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption The rules on illegal schools are woefully inadequate, inspectors say  Mosques and some Christian groups expressed concern this would force routine religious instruction in madrasas or Sunday schools to be regulated. England's Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the government wanted to ensure all children learned \"the values that underpin our society, including fairness, tolerance and respect\". \"These are values that help knit our communities together, which is why education is at the heart of this strategy. \"It's also important that children are taught in a safe environment and that we can act quickly if children are at risk or being encouraged to undermine these values. Together, with Ofsted and communities across the country, we will build on the work already underway to achieve this.\" However, a lack of parliamentary time means this might not happen before the next election. And without greater legal clarity it might still prove difficult to bring prosecutions even with stronger powers for Ofsted. Some unregistered settings have been operating in a grey area of the law with parents insisting they are part of home education. The government says it will clarify the regulations on home education, but is not planning to change them. * * * **If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us at**[ haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk](mailto:@bbc.co.uk?subject=Schools43126598)  _Your details and any information you send will be treated in confidence._ You can also contact us in the following ways:   * WhatsApp: **+44 7555 173285**   * Text an SMS or MMS to **61124** (UK)   * Please read our [terms & conditions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/what-can-the-bbc-do-with-the-content-that-i-post/)   ,  Or use the form below:  Your contact details Name (optional) Your E-mail address (required) Town & Country (optional) Your telephone number (optional) Comments (required) If you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on.

Its chief executive Alastair MacKinnon said some adults think they are \"doing young people a favour\" when buying them tobacco. The charity has launched a new campaign against proxy purchasing. On average, 36 young people in Scotland take up smoking every day, according to Ash Scotland. Mr MacKinnon has pledged to support Scotland's Charter for a Tobacco-free Generation - six principles laid down by Ash towards a smoke free nation.    The Scottish government aims to have a \"smoke-free generation\" in Scotland by 2034. The number of young people smoking in Scotland has fallen to its lowest level since surveys began, after measures such as banning tobacco advertising, price increases and raising the age of purchasing cigarettes to 18.  Brand awareness A government report stated there had been a reduction in cigarette brand awareness in young people, which was attributed to products being moved from view. Mr MacKinnon said: \"Some adults think that they're doing young people a favour when they buy them tobacco - particularly if it happened for them when they were at school. But it's not a victimless crime. \"We know from talking to teachers that in schools where smoking rates are high in the local community, cigarettes are sold to younger children by teen smokers in order to maintain their own smoking. \"Adults willing to buy tobacco for young people are really just carrying out the work of Big Tobacco. They're leading young people into addiction, long- term health problems and huge financial cost. It has to stop.\" Ash Scotland chief executive Sheila Duffy added: \"The tobacco industry uses every trick in the book to snare new young people into becoming smokers, with the result that 36 children start smoking every day in Scotland. We mustn't do their job for them.\"  ] ",

So is it ready to host the Paralympics? South Korea is famed for its technology and fast-pace, its difficult relationship with North Korea and of course K-Pop which burst on to the Western music scene with Gangnam Style. But it hasn't always been as forward- thinking when it comes to women, especially if they're disabled. \"Women could never be heroes,\" travel writer, Seoul-dweller and disability campaigner Seyoon Jane Hong, 30, says. \"Until the 20th Century, everything was male-centred. \"Even now if you are young, you may experience unfairness. When you're a woman, oppression is added. And if there is a disability, it is triple discrimination.\"     Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption K-pop star Psy performing his global hit Gangnam Style  It's something she and her friends face, but the country is in flux - divided by age, gender and ability - perhaps not too dissimilar to the UK. \"Baby Boomers and the older generation give more value to economic development than human rights, peace and equality,\" she says. \"To them, disabled people are patients who need help. \"Younger generations, on the other hand, are much more flexible. They acknowledge that various people live together in society and regard people as important rather than economic.\" Hong has been in a wheelchair for 20 years after she contracted a spinal cord virus - aged 10. She spent years confined to Seoul, South Korea's capital, until she decided to travel alone when the first accessible express train, KTX was completed. She felt liberation and wanderlust - emotions that had never been experienced by disabled people older than her. Hong recalls elderly women telling her how their lives were stunted by the perception of their disability. They were dehumanised - forced to marry older men, or unsuitable disabled men, because remaining single was unacceptable. \"They have not been recognised for their femininity because they may have difficulty in bearing and nurturing children,\" she says. \"They experienced repression and frustration from the people around them. There was no opportunity.\" She says expectations have changed and, in 2018, there is less emphasis on marriage and beauty, and those with disabilities are \"free to love and get married or spontaneously stay single\". As a United Nations member, South Korea follows the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on- the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html). The convention includes the equal rights of women and children who are disabled. Since the 1990s, disabled children have attended mainstream school. Hong is young enough to have benefitted from this inclusive step forward, although she says her own experience was challenging. \"If the teacher had a strong understanding of the disability, it was easy to participate in the class. But if not, it was difficult.\" Preconceptions have started to change, with talks and outreach programmes in place. There are many disabled students at university although youth unemployment is high and, for those with disabilities, it's even worse.  Image copyrightGetty Images The OECD, the club of industrialised nations, says 5% of South Korea's 50 million population are registered disabled and, of those, 64.5% are unemployed according to [Human Rights Korea](http://www.humanrightskorea.org/2015 /unfulfilled-promise-employment-promotion-disabled-persons-act/). The government has tried to combat these high figures by taxing companies \\xa3637 annually if they don't employ 1.5 disabled people for every 50 people they hire. But according to the [Ministry of Employment and Labor](http://www.moel.go.kr/english/poli/poliLaw_view.jsp?idx=1372), more than half of all companies opt to pay the fine instead. Britain doesn't have a quota system but other European countries like Germany and Austria do - and are said to have a similar pushback from employers. Those in South Korea who are unable to find work can apply for benefits through a controversial grading system based entirely on medical assessments rather than factors such as whether someone lives rurally or in the city. Hong says the money is never enough and leaves many people \"having to rely on their families\". There are some spotlight areas of progress, most noticeably in the creative sector with disabled contributors featuring more in newspapers and on TV. KBS, the state-run broadcaster, made headlines around the world in 2011 when it [employed Lee Chang-hoon as a TV news anchor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av /world-asia-18460807/blind-news-presenter-charms-s-korea).  Image caption Blind presenter Lee Chang-hoon in front of TV camera  Chang-hoon lost his sight as a baby but, at the age of 27, he impressed the producers with his ability to read and write scripts quickly in Braille and became the first of a number of disabled presenters. In the online world, animator Laila - who is deaf - has made her mark with popular web comic I Am Deaf, which is about living in South Korea without hearing. An enthusiastic 9.4 million people read \"webtoons\" each day and Hong describes Laila's story as \"popular with everyone\". In one of its 200 episodes, the main character is mystified when a [sweet potato is thrown at them](https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-173051/chapter /mrs-chapter-100020126). It turns out to be hurled by a visitor when the character doesn't hear the doorbell. Despite the bizarre storyline, people seem to relate to these skits, with one person commenting: \"I can only hear from one side of the ear, but I could already identify a lot with you, I'm learning how to understand others through you.\" Hong herself is the author of Europe, There's No Reason Not to Go, a guide which documents her wheelchair travels. She is passionate that all disabled people have the chance to explore internationally and says it's a route into social participation.  Image copyrightSeyoon Jane HongImage caption Seyoon Jane Hong - who has been in a wheelchair since the age of 10 - on a mountain trail  But overseas travel has highlighted the accessibility challenges she still has in her own country. About 70% of buses in Seoul do not have low floors - making them inaccessible for wheelchairs. Bus companies don't want to invest in a minority, and, with its many cars and illegal street parking, Seoul is unfriendly for blind people, Hong says. This jars a little with the country's adoption of the UN Convention which \"requires\" each signatory to \"identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers and ensure that disabled people can access their environment and transportation\". The world has been focused on Pyeongchang as a Winter Olympic and Paralympic host. We think of the host venues as cities, but this is a region - with a ski resort - and it has given the country chance to showcase how far it has come. A high-speed train, suitable for wheelchairs, will shuttle spectators to the Games - and the Paralympic committee has ensured there are parking areas, ramps and accessible accommodation.  Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption One of the venues for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Paralympic Games  Hong sees Pyeongchang 2018 as an opportunity for people to communicate about the global future of disability and says South Korea is ready for the Winter Paralympics. \"You do not have to speak a foreign language in this age. You can talk as you and I do with a translator. What is important is meeting people in the world who share the same values. \"I want to meet more disabled people in the world. That way, you can apply better values back to Korea, and we can distribute the great value of Korea to others.\" Despite requests for a statement on the wording in the volunteer handbook, the organisers of Pyeongchang 2018, did not respond to the BBC. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said it had requested the clumsy wording be updated and said the phrase may have been lost in translation. As per the IPC's request, the webpage containing a link to the booklet was \"temporarily [taken] down for system update\" - but this has remained the case for over a month and now the games are under way.

Ms Greening, removed in the cabinet reshuffle, also raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts. She said that any student finance system needed to be \"progressive\". Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a major review of tuition fees and university funding. But, Ms Greening, speaking on [BBC Radio 4's Today programme,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qj9z) said she was against the idea of different levels of fees for different courses, because it could push poorer students into cheaper, less prestigious degrees.    Her successor as education secretary, Damian Hinds, is expected to launch a review of student finance in England.  Interest charges There been claims that Ms Greening had been reluctant to have a review - but she said that she had been wary of anything that became an excuse to kick changes \"into the long grass\".  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05wg8k9.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionJustine Greening says a review of student fees could kick issues into the \"long grass\" Ms Greening said students were worried about the level of interest charges - currently 6.1% - and that the loss of maintenance grants put an unfair burden on the poorest students. These grants were abolished from 2016-17 and replaced by loans, which have to be repaid with interest. Ms Greening said that it was \"wrong\" that as a result of this, \"young people from more disadvantaged, poorer backgrounds are coming out with more debt than their better-off peers\".   * [Tuition fee decision waiting for Damian Hinds, new education secretary](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42623929)   * [What is going to happen next with tuition fees?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41308396)   * [10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40511184)   * [Are tuition fees really heading for the scrap heap?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40569202)  In terms of the tuition fees system, she argued in favour of a \"time-limited graduate contribution\" with the money being ring-fenced for higher education. The forthcoming review of tuition fees will have to consider issues such as whether fees should be reduced or lowered, the interest charges on loans, cross-subsidies between subjects and the availability of support for poorer students. The Department for Education says that replacing maintenance grants with loans has given poorer students more \"cash-in-hand support\". A DFE spokeswoman says that the current system provides \"sustainable funding\" for universities, maintains access for students and supports repayment arrangements which are \"fair to both graduates and taxpayers\". Labour has campaigned for the scrapping of tuition fees and the restoration of maintenance grants. The shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \"Justine Greening is absolutely right that her own party's decision to abolish maintenance grants was wrong and that it is the most disadvantaged families and students who have suffered.\" She said that without any timetable for the review, students would still face \"huge fees\" to go to university.  ] ",

The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) said the number of entrants on taught postgraduate courses had increased by 21% over the past decade. Provisional figures for the current year suggest this trend is continuing. The figures are contained in a wide-ranging set of statistics which have been published by the SFC. The report said there were 292,620 students in higher education in Scotland in 2016/17, an increase of 7,170 (2.5%) from 2015/16.    In 2016/17, HE entrants at colleges accounted for 27.5% of all higher education entrants in Scotland. Between 2015/16 and 2016/17, the number of students aged under 25 increased by 3,615 (1.9%) and students aged 25 to 29 increased by 980 (2.8%). Those aged 30 and over increased by 2,590 (4.0%).  'Expanding access' The minister for further education, higher education and science, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said: \"It is welcome to see in these latest statistics that we have a record number of post-graduate students and increases in both part-time and older learners. \"This government is determined to make higher education as accessible as possible to everyone in Scotland. We recognise the importance of postgraduate study and providing the opportunities for people to get a higher education qualification later in life. That is why we are enabling even more people to study for a postgraduate qualification in the coming years by expanding access to tuition fee loans and living cost loans to students studying by distance learning. \"What these figures show is that the higher education sector in this country is continuing to go from strength to strength, with colleges playing a vital role in the delivery of many higher education courses across Scotland.\" John Kemp, interim chief executive of the Scottish Funding Council, said: \"Scotland has a world-leading university system. \"Today's figures show Scotland continuing ability to attract postgraduate researchers and how taught postgraduate programmes are increasingly bringing advanced skills and knowledge into Scottish industry.\"  Disadvantaged areas The SFC said the report on students eligible for funding in 2017/18 excludes students who withdrew shortly after the start of their course and provides an early insight into the patterns of provision for the current academic year. It shows an overall increase of 1,780 in the full time equivalent number of students in Scottish universities between 2016/17 and 2017/18. The report also highlighted the role colleges play helping people from disadvantaged areas. Shona Struthers, Colleges Scotland's chief executive, said: \"We welcome this report and are pleased with the confirmation that colleges continue to offer the most accessible path to learning for Scottish-domiciled students with an increase to 23.2% of all higher education students from the 20% most deprived areas in Scotland studying at colleges. \"A substantial proportion of students continue to start higher education courses in colleges, with entrants to colleges comprising 27.5% of all higher education students. \"Colleges have a crucial role in identifying, helping, and facilitating alternative pathways for people, and providing students with work-ready skills, upskilling, and retraining as well as qualifications.\"  ] ",

Sara Khan, who has campaigned for women's rights in Muslim communities, has been given the task of rooting out extremism in the UK. She has promised \"zero tolerance to those who promote hate\". But her support for the Home Office's Prevent strategy has led to claims she is too close to the government. Downing Street has insisted Ms Khan is \"expertly qualified\" for the new role - but a number of Muslim organisations are understood to be calling for her to be sacked and saying they will not work with her.    A petition by anti-Islamophobia campaign MEND, saying her appointment \"will further damage relations between the government and Muslim communities,\" is being circulated, the BBC understands. Lady Warsi, the first Muslim woman to serve as a British cabinet minister, said many British Muslims saw Ms Khan as a \"mouthpiece\" of ministers. The Conservative peer questioned Ms Khan's likely independence as the Commissioner for Countering Extremism in a series of tweets and warned of \"destructive and dangerous games\" being played.

Who is Sara Khan? [She describes herself on her website](http://sarakhan.co.uk/) as a \"born human rights activist\", and has campaigned for women's rights within British Muslim communities for over 20 years. Born and raised in Bradford, she worked as a hospital pharmacist and was president of an Islamic youth organisation before launching the Inspire charity in 2008, with the aim of challenging extremism and promoting gender equality. In September 2005, after the London bombings, she sat on the Home Office's Tackling Extremism and Radicalisation Working Group and has also worked with the education department and the Department for International Development. In 2015, she was named in the [BBC Woman's Hour Power List](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1wsc6xjTph1CvN5jWzLtfzT/womans- hour-2015-power-list-influencers).   Ms Khan has been a vocal supporter of the government's Prevent strategy, which operates through community groups, local authorities and the police to identify and \"divert\" those deemed to be at risk of radicalisation. But the scheme has proved controversial, with claims it demonises and spies on Muslim communities. A UN Human Rights Council report in 2016 said Prevent was \"inherently flawed.\"   * [UN labels Prevent 'inherently flawed'](/news/uk-politics-40286861)   * [Longer jail terms for web terror viewers](/news/uk-41479620)  Ms Khan hit back at her critics, telling the BBC: \"My work over the last 10 years speaks for itself. \"I don't recognise this idea of being a mouthpiece. \"I want to recognise and empower the victims of extremism.  Far-right extremism \"This idea that I am a creation of the Home Office is just frankly ridiculous.\" She earlier told Sky News: \"The work that I am doing in the commission is not part of Prevent. This is about preventing extremism. Prevent is part of the countering terrorism strategy.\" One of her first tasks, she said, would be to carry out \"a comprehensive study of the scale, influence and reach of extremism in this country - because I don't believe we have a clear national or regional picture\". She said she wanted to challenge hate speech by offering an \"alternative narrative, not to drive it underground\" - and she stressed that she would not just be focusing on Islamic extremism. \"Far-right extremism is a virulent strain that is permeating all aspects of our society - the two feed each other, they have a symbiotic relationship with each other... and it's important that I am going to be challenging both.\"  Warning signs Plans to set up the commission were announced in the wake of the Manchester bombing last May - one of five terror attacks to hit Britain in 2017 - which took place during the general election campaign. Its remit is also expected to include helping train schools and colleges to spot warning signs and ensuring women's rights are upheld.    Analysis  **By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent** Given that it's so hard to come up with a definition of extremism on which everyone is agreed, whoever got this job was going to face criticism. But on top of that, Sara Khan is something of the Marmite candidate: people either love her for the manner in which she has spoken out - or they absolutely loathe her for allegedly \"selling out\" Muslim identity and being prepared to debate with some provocative commentators who have been labelled Islamophobes. So the challenge she faces is twofold: First to come up with a plan to combat extremism - and secondly to get everyone to agree to it.   Labour MP Naz Shah, who chairs the British Muslims All Party Parliamentary group, is a longstanding critic of Ms Khan's work and support for Prevent. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What is at question is the independence of the person appointed. \"It's a fantastic appointment for the Home Office because this is somebody who is a creation of the Home Office.\" Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said Ms Khan's appointment was \"very ill-advised\" and would not \"build confidence across our communities\". Lib Dem equalities spokeswoman Baroness Hussein-Ece said Ms Khan \"will need to prove herself as a critical friend to government in order to inspire confidence\". But the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson, tweeted: \"The idea that she is a government stooge is hard to reconcile with her opposition (strongly shared by me) to its ill-advised 2015-16 plans for a counter-extremism bill.\" He added: \"Let's hope she and her fellow-commissioners can make something useful of this post, whose intended purpose I have never really understood.\"  ] ",

Big technology firms face paying more tax under plans announced by the European Commission. It said companies with significant online revenues should pay a 3% tax on turnover for various online services, bringing in an estimated \\u20ac5bn (\\xa34.4bn). The proposal would affect firms such as Facebook and Google with global annual revenues above \\u20ac750m and taxable EU revenue above \\u20ac50m. The move follows criticism that tech giants pay too little tax in Europe. EU economics affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the \"current legal vacuum is creating a serious shortfall in the public revenue of our member states\".    He stressed it was not a move against the US or \"GAFA\" - the acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. According to the Commission, top digital firms pay an average tax rate of just 9.5% in the EU - far less than the 23.3% paid by traditional companies.   Its figures are disputed by the big tech firms, which have called the tax proposal \"populist and flawed\". Countries including the UK and France have accused firms of routing some profits through low-tax EU member states such as Ireland and Luxembourg. Big US tech companies have argued they are complying with national and international tax laws. However, the Commission said it wanted to tax companies according to where their digital users are based. * * *  **Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor** It doesn't appear that Britain's journey towards the exit door of the European Union is causing too much consternation in Brussels over whether these new tech tax proposals will ever be implemented. The EU commissioner behind today's proposals has told me \"there is no blocking attitude from the UK\". Pierre Moscovici said that whilst Britain remained a member of the EU, he expected Philip Hammond to play a positive role in supporting the changes. He also said that he believed the plans could be agreed by the end of the year - before Britain departs - and would be discussed tomorrow at the EU summit which will be attended by Theresa May. Some will say Mr Moscovici's timetable is overly-ambitious, and that gaining agreement from all the EU member states will prove difficult. His answer to that? That the political direction of travel is clear, voters want to see digital giants like Facebook and Google pay more tax. And here is a thought through plan to do it.

The proposals require backing from the European Parliament and the 28 EU countries, but they are divided on the issue. EU tax reforms need the backing of all member states to become law. Ireland has warned that the proposals may not yield more tax, while some countries believe smaller companies should also face a bill. The business practices of big tech firms are facing growing scrutiny in Europe. Competition regulators have fined Apple and Amazon, while Google is appealing against a record \\u20ac2.4bn fine for abusing its dominance to favour its own shopping services. EU agencies are also set to tighten rules on data privacy, while Germany has introduced big fines for social media firms who fail to take down extreme content quickly enough.  ] ",

The slow-release tablet could free patients from having to take daily medication, they say. It looks like a normal capsule, but on reaching the stomach its coating dissolves and a special structure packed inside unfolds. This 4cm (1.5in) star-shaped scaffold stays in the stomach for seven days, steadily releasing its cargo of drugs. More tests in other mammals, including monkeys, are recommended but the researchers say trials in people could begin within two years.    HIV experts said the prospect of a new treatment option was to be welcomed, but that a once-a-week HIV pill for people was \"still a way off\".  Image copyrightGiovanni Traverso  The star is too large to move out of the stomach but still allows food to journey through to the small intestine. Once it has delivered its payload, the star begins to degrade and passes on through the digestive tract. In the pig trial, the researchers dosed it with enough of three antiretroviral drugs - dolutegravir, rilpivirine and cabotegravir - to last for seven days. The researchers say, in the future, the oral drug delivery device could be used for a wide range of diseases, not just HIV.  Slow release Preliminary tests in pigs have already been done with a malaria drug called ivermectin and the star remaining in the stomach for up to two weeks. Researcher Giovanni Traverso, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brigham and Women's Hospital in the US, said: \"We wanted to come up with a system to make it easier for patients to stick to taking their treatments. \"Changing a medication so it only needs to be taken once a week rather than once a day should be more convenient and improve compliance. \"Once-a-month formulations might even be possible for some diseases.\" A company called Lyndra is now developing the technology and plans human trials of the long-lasting oral delivery pills within the next 12 months. Tests with HIV medication could begin after that, subject to approval and more animal tests. Dr Traverso said: \"There are lots of patients this could help, including people with dementia or mental health disorders such as schizophrenia.\" Some slow-release drugs could already be given by injection, he said. A spokeswoman from the British HIV Association said: \"This research is still in the early stages of development and there is clearly some way to go from testing in pigs and mathematical modelling to human trials before its effectiveness can be assessed.\" A Terrence Higgins Trust representative said: \"Medical advances have come on leaps and bounds for HIV in the UK in recent years, however we do know that taking a pill each day does present practical barriers for some people living with HIV. \"We welcome the prospect of a treatment that removes these barriers, and presents all people living with HIV with further choice, provided that it is no less effective than current options available.\" The HIV research, published in the journal [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02294-6), was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Brigham and Women's Hospital.  ] ",

Under the scheme, they will offer career advice and guidance to women from organisations and firms across Scotland. A total of 18 leaders have already signed up as mentors. Each will mentor three women for 12 months. The programme was launched on Friday by Scottish Power and CBI Scotland. Organisers hope it will help to narrow the gender pay gap - the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.    Across the UK, men earned 18.4% more than women in April 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  * [What is the gender pay gap?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42918951) CBI Scotland will oversee the programme and help to pair each leader with their three mentees. The full list of mentors/organisations taking part in the scheme is as follows:   CBI Scotland director Tracy Black, who will also act as a mentor, said: \"Many businesses are already doing more to build inclusive working environments that enable people to be their best. \"But we're not there yet. \"While women are joining boards in greater numbers than ever, it's often as non-executive directors. \"These are important roles but they are not the day-to-day leaders of UK firms. We need more women in the senior ranks of our companies. \"Mentoring is an extremely powerful tool in our arsenal - it gives aspiring women the chance to learn leadership skills from the best minds in business and helps them access the kind of networks that can too often feel closed off to them.\"  _Want to find out the gender pay gap at your company?

That project aims to encourage a new generation of female leaders. She said: \"I commend Scottish Power and CBI Scotland for launching this initiative and committing to narrowing the gender pay gap in sectors traditionally difficult for women to both enter and progress in. \"I am delighted to see that so many people in leadership roles across industry are pledging their time to help women achieve their potential.\" Under new legislation, UK companies with 250 employees or more are legally required to publish their gender pay gap by 4 April, while the deadline for the public sector is 30 March. Two weeks before the deadline, more than 6,000 firms had not disclosed the average difference between what they pay male and female employees.  ] ",

The consumer programme's focus on Tuesday was the issue of gender pay following [Carrie Gracie's resignation as the BBC's China editor.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42601477) The BBC confirmed it had replaced Robinson due to impartiality issues. Gracie left her post, citing pay inequality with male international editors earning more than her. Gracie's resignation prompted an [urgent question in the House of Commons](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42624709) on Tuesday over accusations of unfair pay at the BBC.    The new Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock, told MPs: \"the BBC must not only uphold - but be a beacon for - the British values of fairness that this nation holds dear. That includes fair pay and equal pay for equal jobs. \"   * [Culture secretary says BBC must act over gender pay gap](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42624709)   * [Reality check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42611725)   * [Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42580194)  The BBC's head of news, Fran Unsworth, said the issue of pay was a \"priority\" for the corporation. It is understood that Winifred Robinson was taken off air for Tuesday's edition of the consumer affairs show only - and will resume presenting the programme according to the Radio 4 schedule.

Image copyrightPAImage caption Gracie, who has worked at the BBC for 30 years, is returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London  She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom in London \"where I expect to be paid equally\". Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to \\xa3180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been \"a big gap between myself and my male peers\". [On Twitter, she said she would receive a salary of \\xa3145,000 when she returned to her role on the BBC News Channel](https://twitter.com/BBCCarrie/status/950792798311206914) on 29 January. Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had also tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalist Jane Martinson, from a separate location.  'BBC pay equality is vital' BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be \"exposed to conflicts of interest\", and there must be \"editorial separation\" of those reporting the story. [The UK's equality watchdog is to write to the BBC following the resignation of Gracie.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42616152) The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would consider whether further action is required based on the corporation's response. In a statement, the new BBC's head of news, Fran Unsworth, said: \"BBC pay equality is vital. This issue has been the subject of a lot of debate, both on the BBC and elsewhere, over the past 24 hours.\" Unsworth added: \"Everyone at the BBC has wanted to do this as quickly as possible, but equally, we need to get it right.\" She said she anticipated the BBC audit into presenter pay, which the corporation is working on with accounting firm PWC, would be published by the end of this month. \"The report will help inform a new pay policy at the BBC,\" she said.  'Right to speak out'  Image caption Evan Davis has been vocal about equal pay on Twitter  During Tuesday's Commons debate, Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow in east London, asked: \"[The Secretary] has the power to give a direction to the BBC about equality of opportunity, so will he use that to ensure every member of staff - male or female - at the BBC is able to express their freedom of expression at work and protect their right to speak out as the best way to get transparency?\" Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley, added: \"Evan Davis took to presenting Newsnight to talk about this last night, after going on Twitter and giving his very clear opinion... about this issue. \"Why has he not been silenced when women who have spoken up as part of the campaign group have been taken off air?\" Davis discussed the issue with employment lawyer Jennifer Miller and former director of news at BBC World, Sian Kevill, on Monday night. He had posted a series of tweets giving his views about equal pay at the BBC on the same day.   Skip Twitter post by @EvanHD  > The BBC needs to sort this issue out!

In a tweet, he said he had told the Democrats \"to re-do and send back in proper form!\" The White House said Mr Trump could not declassify the Democrats' memo because of \"sensitive passages\" that created \"concerns for national security\". A congressional panel had voted unanimously to make it public. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Mr Trump of trying to hide the truth about \"the Trump-Russia scandal\".    But Mr Trump said the Democrats had included material that they knew would have to be redacted in order to \"blame the White House for lack of transparency\". Democrats say their memo corrects errors and omissions in the Republican memo, which Mr Trump approved.  * [Key parts of Republican memo - and what it means](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42827167) He defied warnings from the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) when he allowed it to be released at the beginning of the month. The document alleges the agency abused its power by investigating a Trump adviser as part of its inquiry into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  How does the White House justify blocking the Democratic response? White House Counsel Don McGahn said the president was \"inclined\" to approve the memorandum's release but was \"unable to do so at this time\" because it contained \"numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages\". He gave the explanation in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee's Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, who had overseen the original memo which caused such controversy. Attached was a joint letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray which refers to unspecified information in the Democratic memo for which there are \"significant\" national security or law enforcement concerns. Both documents were obtained and published by the Vox website. Mr McGahn added that the White House was ready to review any revised version of the Democratic memo.  But the Nunes committee deemed the memo safe to publish, right? Yes. The House Intelligence Committee, which is led by Mr Trump's Republicans, voted unanimously on Monday to release the Democrats' 10-page report. That left it up to President Trump to decide whether or not to clear it. [Ms Pelosi issued a statement declaring: \"The president's decision to block the Democratic memo from release is part of a dangerous and desperate pattern](https://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/2918-6/) of cover-up on the part of the president. \"Clearly, the president has something to hide.\" The senior Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, accused Mr Trump on Twitter of double standards, for not blocking the original Republican memo despite the pleas of the justice department and FBI.

The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The move follows Carrie Gracie's [resignation as BBC China editor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42598775) in protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Humphrys said he would be earning \"hugely less\" than the \\xa3600,000 he was. The move comes after the BBC [revealed the pay of on-air talent earning over \\xa3150,000](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40653861) in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men.     ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05w6xdm.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionJohn Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' Humphrys, the presenter on Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Mastermind, was revealed to have earned between \\xa3600,000 and \\xa3649,999 in 2016/17. He refused to confirm or deny reports that his pay packet had been halved, to \\xa3250,000-\\xa3300,000, but did say his new salary would be \"a lot less than \\xa3600,000\". He said he had, in fact, taken a total of three pay cuts. \"It seemed fair,\" he told BBC News. \"The BBC used to have, in the good old days, an awful lot of money. \"It no longer has an awful lot of money. I was earning a lot of money and it seemed entirely proper to me that I should take a few pay cuts.\" Of the six men, Radio 2 and Eggheads presenter Jeremy Vine was the best-paid of the group, earning between \\xa3700,000-\\xa3749,999 in 2016/17. Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, earned the least, in the \\xa3200,000-\\xa3249,999 bracket - compared to Carrie Gracie's \\xa3135,000-a-year salary.   The BBC did not comment how much the presenters would now receive. A BBC statement said: \"We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. \"These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. \"The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course.\"  Image copyrightPAImage caption Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor  On his way into work at Radio 2 on Friday, Vine was asked by reporters why he had agreed to a lower wage. \"I think it needs to be sorted out and I support my female colleagues who have rightly said they should be paid the same when they're doing the same job,\" he said. \"It's just a no-brainer, so it wasn't a problem for me to accept one [a pay cut].\" An independent audit into equal pay at the BBC will be published next week. When the list of the best-paid BBC presenters that was published last summer, Chris Evans was at the top, earning between \\xa32.2m and \\xa32.25m in 2016/2017. The highest-paid woman, Claudia Winkleman, earned significantly less - between \\xa3450,000 and \\xa3500,000.    BBC media editor Amol Rajan said while competition in the entertainment industry had intensified, the opposite had happened in news. \"Many of those now taking pay cuts secured generous deals years ago,\" he said. \"That world has disappeared - and these presenters now accept that a chunk of their salaries will have to disappear with it.\"  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05w5v1s.jpg) Media playback is unsupported on your device      Media captionJeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be \"paid equally\". She is due to appear before a select committee of MPs on Wednesday next week, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. They were called to discuss what action the corporation is taking to address the gender pay gap. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: \"While it is admirable that these BBC presenters want to show solidarity for their female colleagues by taking a pay cut, it doesn't address the fundamental issues of pay inequality that Carrie Gracie and others have raised.\" He added that they would hear from Gracie and senior BBC figures at the committee session. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC:   * A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. It [found the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/reports/gender_pay_gap_report.pdf), against a national average of 18.1%   * A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was \"no question of any systemic gender discrimination\"   * A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week  Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be \"an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation\".    _Follow us on_[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/) _, on Twitter_[@BBCNewsEnts](https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts) _, or on Instagram at_[bbcnewsents](https://www.instagram.com/BBCNewsEnts/) _.

Northamptonshire County Council is in talks with Public Health England about the possible \"claw-back\" of up to \\xa310m. It comes after the authority [voted for almost \\xa340m in budget cuts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-43226339). Conservative council leader Heather Smith said the money \"may have been spent in adult social care\". She added: \"It is debatable whether that was a public health need or not.\"    The county council received more than \\xa370m in funding from Public Health England over a two-year period. It was meant to be used only for specific purposes, such as health education and smoking cessation services. A county council spokesman confirmed discussions with Public Health England were ongoing around \"how the public health grant was used within public services\" during 2015-16 and 2016-17. Mrs Smith said any repayments would be staged over a number of years. The news was disclosed to councillors by officers during closed-door sessions in the run-up to the recent budget, which approved cuts to library services and bus subsidies. Mrs Smith said the money \"may have been spent in adult social care, looking after people in some way or another\".  Image caption County council leader Heather Smith said money from the Public Health England grant \"may have been spent on adult social care\"  Opposition Labour finance spokesman Mick Scrimshaw said: \"Everybody knows the county council has financial problems and in particular around the issues of funding for adult social care, but it beggars belief.\" He said councillors were not given specifics regarding \"the allegations of misspending,\" but were told the amount involved may be \"significantly more\" than the original figure of \\xa310m mentioned. Last month, the county council brought in a section 114 notice preventing all new expenditure in 2017/18, except on services for the most vulnerable. Kettering MP Philip Hollobone told the House of Commons the [issuing of the notice meant Northamptonshire \"becomes the worst-run in the country\"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42957438).  Image caption Next year's county council budget will see \\xa339.2m of cuts made, including the closure of 21 small libraries  \"Whether that decision was right or wrong will come out,\" she said, but added that the money \"wasn't misappropriated\". \"At the end of the day it's still being spent on the people in Northamptonshire,\" she said. Public Health England confirmed talks were taking place with the council, but added it could not confirm the sums involved \"until discussions are concluded\". The director of public health in Northamptonshire between May 2013 and April 2017, Dr Akeem Ali, said there were attempts to access public health money by other departments within the county council \"without using the application process\".  'Open and transparent' He added: \"I did not sign off inappropriate use of Public Health Grant while I was director of public health.\" Papers for the [county council's cabinet meeting](https://cmis.northamptonshire.gov.uk/cmis5live/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=GsBED9lvjm1PlyNmyorouQVl5I%2fRKlm6Vokb2NYoq1B%2bnekg172Wsw%3d%3d&rUzwRPf%2bZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3d%3d=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2fLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3d%3d&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3d%3d=hFflUdN3100%3d&kCx1AnS9%2fpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3d%3d=hFflUdN3100%3d&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2bAJvYtyA%3d%3d=ctNJFf55vVA%3d&FgPlIEJYlotS%2bYGoBi5olA%3d%3d=NHdURQburHA%3d&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3d&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3d&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3d) on Tuesday show the authority is planning to bring its outsourced public health delivery vehicle, First for Wellbeing, back in-house. One reason given for this is that Public Health England is \"reviewing the historic and current use of the Public Health grant\". A county council spokesman said the authority was unable to confirm who authorised for the grant to be spent on other services \"while discussions are ongoing\". He added the council's new director of public health and Public Health England \"are being full, open and transparent with each other,\" but said he could not provide detail publicly on the amount of money involved.  ] ",

The choice of attire is in support of the Time's Up initiative, the movement against sexual harassment founded by several Hollywood figures. A letter circulated around the British film and TV industry invited those attending the Baftas to take part. It follows a similar demonstration of support at the Golden Globe Awards earlier this year. The request has already gathered support from UK stars expected to attend the awards and other industry figures.    The list is understood to include Emma Thompson, Daisy Ridley, Emma Watson, Gemma Arterton, Keira Knightley, Jodie Whittaker, Emilia Clarke, Noma Dumezweni, Natalie Dormer and Felicity Jones. The letter urged guests \"to wear black to the awards ceremony, to follow suit from our sisters who attended the Golden Globes\".  'Silenced and marginalized' It invited men attending the Baftas who wish to show their support for the Time's Up movement to wear \"special pins and/or a button hole\". The female industry figures behind the initiative continued: \"More than half of all women and nearly two-thirds of women [in the UK] aged 18 to 24 have experienced sexual harassment at work. \"We hope that those of us privileged enough to have a platform can use it to raise awareness of the experiences of women beyond our industry, whose experiences are often silenced and marginalized.\" Joanna Lumley is the presenter of this year's award ceremony. It will be the first time in over a decade that the Baftas have been hosted by a woman. The event will take place at the Royal Albert Hall on 18 February.  ] ",
