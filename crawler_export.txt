The ban, which came into effect on Thursday, is part of a policy that, the government says, is in line with a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 that said teaching English may hinder the students' proficiency in Korean.  \\\"According to many English education experts and neuroscientists, the right age for learning English as a second language is the third grade,\\\" Kwon Ji- young, director of early childhood education and care policy division at the Ministry of Education, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Starting second-language education at preschool is too early. Before that, social skills and cognitive development should take place. A lot of parents think earlier the better when it comes to learning a second language.\\\"  In South Korea, kindergartens that conduct English classes are not officially registered as pre-schools but operate as private academies.

In Korean society, the more money you have, the more educated you can be,\\\" said Kim Hee- won, a private English teacher.  Kim, who has been teaching in the capital Seoul since 2003, ruled out English learning having an adverse effect on a child's proficiency in Korean.  She did, however, warn of the increase in demand for English institutions and also of the competitiveness that exists among parents.   {articleGUID}   \\\"In Korea, some mothers compare what kind of stroller they have for their kids, which hospital their child was born in and how they want to follow the trends.  \\\"The level of competition is very fierce, and they will spend a lot of money to ensure their child gets taught English.\\\"  Hwang Hee-jung, a single mother to Ko Jae-joon, agrees. Her son was born in the US and was studying in a Korean school in Seoul until last year when she transferred him to an international school.  \\\"I think speaking English is very important because the university admission exam we have\\\\xa0is very tough and students need to get a high score in English to pass,\\\" said Hwang.  \\\"In a Korean school, my son was taught English just one hour a week. Now, majority of his lessons are in English, and the more he practises, the better he will get.\\\"       ---   How an exam brings South Korea to a halt      Together with the ban, the ministry has issued a warning and reminder to Korean parents, urging them to treat English as a second language.  \\\"It's important how parents perceive English as a second language. Korean children are exposed to stressful learning conditions due to academic pressure. It even starts before they are born,\\\" said Kwon.  \\\"The Ministry tries to conduct programmes and seminars for parents to improve their perception of English education.\\\"  A Ministry of Education official, who wished to remain anonymous, said there would be plans put in place for children from low-income families.  \\\"The Ministry has plans which include offering financial help to attend English programmes and assisting schools which lack resources to create those programmes,\\\" the official said.   {articleGUID}   Mobile phone apps and online translation software are being increasingly used for basic communication.  But critics say English fluency is needed more than ever, especially in a society where long hours and extra effort often does not result in success due to the level of competition.  Korean parents will seek private lessons for their children in the aftermath, said one parent, before adding that the assurances handed out by the government will not count for much.  \\\"We will encounter the unavoidable gap between the haves and the have-nots.

Primary education became free in 1961 and the 1980s saw major reforms swept through the education system, including restructuring primary and secondary education and introducing vocational classes.  In September 2017, the Ghanaian government made secondary education free, with\\\\xa0President\\\\xa0[Nana Akufo- Addo](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/talktojazeera/2017/11/akufo-addo- africa-march-democracy-hard-reverse-171124113644826.html)\\\\xa0reportedly saying: \\\"There will be no admission fees, no library fees, no science centre fees, no computer laboratory fees, no examination fees, no utility fees. There will be free textbooks, free boarding and free meals.\\\"  The benefits of the Ghanian government's focus on [education](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/education.html) are reflected in the country's rising literacy rate. According to UNESCO statistics from 2010, the literacy rate among 15-24-year-olds is 85.72 percent, compared with 34.89 percent in those aged 65 or older.   {articleGUID}   Despite these measures, many children, particularly those living in rural areas, struggle to stay in school.  Economic necessity forces children to drop out of school in search of work, and girls are often charged with looking after younger siblings and helping with domestic work.  NGOs are attempting to address these issues at the community level and ensure every child has access to education.  Johnson Ayonka is the director of the Grassroots Transparency Initiative at WillWay Africa, an NGO that supports low-income communities in health, education and economic empowerment.  Jo Hallett works with Ghana School Aid and Let's Read Ghana to provide grants to schools in rural communities and support the teaching of English in the far north of the country.  Al Jazeera spoke with Ayonka and Hallett about the realities of getting an education in Ghana today.   **Al Jazeera: What effect has the recent removal of secondary school fees had on both children and schools?**   **Johnson Ayonka:** It has had an impact, but because the national government is inefficient, the money from the central government doesn't always get to the communities. In the very poor communities, there is the wider problem of poverty that's forcing people to drop out, despite education being free and some schools are still charging fees because the money from the government didn't get to them.  Even though the intention behind the policy was good, the government was not well prepared to implement it to the fullest. They also tried to implement it from the centre, instead of from the local area and the money was not made available in advance. It was sort of \\\"putting the cart before the horse\\\", instead of the money being there before the policy, the policy comes and then the money.  The policy is OK, the students have enrolled because they know that they'll get free education, but after that, we find out that nothing effective takes place because what is needed is not there because of bureaucracy and inefficiency.   **Al Jazeera: What are the barriers still preventing access to education today?**   **Jo Hallett:** In the last few years, there has also been quite a push on more school buildings and a big push on enrolment and I think that [the Ghanaian government has] done very well on getting the vast majority of children into school, [but] there are huge barriers to accessing education. There's a serious lack of trained teachers. In many of the schools we go into, the majority of the staff are volunteers or student teachers.  There's a lack of finance for schools in general, so although the children are there, the buildings are not there, although overall they have improved, lots of schools have either very poor buildings or no buildings at all; they call it \\\"under the tree\\\" so classes are taught under a tree. There's a lack of equipment and a lack of books and resources, the training of teachers, finance of all sorts and that needs to be addressed.  Often the teachers don't get paid for several months because the District Education doesn't have the finance to pay them and, therefore, there's a lack of commitment on their part to some extent. Class sizes also vary enormously. A good teacher can manage quite a big class but sometimes it's overwhelming: you go into a classroom and there are 70 pupils in there and one teacher who may not be trained, who's trying to manage them and it's impossible really, it's really difficult.  > There's a lack of finance for schools in general, so although the children are there, the buildings are not there ... lots of schools have either very poor buildings or no buildings at all.\\\\r > > Jo Hallett, NGO worker > >   **  Al Jazeera: How are rural communities affected?**   **Hallett:** In many rural areas, the families are involved in subsistence farming or illegal mining and, with farming, the children get pulled out of school for harvest and sewing.  Another really significant thing that we see is the complete lack of spoken English in the rural areas. In school, after the first couple of years, the education is in English. There are 52 languages in Ghana, but the common language, and the language of government, [and] the language they're expected to learn in is English.  If you live in a town, the chances are that you will see English sometimes and hear it, but out in the rural areas where we go in the far north, they speak a language called Guruni, which is spoken in a very small area, and it's not written down at all so there aren't any signposts or posters so [children] don't have text in the environment, either in their own language or in English.   **Al Jazeera: Do girls face additional challenges to entering education?**   **Ayonka:** \\\\xa0At the primary level the gender gap is small, it's very, very small, and that indicates that a lot of progress has been made in the education of girls. But as girls mature into their teenage years, they face a lot of challenges because there's a lot of gender disparity in terms of who should do house chores, so girls suffer more.   {articleGUID}   When you get closer to higher levels of education, even though the gap has reduced over the years, it's still there because cultural factors come into play and there are issues of early marriage and families spending more on boys than on girls.  We need something to address that gap because it will relieve the economic aspects of education and leave the responsibility to the government so that families don't have to decide: \\\"Are we going to educate the boy and leave the girl out? Or are we going to educate both?\\\"   **Al Jazeera: What steps should the government take now?**   **Ayonka:** What we see recently from the government is that a lot of policies and actions are done in isolation. Let's say you see an area where there's a high instance of teenage pregnancy and you don't also make arrangements for the education authorities to work with the healthcare authorities and social workers; even though there's free education, you are still going to get low enrolment because there is no coordination.  Another problem is the issue of access to the education infrastructure, there's free education on paper but the schools are few, especially in the rural areas. You can say you want to give free education to people but if you don't give them physical access to the schools by building more schools, then you still don't have free education ... I think communities need to be empowered to build their own schools, to recruit their own teachers, monitor the teachers and make sure that the standard of education is high.  There's a big gap between what is happening at the government level and what is happening at the community level.   **Hallett:\\\\xa0** There needs to be a bigger commitment to funding and a raising of the status of teachers. [The government] has done some really good things, some of the curriculum books are excellent, but they also need to have a bit of money and resources to back up that commitment, but I do think Ghana is trying hard. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Q&A: The reality of free education for all in Ghana\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/qa-reality-free-education-ghana-180219070207774.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **London -** Ben Bennett remembers sitting in the back of his family's car at the age of four, on his way home from primary school, feeling utterly bewildered.

Ben **\\\\xa0** was expelled from his school in Doncaster a decade ago, after trying to defend himself from a physical attack that his family believes was racially charged.  The incident sent Ben, who is an English Romany Gypsy, down a path of educational instability and discontent. In the ensuing years, he passed through 11 different schools, facing harassment and a second expulsion\\\\xa0at the age of 12. Eventually, Ben's parents decided to home-school him after a group of boys attacked him earlier this year, leaving him with a broken hand.  \\\"I'd always get racial backlash for being who I am and I'd always get punished for being myself,\\\" Ben, who lives in Nottinghamshire, told Al Jazeera. \\\"People would call me a dirty, filthy gyppo and say, 'My mummy and daddy said I can't play with you because you're a pikey and you'll rob my bike.' Teachers would also say they don't feel comfortable teaching me.\\\"  His 15-year-old sister, Anastasia, was also expelled\\\\xa0twice - at the ages of four and six - and endured persistent racist bullying.  \\\"I was left wondering, at just four years old, what was wrong with me,\\\" she said, noting that her first expulsion\\\\xa0was triggered by an incorrect claim that she had stolen a toy from school. \\\"It laid the foundations of an unhappy few years. I felt very low in myself. It was really painful.\\\"  Anastasia also attended 11 different schools, but is now doing well in an alternative education programme at college.

In its\\\\xa0[Race Disparity Audit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/650723/RDAweb.pdf), published in October, the UK government highlighted the scale of the problem,\\\\xa0[noting ](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/630645/SFR35_2017_main_tables.xlsx)that Gypsy or Roma schoolchildren are more than four times as likely - and Irish Traveller pupils more than three times as likely - as their white British peers to receive suspensions. In addition, Gypsy or Roma children are more than three times as likely as white British children to be expelled, and Irish Traveller children nearly five times as likely.  The UK government has announced an external review to improve the way in which schools execute suspensions and expulsions, with a spokesperson noting that \\\"any decision to exclude should be lawful, reasonable and fair\\\" and citing the need to focus on \\\"the experiences of those groups who are disproportionately likely to be excluded\\\".    Quick facts  \\\\- Seventy percent of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) children experience discrimination in some aspect of education.   \\\\- GRT pupils are more likely to be suspended or expelled from school in the UK than children of any other ethnicity.   \\\\- Gypsy or Roma children are more than four times as likely, and Irish Traveller children more than three times as likely, as white British children to receive suspensions.   \\\\- Gypsy or Roma children are more than three times as likely, and Irish Traveller children nearly five times as likely, as white British children to be expelled.   \\\\- GRT pupils have the lowest educational attainment and progress of all ethnic groups throughout their school years, and are least likely to stay in education after the age of 16.   Some observers contend that the high rate of suspensions and expulsions among GRT pupils is not just a result of challenging behaviour by the affected students, but outright discrimination.  Rosie Toohey, a 19-year-old Irish Traveller living in London, remembers spending a lot of time in isolation and completing five-day suspensions on numerous occasions.  \\\"The exclusions are more down to racism and bullying than a child wanting to leave school,\\\" said Toohey, who is now studying at university and working as a volunteer with GRT children facing the possibility of expulsion. \\\"It's more down to them not being able to go to school because of who they are.\\\"  Sarah Mann, co-director of the charity\\\\xa0[Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT)](https://www.gypsy-traveller.org/), told Al Jazeera that the reasons behind the \\\"shocking and unacceptable\\\" expulsion and suspension rates\\\\xa0are complex.  \\\"Every child has the right to an education, but in many cases, the environment in the classroom can mean that GRT children are unsafe and unprotected from racist bullying,\\\" Mann said.  \\\"Many schools are failing to address this bullying, leaving GRT children with an appalling choice to make: either defend themselves or stop going to school. But when they do stick up for themselves, they are labelled as the problem and get the blame.\\\"   'Made to feel unworthy'  Geetha Marcus, an educational sociologist at the University of Glasgow and author of the book Gypsy and Traveller Girls in the UK: Silence, Agency and Power, said there was also evidence of GRT parents removing their children from school because they feared for their safety.  \\\"A strong theme that came through is that the Traveller girls did not feel safe,\\\" Marcus told Al Jazeera. \\\"Why would you go to a space over and over again where you knew you were going to be persecuted, made to feel unworthy? And their parents want to protect their children; they don't want them to be beaten up, called nasty names, treated badly by teachers in the classroom. It is a legitimate parental concern.

The crisis in the education sector comes despite repeated efforts by successive governments to reform the archaic system.  Meanwhile, social disparity is widening with the growth of private schools as higher-income families increasingly opt to pay for better services, threatening those who rely on free and quality education.  Despite high tuition costs, the number of those shifting from public to private schools soared from 4 percent in 1999 to 15 percent in 2015.  A World Economic Forum report in 2015 placed Morocco at 101 out of 140 countries in a quality of education index.

Anas Mrabti, a high school student at a public school in Rabat, expressed concern over the future of underprivileged pupils.  \\\"It has become very difficult for students at public schools to pursue a decent career,\\\" he told Al Jazeera. \\\"The majority of students at public schools come from poor families, who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools. The dilemma is that there is a big gap between the public and private schools in terms of quality education and services.\\\"  He added that financial disparities could affect higher education.  \\\"Students from public schools find it very difficult to compete with students from private schools to access reputable institutions and universities. Parents normally send their kids to private schools because they know that those schools can earn their kids higher marks,\\\" he said.  Because privately-educated children usually attain better grades, it becomes \\\"very difficult for students from public schools to \\\\u2026 access major universities and institutions,\\\" said the student.\\\\xa0   'Students not equipped'   ****In recent years, successive governments have tried to implement structural adjustments to increase access to education and improve the education system's performance, the latest of which is the Council of Education's \\\"Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School\\\".  This strategy was first implemented in 2015 and is expected to continue until 2030.\\\\xa0  But so far, there have been few solutions.  According to Mohammed, a headmaster of a public school in Tetouan who declined to give his last name, \\\"the educational field has been suffering for a while from the gap between theory and practice, and of the gap between ideas and application\\\".  He told Al Jazeera: \\\"Students are not equipped with the practical skills they need to integrate them into the job market.  \\\"Our public schools are like buildings lacking pillars that keep them standing. Any major reform bid needs to transform goals into practical solutions.\\\"  An academic researcher, who preferred not to give his name, agreed that the Ministry of Education's previous and current attempts at reform were superficial.  \\\"All reform attempts were inspired by Western models that do not take into consideration the possibility of application, and whether the country is ready to apply such reforms on ground.  \\\"The country has its own identity and characteristics. The setup of any effective reform plan can only be achieved through a participatory approach that should include academics, educational syndicates, researchers and trainers.  \\\"Securing logistics and funding are not enough to ensure good educational quality. Public schools used to enjoy a good reputation in the past, and the authorities in this country should restore that dignity by finding solutions for such a vital sector.\\\"  Mohamed Jouji, a retired father who has two daughters in private schools, said Morocco is far from achieving its goals in the public education sector.  \\\"The issues are mainly school dropouts, weak numbers of schooling in the rural world, the high illiteracy rate, and the deterioration of educational performance,\\\" Jouji told Al Jazeera.   The end of free education?   ****Another headache added to the Moroccan burden is a new draft bill introduced by the government, which aims at putting an end to free education in the kingdom.  The bill proposes that preschool, primary and secondary education should remain free of charge for all Moroccans, but suggests registration fees for high schools and universities for middle and high-income families.  The draft law has angered parents and education syndicates, who consider the move a violation of Moroccan citizens' right to free education. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How an education crisis is hurting Morocco's poor\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/education-crisis-hurting-morocco-poor-180306225706337.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Clara Ponsati, Catalonia's former education minister, has turned herself in to authorities in Scotland and is facing extradition to Spain.

It is, of course, unacceptable for any woman to receive less than a man for the same job, in any walk of life or career path. But where equal pay and rights would make the greatest material difference - to education, to health and to economic progress - is at the sharp end of inequality: not in Hollywood, but with rural women in developing countries.  These are the women who make up more than 40 percent of the [agricultural workforce](http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/am307e/am307e00.pdf), performing labour-intensive tasks like raising livestock and hand-weeding, working much longer hours than men when domestic duties are taken into account. Yet these are also the same women often blocked from [land ownership](https://farmingfirst.org/women_infographic/), who get just five percent of agricultural support services, 10 percent of agricultural aid, and can access a fraction of the credit available to invest in their farms and families.\\\\xa0  The difference that just a little extra income or support can make goes beyond the noble goal of equality. Increasing a woman's income by just $10 has the [same positive effect](https://farmingfirst.org/women_infographic/) on her children's nutrition and health as increasing a man's income by $110.  > Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet. But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   And with equal access to the same resources as men, the benefits stretch even further to transforming millions of lives and prospects. Women farmers typically produce 20-30 percent less than men per hectare, not because they are less efficient but because they have less access to training, credit and inputs like improved seeds and fertilizer.  By giving women the same opportunities as men, total agricultural output could be boosted by an additional four percent. This is equivalent of ending malnutrition for up to 150 million people in the world.  The value of closing the gender gap in agriculture has been demonstrated in places like Bangladesh, where a Dutch-funded project helps train female farmers to become local leaders, or Farm Business Advisors (FBA).  Led by [iDE and partners](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.ideglobal.org/files/public/IDE- B_PROOFS_Photobook-2017.pdf?mtime=20170531154634), these FBAs develop networks across the agricultural supply chain to help farmers better access key materials and markets, and generate more income. It has helped women like [Jahanara Begum](https://farmingfirst.org/2018/03/fillthegap-joining-up-women- for-a-common-goal-in-bangladesh/), 45, bridge the gender gap not only by developing her own seed-selling business and unlocking new credit lines, but by equipping her to support other farmers across more than 250 producer groups.\\\\xa0  The project organises activities like post-harvest training between buyers and other market players to raise the value of crops, and in turn raise profit margins. In total, the project has seen more than 63,000 households move out of poverty with an increase in income per capita of around $420.  Meanwhile, women account for just a quarter of landowners with official rights in [Mozambique](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/mozambique.html). But when major agricultural trading company EMCL began to recruit and train young women like [Josefina dos Santos Lourenco](https://farmingfirst.org/2018/03 /fillthegap-making-queens-in-mozambique/) to manage their input supply shops, they were able to simultaneously expand their businesses and begin to address the agricultural gender gap.  Thanks to training in bookkeeping and marketing carried out in partnership with Fintrac and USAID, Josefina's inputs shop is now serving almost 1,000 farmers with essential products from appropriate fertilizers to improved seed. \\\"Today, I'm not only financially independent, but also my family is receiving lots of respect in my area,\\\" she told staff at Fintrac.  And in [Colombia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/colombia.html), where women make up 40 percent of the cocoa growers' association COMCACAOT, USAID's Rural Finance Initiative (RFI) has helped re-balance the gender pay gap by helping [individual farmers access loans](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MJHG.pdf). RFI supported COMCACAOT, an organisation that is only five years old, through targeted technical assistance and organizational development training prior submitting a loan request to Banco Agrario de Colombia.  COMCACAOT was able to vouch for 374 of its members, most of whom were women. For female members like Lidia Grueso, who herself had already overcome gender barriers to become a manager of COMCACAOT, such support to access credit allows women to afford critical farm inputs and to pay the staff harvesting the cocoa.  Meanwhile, to reduce the burden of unpaid domestic work for rural women, policy network [FANRPAN](https://www.fanrpan.org/) is working in [Ethiopia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html) and [Tanzania](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/tanzania.html) to make men aware of the need to participate more in household budgeting and chores. Following behaviour change workshops in several villages, men have begun to play a more active role in tending home gardens, collecting water and even attending the village cooking classes. By bringing men into this domain, the often overlooked hours that women work at home can be reduced, bridging yet another aspect of the gender gap facing female farmers.  Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet. But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields. A level playing field for rural women can help plant the seeds for a better life for not only for female farmers and their families, but the entire developing world.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Bridging the gender pay gap, on the red carpet and in the fields\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/bridging-gender-pay-gap-red-carpet-fields-180308124732679.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ On my first day of college, the official who interviewed me for admission sat me down on the steps of the student centre, a newly renovated building surrounded by lush landscaping and stately ivy-covered buildings.

Jacoby urges elites to reject the shame that they have supposedly recently developed, a shame that somehow stems from failing to stop the working class from embracing Trumpism. Jacoby laments that, following the [2016 election](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election-2016.html), these elites no longer take pride in their wealth, their education, their social status, and posits that if only elites embraced their upward mobility, the working class would have something to aspire to and thus discard their fondness for Trump and his promises to save them.  Jacoby's strategy for elevating the working class is not only ahistorical, it's also rooted in a class dynamic that simply does not exist. [As I have argued in the past](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/11/working- class-trump-suppress-161112142432583.html), the working class is not responsible for the rise of Trump. White America, regardless of class status, put Trump in power. Moreover, the working class is a carefully designed byproduct of policy and culture that creates and maintains the ruling class. To be \\\"elite\\\" relies on differentiating oneself from the masses. Wealth and socioeconomic mobility for the elite come at the expense of the working class. It's, therefore, more than strange that Jacoby imagines the rich as the intellectual philanthropists catering to the vacuous working people who just need a little knowledge from above.  > Jacoby's pull yourself up by the bootstraps, trickle-down approach to culture and intellectualism discounts the long legacy and history-in-making of working-class organising against austerity.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   College was the first moment where I truly experienced how wealthy and upwardly mobile people lived. I came from an immigrant family that oscillated between working class and truly poor. The electricity was often cut off, rent checks were late, money was perpetually tight, and in my earliest years in the US, we lived with a revolving door of cousins and relatives, 12 to a four- bedroom house. But I went to good, if overcrowded, New York City public schools and my parents had some time to help with homework. I received good grades, participated in extracurricular activities, got a steady job at the age of 14, and was accepted to excellent colleges. Once I arrived on campus, I struggled. There were few working-class kids at my well-regarded liberal arts school, and even fewer working-class students of colour. Though my public school education had been very good, it was not as rigorous as the schooling my peers had received at expensive private institutions. I found myself working twice as hard for little return. On top of the stress of coursework, the cost of textbooks and computer access meant I was constantly juggling which books I could get away with buying last, or which I could borrow from the library, at the cost of losing points for late assignments. The few students I knew with similar backgrounds had the same experience. I saw many who were unable to pay the cost of tuition leave school and go back home. In the end, I graduated on time and went on to receive a Master's degree from an Ivy League university. Even with two degrees from excellent schools, I spent almost a year working minimum-wage service jobs, saddled with debt, before I found a salaried full-time position that paid $35,000 a year in New York City. Despite my entree into the world of the \\\"elite\\\", I was still solidly working class.  We currently live in a moment of American history in which a college education [does not guarantee entry to the middle class](https://www.brookings.edu/blog /social-mobility-memos/2016/02/19/a-college-degree-is-worth-less-if-you-are- raised-poor/), where upward mobility comes with more hoops and obstacles than it has since the vast expansion of the middle class in the postwar period. The sheer definition of who constitutes the working class is shifting, as has been made evident by the [teachers' strikes](https://t.co/aAV9FfgVB1) in West Virginia and Oklahoma. This is especially true for young people of colour. Young people of colour who attend college [still earn less](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps- persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/) than their white counterparts. And despite high degrees of educational attainment, wealth in these communities is at an [all-time low](http://www.ips-dc.org/report-the-road-to-zero-wealth/). Jacoby's assertion that a college education will lead to class ascendance is patently false, and her claim that the working class is responsible for the rise of [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile- president-donald-trump-161109050153947.html) is an offensive argument, one that allows the white, upper-middle-class readership of the New York Times to wash its hands of the role it plays in creating the class frissions that the author laments - through creating and supporting policies that have kept the rich wealthy, the middle class dwindling, and the poor immiserated.  Jacoby's pull yourself up by the bootstraps, trickle-down approach to culture and intellectualism discounts the long legacy and history-in-making of working-class organising against austerity. In other words, the material gains that poor and working-class people have made come via direct resistance to the rich. She positions the working class as the creators of the Trump era and the elites as heroes in the making, when, in fact, elites are the architects of this political moment. Jacoby is correct in that elites must stop apologising for their education and their status. Beyond apology, what the upper middle class and, in particular, the white upper middle class, owes to this country is a claim of responsibility - responsibility in creating and profiteering from a financial crisis that led to ballooning student debt and stagnant wages, [which especially impacts communities of colour](http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/mar/07/student-loan-debt-crisis- civil-rights-issue/), and responsibility in allowing this nation to become one of the most unequal countries on the planet, all to retain some sort of status as \\\"elite\\\".\\\\xa0  I'm now comfortably middle class. I have debt but I also have a stable income and I'm putting my degrees to work. I know that my class ascendance is not hinged solely on my college education, but on systemic factors (for instance, I'm a documented South Asian immigrant in the US and the child of a college educated parent). As a member of the \\\"elite\\\" that Jacoby refers to, I know that my success was built on the labour of the working classes who fought for people like me. And it's time for those of us who \\\"made it\\\" to carry on that legacy by dismantling the systems that make elitism possible.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Trickle down elitism does not help the working class\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/trickle-elitism-working-class-180320123323326.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ The [Central European University](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/04/hungary-shut- university-170405104057150.html), a Hungarian-American school that has been under fire from Hungary's right-wing government, plans to open a satellite campus in Vienna, Austria.\\\\xa0  \\\"The memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Vienna, which will be presented to our Board of Trustees at the end of this week, is an initial step towards expanding our university's operations,\\\"\\\\xa0said a statement from CEU.

In the weeks following the referendum,\\\\xa0Puigdemont inched closer to his goal for his homeland, becoming the unlikely leader of a movement that started in a tiny town in the Catalan province of Girona.  Almost four weeks after the referendum, Catalonia officially [declared independence](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/catalan-parliament-begins- vote-independence-171027115908493.html), with the Spanish government in Madrid immediately triggering Article 155, which allows the national government to take direct control of\\\\xa0[Catalonia](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/catalonia.html).

At 16, he started working as a reporter for the local newspaper Diari de Girona.  At the University of Girona, Puigdemont studied Catalan philosophy. But he dropped out of university to become a full-time journalist.  After working for years for the now-defunct newspaper El Punt, he became its editor-in-chief in 1988. He wrote for the journal, Presencia and also founded the English-language magazine, Catalonia Today.  In 2006, Puigdemont left journalism to join a Catalan electoral alliance, which later turned into a pro-independence movement. Because of his background in communication, he also helped establish the Catalan News Agency, a \\\"digital native\\\" mouthpiece for the Catalan movement.\\\\xa0  In 2011, he was elected mayor of Girona, the capital of the province of the same name. He was the first politician in 32 years to break the Socialist Party of Catalonia's dominance in the city.\\\\xa0       ---   [THE LISTENING POST: Catalonia referendum - One country, two stories (25:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Q-vnnG_nI&t=2s)     Puigdemont further burnished his political credentials among Catalans by becoming chairman of the Association of Municipalities for Independence and being elected a member of the regional parliament.  On January 10, 2016, he was elected president of Catalonia. He is the first Catalan president to not declare an oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution and the current king, Felipe VI.  Amid criticism from the central government in Madrid for his role in the referendum, Puigdemont managed to push for the vote in the Catalan parliament. The voting was declared unconstitutional by the country's courts.  However, Puigdemont and his supporters were defiant as he pushed for the region's second referendum on independence in three years. Of those that cast their ballots, a majority voted in favour of independence, leading to a political crisis in [Spain](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/spain.html).  On October 27, Catalonia's future once again caused turmoil after the region [declared independence](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/catalan- parliament-begins-vote-independence-171027115908493.html) from Spain.\\\\xa0  Several hours after the declaration, Puigdemont was fired, and his regional government dissolved. The future of Puigdemont and the Catalan independence project is now uncertain.  The day after the declaration, the Spanish prime minister dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for new regional elections on 21 December 2017.  On 30 October Puigdemont and other members of the Catalan government were charged with rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, charges that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years.  On the same day, Puigdemont and five other Catalan ministers fled to Belgium, having left Catalonia right after the charges were laid.  Puigdemont claimed he had gone to \\\"the capital of Europe\\\" to speak from a position of \\\"freedom and safety\\\". He said that he wouldn't return to Spain unless he was guaranteed a fair trial.   On 7 December 2017, about 45,000 Catalan protesters descended on Brussels in support of the exiled president. The protests took place outside EU institutions aiming to put pressure on EU institutions to support the region's cause.  While remaining in self-exile, Puigdemont contested the regional elections on 21 December and was re-elected to Parliament. In the election, Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament.  After the election, Puigdemont called for new unconditional talks with the Spanish government and proposed to meet Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy outside Spain, but the latter rejected the offer.  On 25 March 2018, while travelling from Finland to Brussels by car, Puigdemont was [detained by German police](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03 /catalonia-leader-carles-puigdemont-detained-germany-180325105531050.html) on the border with Denmark.

The training programme was not part of our course and we never thought we would actually use this skill on the job - until one of our classmates, Ivan Flores, used it to help save a man's life while reporting in the South Bronx.  Statistics show that many more journalists can find themselves in a similar situation in the near future. The US is in the middle of an opioid epidemic.\\\\xa0According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2016,\\\\xa0[more than 42,000 people](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html)\\\\xa0died as result of an opioid overdose in the country.\\\\xa0 Today, more people than ever before are dying from opioid overdoses, and [according to experts](https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/27/opioid-deaths-forecast/),\\\\xa0i n the worst case scenario, opioids could kill nearly half a million people across the US over the next decade. \\\\xa0  Whatever happens, journalists will be covering it, and some, like our friend Ivan, will encounter overdoses while doing so.    **Why I carry an anti-overdose kit with me while reporting in America**   _by Ivan Flores_   ---   While working as a photojournalist in Afghanistan, I reserved a spot in my camera bag for my medical kit. When I moved back to New York, I replaced my medical kit for a Narcan kit (a common brand name for Naloxone), which I received for free as part of a training I took in preparation to cover the South Bronx.\\\\xa0  Overdoses have hit the Bronx particularly hard. If it was its own state, the Bronx would have the second-highest drug overdose rate in the country.  This winter, I was interviewing a heroin-user in a park when she pointed over my shoulder. Behind me, her friend had collapsed. His head split open on the curb, blood splattered on the pavement.\\\\xa0The woman said he might be overdosing. She told me they would get high together on occasion.\\\\xa0  The woman, one of my classmates and I ran towards the man with the Narcan in hand.\\\\xa0My classmate handed the woman a dose of Narcan. She inserted the nasal mister into her friend's nose and delivered the dose. But the man remained unconscious. I pulled on my gloves, tipped the man's head back and delivered a second dose from my kit.\\\\xa0 As first responders from the fire department arrived, the man regained consciousness.  He was taken to the hospital to recover. After about 20 more minutes, I wrapped up my interview with the woman whose friend we just witnessed overdosing. She wasn't phased by what she saw.  When I go into the field, carrying my notebook, two batteries for my camera, and a Narcan kit, I'm ready to respond again if the situation calls for it.     In this landscape, we believe journalism schools across the US should include Naloxone training in their curriculum alongside interview techniques, multimedia production, ethics and hostile-environment training for reporters headed to conflict zones.  Undergrad and graduate programmes are well-placed to teach these skills and one journalism professor has already started to do so. This winter, Jillian Bauer-Reese hosted a Naloxone training for students in her course on covering addiction at Temple University.  Bauer-Reese\\\\xa0said the training benefits journalists whether or not they encounter someone experiencing an overdose.\\\\xa0  \\\"Even if they're not going to use it,\\\" she said, \\\"they can better understand how this medication works while reporting on the opioid crisis.\\\"\\\\xa0  Other journalism professors should follow her lead, whether or not they teach reporting on addiction. Few arenas of American life remain untouched by the reach of this public health crisis. Journalists interact with a diverse array of people as part of their work and they are likely to come into contact with drug users in the field, no matter their geographical or topical beat.\\\\xa0  Are journalists and educators - those teaching the next generation of reporters - willing to step up? So far, few have. Last year, the news website Billy Penn [hosted a Naloxone training](http://kleincamp.com/2017/10/24 /narcan-training-journalists/) for a dozen journalists in Philadelphia. But in universities across the US, we have not found a single journalism programme that offers the training as part of the curriculum.  The deans of our own graduate programme have said they support the idea. Associate Dean Andrew Mendelson has already asked CUNY's legal office if it would be possible to hold the training as a workshop or part of graduate programme orientation.  \\\"The professional norms of journalism are always in flux,\\\" Mendelson said. \\\"I think the profession should be interrogating itself when new opportunities come about. What does it mean that we can carry life-saving medicine along with us when we're doing reporting?\\\"  To some, this question does not have a straightforward answer.  Some journalists believe that they have an ethical duty to remain rigidly detached from the individuals on whom they report - even in a life and death situation like an overdose. While others believe that Naloxone training is not necessary for journalists, as it will not do much to help stop the opioid epidemic in the US.  Kelly McBride, vice president at the Poynter Institute for journalism training and an expert on media ethics, for example, worries that giving Naloxone training to journalists may have a negative side effect.   Carrying medicine that can save an individual \\\"may make you more likely to focus your efforts on those individual narratives,\\\" she told us. This may cause journalists to ignore time-consuming, data-driven stories that would be more effective in holding actors accountable across government, insurance, first responders and drug companies, she added.\\\\xa0Individual accounts of addiction are powerful, McBride said, but \\\"they do very little to move the needle in the public understanding.\\\"   {articleGUID}   While McBride is right to insist on accountability journalism, we believe giving Naloxone training to journalists will improve the quality of the overall coverage of the opioid crisis. By learning how opioids affect the body and how to recognise signs of an overdose, journalists will gain practical knowledge that can't be gained from parsing a spreadsheet or interviewing an expert. This will provide them with valuable insight into the subject that they are covering.\\\\xa0  And most importantly, as more people grow addicted to opioids, the last resort for many may be the chance presence of a stranger carrying this simple medication -\\\\xa0And in some cases, that stranger can be a journalist.  The cost of this preparation is small. Keeping Naloxone kits in our bags takes no more effort than carrying the extra batteries our instructors remind us to bring with us to the field. We may never need to use the Naloxone kit as we may never need those extra batteries - but in case we do, we'll be thankful to have it.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the authors' own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"US journalism students should undergo anti-overdose training\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/journalism-students-undergo-anti-overdose-training-180315125055224.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Karachi, Pakistan-** A minor girl's rape and murder earlier this month has sent a shock wave across [Pakistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/pakistan.html).

According to Sahil, a non-government organization working on the problem of child sexual assaults, 1,764 cases of child abuse were reported in the first half of 2017 alone.  In at least 62 of such cases, children were murdered after being sexually abused. In most cases, the attacker was an acquaintance of the victim.  As chilling CCTV footage emerged showing Zainab walking hand in hand with her attacker in her final moments, public discourse shifted from protests to a call for preventive measures to protect all children from sexual abuse.  \\\"Even before the incident, I had been teaching my child about possible child abuse scenarios. I have told her to not talk to strangers and be aware of traps,\\\" said Umair Arif, father of a four-year-old, who joined the protesters in the port city of Karachi.  \\\"I have made her learn our house address and our phone number.\\\"   'Child Abuse Awareness'  As public voices grew, the government in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, announced plans to introduce \\\"Child Abuse Awareness' in its curriculum\\\".  In Pakistan, any discussion on sex, including sex education, is taboo and prompts resistance from the conservative section of the society.  The government has deliberately steered clear of talking about \\\"sex education\\\", but right-wing political groups have already warned the government against inserting \\\"obscenity\\\" in textbooks in the name of \\\"child abuse awareness\\\".  \\\"Sex abuse prevention education is a necessity of the day but there should be some checks that obscenity isn't taught in its name,\\\" Farid Piracha of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan 9s largest Islamic party, told Al Jazeera. \\\"The purpose should be propagation of ethical and religious lifestyle,\\\" he said.  The government insists it is not going for the westernisation of sexual education.  \\\"We will educate our children about what advances should they stop, obviously it won't be sex education, but it will be more about the safety measures that can be taken, sort of good touch bad touch kind of learning,\\\" Malik Ahmed Khan, the spokesperson for the Punjab government, told Al Jazeera.  The government in southern Sindh province has also come forward with a plan to implement what it calls \\\"life skills based education\\\" and \\\"child abuse awareness programme\\\" with immediate effect.  The programme which was first launched as a pilot project in collaboration with Aahung - a non-government organisation - will be made part of school curriculum all across Sindh by April 2018.   Questions and doubts  But Arif is concerned as a parent. \\\"I do not trust the education system in Pakistan,\\\" he told Al Jazeera.  While he agrees that child abuse awareness is very important, he is not comfortable with it being taught to children under 10 years of age by ill- trained teachers.  \\\"Children are innocent and my experience with my four-year-old is that if you tell her don 9t do something she might be more interested in doing it and that can make the issue worse,\\\" Arif said.  Some parents are also concerned that this might be a glorified version of sex education.  Aisha Ijaz, the programme manager at Aahung said this was not the case. \\\"I wouldn't say it is sex education. We call it life skills based education. It is tailored to the issues that we see in our society,\\\" she told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Our content was reviewed in 2012 by a group of parents, teachers and even some very progressive religious scholars went through the content and said there is nothing inappropriate about it, it should be taught to young people,\\\" Ijaz told Al Jazeera.   More than just the curriculum  Jamil believes child abuse awareness in schools is \\\"imperative\\\" but greater effort is needed to fight abuse effectively. She was one of the first to share Zainab 9s news on social media and has been working with child abuse survivors for years.  \\\"To parents and teachers, I really want to say please talk to children. The world is a frightening place. Teach them how to recognise danger. Be their safe house. Listen to them. Or they will lose their voice,\\\" she said.  Jamil hopes to see deeper understanding of the matter and a more holistic approach in educating children.  \\\"No man is born a rapist. It takes a very dead soul to rape a child,\\\" she told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Teach kindness and empathy and respect of all bodies, of all living things, of all nature.

Are some of us waiting for science to come up with some new technology that will magically solve the problem, as I suspect many people are anxiously hoping for a discovery that will stop [climate change](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/climate-change.html)? Are we waiting for the enfranchised masses to vote for \\\"change\\\", for the next radical option presented to them? For a revolution?  Or do we think that corporate and political leaders will finally be moved towards enlightened collective interest all of a sudden?  I'm afraid the answer to the last one is that, beyond some notable exceptions, there is no appeal for capitalist elites to be\\\\xa0nice _._ \\\\xa0Business ethics are either imposed by regulation or else they exist off-balance-sheet, maybe on a voluntary basis - something that companies can pick up and pay lip service to when necessary.  Instead, we need to look to the business trailblazers like those leading innovative models based upon equity - worker-owned companies such as the multibillion-dollar Mondragon in Spain and Amul in India, for example.  Or those willing to consider a visionary idea. We are putting the case to business leaders that they should not pay a penny in shareholder dividends and executive bonuses until all their workers are getting a living wage and their producers a fair price.\\\\xa0  We do not have the patience to wait or hope. We need to look to the law. And new laws must be pushed into existence by the collective power of people.  We will only close the gap between men and women's pay by legislating it closed. At the speed we're going now, it will take 217 years. Iceland has caught on.  We need to throw the book at irresponsible corporate tax behaviour which alone costs poor countries $100bn a year. That book needs to hit the corporate lobbyists while we're at it.  We need to be less worried about disruptive new technologies, but more proactive in understanding and harnessing them properly. The utility of every invention depends on how it is owned and controlled for the public good.  Law has the power to ensure that nobody should work on a level of pay that they cannot live a decent life.\\\\xa0  This means governments getting back into the driving seat. In days gone by, governments would value the masses because they needed them for their factories and armies, and so they would feed, educate and keep them healthy. That's changed today.\\\\xa0  Then we were sold the idea that trade-fuelled growth would spread around the world, carried by democracy, on a rising tide that would \\\"lift up all boats\\\". That's failed, too.  The unspoken contract between the elites and the 99 percent that unfettered market globalisation and liberalisation should benefit us all is broken.  Globalisation has lifted many people out of the most abject poverty and we celebrate that. But it has been even more successful in boosting an elite few into superyachts stuffed with stupendous wealth, while dumping hundreds of millions of people onto the flotsam and jetsam at the bottom.  We are beginning to be left to trust that those at the top will rescue those below.  But the worst-case scenario is - they won't. There will be no value in it. The masses will be left adrift to fend for themselves.  It's up to us all to make sure that doesn't come to pass.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How can we bridge the widening global inequality gap?\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/bridge-widening-global-inequality-gap-180123085415512.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Global wealth inequality in focus at Davos summit\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/global-wealth-inequality-focus-davos-summit-180123162543275.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ The French government has announced it will implement new measures to combat gender pay gaps in the workplace.

Emotional poetry    *  In Kuwait, Farouk lived with the Iraqi poet Badr Shakir al-Sayab. Shousha described this as \\\"the most important year of his life.\\\"\\\\xa0    *  For many, Shousha's poetry is described as emotional because he often talks about love. \\\"My relationship with women starts with my mother, who encouraged me to read and write poetry \\\\u2026 A poet who lives without a woman, is a poet who is divorced from the universe. In the absence of women, there is no real life, only a desert.\\\" Shousha said in an interview.    *  The first volume of Shousha's Collected Poems was published in 1985, and the second volume in 2007. \\\"I am happy to be honoured during my lifetime, not, as is the case with so many intellectuals, long after I die,\\\" he said.    *  Farouk authored 13 poetic anthologies and won the Nile Prize for Literature in 2016.\\\\xa0    > In the absence of women, there is no real life, only a desert.\\\\r > > Farouk Shousha > >   Media critic    *  After graduation, he began working as a\\\\xa0radio presenter, and rose to director of Egyptian National Radio.    *  He later worked in TV, but left in 1977 after his \\\"Cultural Evening\\\" show was rescheduled for broadcast at 3am in the morning, instead of 8pm.

It was the beginning of the six-year-long First Intifada.  After two decades of illegal Israeli occupation in the [Gaza Strip](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/gaza.html) and West Bank, Palestinians of all generations and political parties worked together in astounding unity as one force, demanding Palestine's liberation.  With their non-violent tactics, such as protests, general strikes, and a boycott of Israeli products, the First Intifada became a model for grassroots resistance.  \\\"We were expecting that this intifada would bring a state for us Palestinians. [The movement] was that strong. It's not like these days,\\\" said Naila Ayyash, who was in her mid-20s when the intifada broke out.  \\\"At that time, political parties were very strong, especially the women's movement inside the parties.\\\"  According to Rula Salameh, who was a freshman at Ramallah's Birzeit University when the intifada began, there wasn't a single student who hadn't joined a political party on campus. All students spent their time and energy helping their community and working towards the collective mission of liberating [Palestine](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Palestine.html) from Israeli occupation.  Salameh recalled sleeping in tents for three nights in a village near Tulkarm with 150 university students; the student council arranged the trip so they could help a Palestinian family collect olives on their land.  Since an Israeli military area and a settlement were located near their land, soldiers would typically prevent the family from reaching their lands during olive harvest season, Salameh explained.  \\\"This was the first time that [the family] managed to collect all the olives without being attacked by soldiers,\\\" Salameh said.  \\\"Compared with the situation today, it's totally different. Voluntary work was really a part of our life, part of what we were educated to do. Everyone felt that they were doing something positive for their community. We weren't wasting our energy.\\\"  While the student movement served as an engine that helped propel the First Intifada, today's youth face drastically different dynamics.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/11/8571f94741514555bd9829c22c41b64f_18.jpg)  ---  Rula Salameh [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera]         **New obstacles**  Following US President [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people /donald-trump.html)'s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's [capital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-jerusalem-decision- latest-updates-171212081649751.html) in early December, both [Fatah](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/fatah.html) and Hamas called for a new intifada, but only some 3,000 protesters showed up, compared with tens of thousands of Palestinians on the streets during the First Intifada.   {articleGUID}   Omar Kiswani, president of the student council at Birzeit University, told Al Jazeera the Palestinian Authority (PA) is the biggest obstacle for politically active youth today; students are regularly arrested and imprisoned for their political affiliations on campus.  The PA, formed under the [1993 Oslo accords\\\\xa0](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/10/killed-oslo- accords-151001072411049.html)that officially ended the intifada, has long been criticised as an obstacle to Palestinian resistance because of its security collaboration, as a quisling authority, with [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html).  Kiswani was arrested as he prepared his candidacy in student elections. He spent a year in Israeli prisons for his participation in a [Hamas](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/Hamas.html)-affiliated group on campus.  \\\"They say that our work is illegal,\\\" Kiswani said. \\\"We get arrested regularly. Students from all parties get arrested, but Hamas students are arrested more. We're getting used to it.\\\"  In the past year, two presidents of the student union were arrested, as well as other members, said Kiswani.   **PA-Israeli collaboration**  Birzeit student Yahya Rabee, 21, was arrested at 2am by PA forces who raided his home. They detained him for three days before handing him over to Israeli forces. He was imprisoned in Israel for eight months, enduring physical abuse.  In his jail cell, he found seven friends from Birzeit also imprisoned for being part of the Hamas-affiliated group. All the young members of his family have been imprisoned for the same reason.  According to Birzeit's Right to Education campaign, since [Trump's Jerusalem declaration](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-defies-warnings- reckless-jerusalem-decision-171206160643273.html), there has been an increase in student arrests. Currently, there are more than 60 Birzeit students imprisoned in Israeli jails, detentions that are illegal under international law.   {articleGUID}   Since 2004, more than 800 Birzeit students have been arrested. Some have been sentenced to more than one life sentence.  \\\"Israel tries to destroy [the youth] by arresting them, imprisoning them and by attacking, especially, the student council,\\\" said Sondos Hamad, coordinator of the Right to Education campaign.  \\\"The Israeli occupation feels threatened by student leaders, by members of the student council, by those who are our hope to change the status quo.\\\"  About 40 percent of Palestine's male population has been imprisoned by Israel since 1967.  Any Palestinian who has shown strong potential as a leader has either been imprisoned or assassinated.  \\\"We believe and hope that every Palestinian in prison will be freed,\\\" Rabee said. \\\"They're the ones who are able to lead Palestinians, not the PA. Some of them are doctors, professors; they have [the capacity] to lead.\\\"  Rabee and Ayyash both pointed out the Palestinians' financial dependency on the PA as a factor for some to avoid civil disobedience.  \\\"Some people just care about their money and how they live.

This is very bad. This is Palestinian land. Why divide it like this?\\\"  Division and isolation is what Palestinians living in the besieged Gaza Strip have been struggling with for the past decade.  Besieged by Israel and [Egypt](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Egypt.html), the UN has repeatedly warned of a humanitarian crisis unfolding.  Al-Azhar University student Randa Harara, 21, often attends non-violent demonstrations, and said they do make a difference in letting the world know about the suffering in Gaza.  Last December, an Israeli sniper shot her in the thigh while she was protesting near Gaza's eastern border. Harara had just finished giving a TV interview when she was shot, standing 300 metres away from the fence. Despite her painful injury, she is adamant about rejoining the demonstrations as soon as she recovers.  \\\"This is our duty towards Jerusalem. As a Palestinian from Gaza, this is the least that I can do for my nation to fight against [oppression] \\\\u2026 As long as we're besieged, it's normal that we keep protesting against it.\\\"  However, because of Gaza's isolation, it's difficult for protests to pick up momentum, as was the case with the First Intifada. For a population of two million, the number of people who join the demonstrations every Friday is low, Harara explained.  \\\"There's a distance between us and Jerusalem. If we [weren't under siege], we could do more.  \\\"There has to be a better way to organise the movement. We have to express our anger and frustration in any way that we can, because it's a big issue. There should be more people going to the streets, attending demonstrations. It's for the Palestinian cause. If we, the youth, don't move, then who will?\\\"   **Social stigma**  Ayyash said during the First Intifada the majority of demonstrators were women. However, today, in Gaza, it is rare to see women participating in protests.

Since 2000, the country has experienced remarkable economic growth, with gross domestic product (GDP) rising from $1.7bn in 2000 to $8.4bn in 2016 and the number of students, teachers and schools rising rapidly as well.  However, Rwanda can be considered to be an outlier; today, only two percent of total global scientific research output comes from African countries.  NEF's goal is to increase that number significantly in the coming years and decades.  To do so, the organisation, which was founded in collaboration with the African Institute for Mathematics and Science (AIMS), offers fellowships for researchers, grants for promising technologies and support for local and regional projects that increase Africa's footprint in the scientific field.  This year's main topic was connecting science to humanity, and the majority of the panels and discussions focused on subjects like healthcare, the future of education and closing the gender gap.   **The agenda**  Discussions ranged from how to how to change the mindset of young children so that they aspire to become scientists, to how technologies like blockchain might improve the quality of life in [Africa](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html).  The event also saw [the launch](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03 /scientific-african-launched-increase-research-output-180327054503108.html) of Africa's first scientific journal, the Scientific African.  During the Challenge of Invention to Innovation (ci2i) competition, researchers from across Africa were invited to pitch inventions addressing health challenges and climate change.  It was during this ceremony, at the end of the three-day event, that the event's topics of health, education and the gender gap all came together.  One of the winners, Rachel Sibande from Malawi, who pitched a system that used maize husks as biofuel to generate electricity, dedicated her prize to all women in Africa.  \\\"This is for all the women and girls of Africa that are working to innovate and change the world,\\\" Sibande said.  Conrad Tankou from Cameroon developed a system using mobile phones to diagnose breast and cervical cancer for women in rural areas, to whom he dedicated his win.  > There have been revolutions around the globe, and Africa has always been left behind.

He studied philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and intended to go into law, but later his path changed.  This is his story:   Mexican Revolution\\\\xa0    *  Guillermo Haro was born on March 21, 1913. Growing up during the Mexican Revolution and concerned over his country and the changes that were taking place, he decided to study philosophy.    * However, during his time as a student, he met Luis Enrique Eroz, a Mexican astronomer and politician who encouraged him to change his path.\\\\xa0Haro started working as Eroz's assistant at the Tonantzintla Observatory.   *  Between 1943 and 1947, he went on to train at observatories in the US, including the Harvard College Observatory and the Case Institute of Technology, embarking upon a career in astronomy.    *  \\\"He was a passionate man ... and he had character and decisiveness. He went to Harvard ... and convinced the director of Harvard University,\\\" Julieta Fierro, a Mexican astronomer, explained.\\\\xa0         ---  \\\\xa0      Astronomy    *  Later, Haro returned to his natal land, and in 1945 started working in Tonantzintla again.    *  During this time, he met his wife, the pre-eminent Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska. She said she was drawn to his intellect.\\\\xa0    *  In interviews, she narrated how, in his childhood, Haro discovered, thanks to his mother, on a trip to Cuautla, that behind the mountains there were other mountains, and that behind them, others. He realised the world didn't end in those mountains. According to Poniatowska, this was fundamental in his decision to follow the path of astronomy.\\\\xa0    * \\\"Before Guillermo Haro, astronomy was in a stagnant state in Mexico,\\\" Arcadio Poveda, a Mexican astronomer told local media.\\\\xa0   > Before Guillermo Haro, astronomy was in a stagnant state in Mexico. > > Arcadio Poveda\\\\xa0 > >   Red and blue stars\\\\xa0    *  Among his biggest contributions was the discovery of a type of planetary nebulae named Herbig-Haro objects.    *  He also discovered flare stars - red and blue blight stars - in the region of the Orion constellation.\\\\xa0    * Haro listed 8,746 blue stars. In 1956, he listed 44 blue galaxies, and discovered T Tauri stars, a supernova, more than 10 novae and a comet.   *  \\\"Haro did not lower his guard, he always wanted to do more, he wanted to go further, he wanted the country to be transformed,\\\" Manuel Peimbert, one of his students, told local media.\\\\xa0    *  These contributions led to Haro becoming the first Mexican elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1959, alerting the rest of the world to the emergence of serious astronomy in Mexico.    * He was one of the founders of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and served as its first president in 1960.

Those of us who are visible as an \\\"other\\\" - having black or brown skin, bearing names that show we are Muslim or Hispanic, wearing clothing that mark us as somehow \\\"different\\\" - are repetitively evoked (in both veiled and vulgar language) in the president's public speeches, private policy meetings, and barrages of tweets.

Americans are told, since childhood, that hard work and perseverance not only build character, but allow them to overcome obstacles, and achieve their goals and dreams. Because this powerful myth is repetitively drummed into their heads - be it through apocryphal narratives of kids who came from impoverished backgrounds who went on to become multimillion-dollar earning athletes, or women who beat the odds and attained positions of leadership in fields dominated by men - they learn to believe that their country is a meritocracy.  > These experiences of failure and not-making-it are true, unexceptional, and the norm; yet, they are unincorporated into America's popular narrative.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   Anyone who has gone thorough the immigration process here knows that US immigration is not only class-based, but underhandedly racist, too: after all, Trump himself remarked, in that same infamous policy meeting, that immigrants from Asia should be favoured over those from Haiti and Africa.  So it baffles me why legislators and pundits are suddenly calling on immigration reforms to reflect the desire for skilled workers, when it is clear, from even a cursory glance at H1B and Greencard application documents, that it is already so.  As an immigrant who was born in a small island in South Asia (Sri Lanka) and grew up in a Southern African country (Zambia), and who now lives and teaches in the US, I make a point of incorporating my own narrative of immigration - the cost, the paperwork, the lawyers' fees, the networks of fellow immigrants who helped me, and the (often difficult to identify) factors and existing privileges in my personal history that allowed me to be a \\\"successful\\\" immigrant - into how I teach my global literature classes.   {articleGUID}   \\\"It's about money and existing privilege,\\\" I laugh. \\\"America sure didn't want any tired and poor immigrants.\\\" Most of my American students are surprised - unless they, too, have come from recent-immigrant families.\\\\xa0  We all know this to be true, if we are recent immigrants to the US. But we become defensive against racism, and prefer to align ourselves with American rhetoric of being exceptional. And because US immigration policy already selects immigrants who come from privileged social class, caste, and educational backgrounds, this group is used to being seen as elite; certainly, these immigrants do not want to align themselves with workers in the service industries or the undocumented.\\\\xa0  I was dismayed, but not surprised, therefore, by the defensive rhetoric used by my fellow immigrants when \\\"Shithole-gate\\\" hit the national and international fans. On Twitter and Facebook, immigrants brought out the weaponry of respectability to prove that racists were wrong about them. Since Haiti and Africa were on the \\\"shithole\\\" list this time, they listed the exceptional African and Haitian immigrants who invented amazing things and discovered incredible surgical techniques that no doubt saved the lives of countless American racists who hated immigrants.  Others touted how so few immigrants, statistically, are involved in any crimes. Articles, like this one in the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-global-african-immigrants- explainer-20180112-story.html), rushed to assure frightened Americans that while many are refugees, and \\\"beneficiaries of the 'diversity visa programme' aimed at boosting immigration from underrepresented nations\\\\u2026African immigrants **** are better educated than people born in the US or the immigrant population as a whole\\\".  The African Studies Association's Board of Directors released the following [statement](http://www.africanstudies.org/news/967-statement-by-the-asa-board- of-directors-regarding-president-trump-s-remarks):  \\\"[In the] US Census Bureau report, Africans account for only 4 percent of the total foreign-born population in the United States, but the educational attainment of that 4 percent far exceeds the average of all of those born outside of the US.\\\\xa0Indeed, 41 percent of African residents in the US hold bachelor's degrees or higher. Nigerians, who have been singled out by the president on previous occasions, are among the most educated group in the US, with some 61 percent holding bachelor's degrees and 17 percent masters degrees.\\\"  All this is true. But this rhetoric only serves to boost the myth of merit, and further the erroneous belief that only the \\\"deserving\\\" and exceptional - who are mostly exceptional because of existing class, family, political, and educational privileges - should be in the US.  As critic\\\\xa0Steven Salaita\\\\xa0explained in a Facebook post, cases like that of 57-year-old Palestinian-American business owner, [Amer Othman Adi](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/01/youngstown_businessman_facing_deportation_is_expected_to_be_released.html)\\\\xa0-\\\\xa0who has been unjustly held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is currently on hunger strike,\\\\xa0\\\"gives lie to the conservative (and often liberal) narrative that 'good' immigrants are welcome \\\\u2026 By all accounts, including those of a mayor, a business community, and a congressman, Adi was the ideal arrivant. So, even by the insidious standards of model minority discourse (fuelled by anti-Black racism and Native dispossession), Adi isn't worthy of freedom and dignity. What is left to conclude? That people from certain countries - shitholes - are never acceptable no matter how much they conform to the state's chauvinistic mythologies.\\\"  > It is time that Asian immigrants in particular ... also stop imagining themselves as more special and deserving than US minorities of non-recent immigrant backgrounds.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   In my university classes, I make sure that I stress that all but the most privileged had to almost bend God's will to be here, and stay here. I make sure that I include immigrants who are both documented and undocumented in this narrative.\\\\xa0  We are nearly all exceptional in many ways, but not because we have class privilege and exceptional jobs - but because of the inventiveness of our hustle, the \\\"I can't go on/I'll go on\\\" ideology, evocative of Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's beautiful, painful writing.  We internalise that struggle, steel, and vulnerability in the face of immigration officials at airports, border checkpoints, local immigration offices, and the everyday racism we encounter. When I read French existentialists, I actually laugh: if they actually wanted to know what it is like to face insurmountable obstacles, they should have first spoken to a black or brown immigrant in the US (or France) first.\\\\xa0  It is true that many of the first friends I made in the US were in college because they did have something exceptional about them that parents and teachers recognised; a slew of people - school administrators, guidance counsellors, a friend in the neighbourhood who had an aunt who went to college - helped get them into university by helping them fill out paperwork, write entrance essays, and generally navigate the difficult US tertiary education system and immigrate into the lower rungs of the US middle class.\\\\xa0  But I also pose this question: what happens if you are exceptional, but a queue of terrible and overworked educators dismiss or simply do not see your ability? What happens if you are not exceptional, but simply ordinary, and poor, and immigrant?  While the ordinary middle and upper-middle class kid will often have parents and educators advocating for them - protecting the young person from learning difficult lessons even at the cost of their character and skills development - the poor and the immigrant in the US rarely have the benefits of that invisible, protective shield.\\\\xa0These experiences of failure and not-making- it are true, unexceptional, and the norm; yet, they are unincorporated into the US's popular narrative.   {articleGUID}   Those who have gone through this expensive and Faustian processes of an H1-B application, Permanent Residency or \\\"Greencard\\\" process, and eventually, US citizenship, know how ludicrously and nakedly class-based, racist, and violent it is towards immigrants. It is especially so for women of colour.  This system clearly favours those with existing economic, class, gender, and privileges that pipeline them into college educations. Those of us from urban centres, rather than rural areas, from nations with thriving education systems, from families with existing wealth and political power, and those from ethnic groups that are in ascendancy get ahead.\\\\xa0  US visas and immigration processes favour those with money in hand, to pay for those exorbitant application fees, a requirement at every step of the immigration and naturalisation process. Yet, if I suggest that the US is not a meritocracy, my students react in disbelief, and many sweetly try to convince me otherwise, using the examples of the miraculous achievements of the authors we read in class.  When I point out that the problem with a meritocracy is that only those who are truly exceptional - like the authors we read - who will \\\"make it\\\" out of dire circumstances, there is silence. When I point out that none of us would have a chance, should we have been born in more dire circumstances, since no one in class (including me) is truly as exceptional as any of the authors we read, there is more silence.  These are some of the few moments in which I have felt that I have communicated something of importance about how structures in the US work - creating at least some doubt about powerful and pervasive mythologies that serve only to blame those who cannot claw their way out of circumstances meant to make them fail.   {articleGUID}   \\\\xa0The truth is, anyone who plots, schemes, saves, and works to the point of exhaustion - sometimes only with the hope that the next or even the third generation will benefit - in an economically and politically powerful nation like the US has to be exceptional, in some way.  It is obvious that (white) Americans need to be disabused of the notion that the US's white population is special, and deserving, somehow, of privilege; it is time to get over the belief that they only received their privileges from having worked for it.  But just as importantly, those immigrants of more privileged backgrounds - those who are currently touting the percentage of people from their national group who have college and post-graduate degrees, as if waving these statistics and their material possessions are ways of proving that they are not, in fact, deserving of Trump's racism - also need an antidote for their misplaced smugness.  It is time that Asian immigrants in particular - who benefit from the Civil Rights Movement and the efforts of African Americans towards changing and challenging racist immigration laws that excluded Asians, and who have, as a group, been favoured since American immigration began moving towards a merit- based system - also stop imagining themselves as more special and deserving than US minorities of non-recent immigrant backgrounds.\\\\xa0  Our class snobbery, carried over from our old countries, and defensive superiority, developed against the racism of our new country, has only aided white supremacists who couldn't care less about how exceptional we are.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"The very American myth of 'exceptional immigrants'\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/american-myth-exceptional-immigrants-180119124728058.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ In [Kenya](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kenya.html), teachers are getting a new curriculum for the first time in 32 years.

A statement from his family on Sunday said: \\\"Sir Roger Bannister died peacefully in Oxford on 3 March, aged 88, surrounded by his family who were as loved by him, as he was loved by them.  \\\"He banked his treasure in the hearts of his friends.\\\"  British Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/theresa.html) led the tributes to the former athlete, who later became one of [Europe](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html) 9s leading neurologists and was made a knight.  \\\"Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed,\\\" she said on Twitter.  The record-breaking run was on the Oxford University track during a local athletics meeting, with only a few spectators witnessing the Englishman 9s destruction of the myth that no human being could run so fast.  Bannister made headlines around the world at the age of 25. His achievement opened the physical and psychological door for many other milers, who have since beaten his time of three minutes 59.4 seconds.  Roger Gilbert Bannister, born in Harrow, a London suburb, on March 23, 1929, was a shy, gangling medical student who preferred to be an oarsman rather than a runner.  In 1946, when he went to Oxford, his great ambition was to row against Cambridge in the annual boat race on the Thames.  But Bannister, who stood 1.8 meters tall and weighed only 68 kilograms, was told he was too light to make a first-rate oarsman.  So he turned to running and his new ambition became to win the 1,500 meters at the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952.  Bannister started a five-year build-up, and, in 1947, at the age of 17, ran his first mile race at Oxford, finishing second in a time of just over five minutes. Later that year, he won the mile for Oxford against Cambridge in an athletics meeting.  >  > > All at British Athletics are incredibly saddened by the passing of Sir Roger Bannister at the age of 88.  >  > A legend in every sense of the word.

But he managed only fourth place in the Helsinki Games 1,500 meters final.  The press criticized him for faulty training methods. Bannister, nicknamed the \\\"lone wolf miler\\\" because he scorned coaches, had worked out his own training schedule to fit in with his studies.  After Helsinki, he became the forgotten man of athletics. But he had set his sights on the four-minute-mile - a challenge which had fascinated athletes and enthusiasts for years.  The world record was gradually being whittled down and a number of athletes were considered capable of crashing the four-minute barrier.  Australia 9s great miler, John Landy, recorded a four minutes 2.1 seconds mile in December 1952, and Bannister cut this to four minutes two seconds in June 1953.  With American Wes Santee trying to lower his [US](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html) record of four minutes 2.4 seconds, the pressure was on and four-minute-mile fever was mounting. To Bannister, the challenge was not only to break the barrier but to be the first man to do so.  The Oxford University versus Amateur Athletics Association fixture of May 6 was the first competition of the British season of 1954. Bannister, by then a medical student at a London hospital, set that day for his attempt.  He enlisted the aid of his training companions and friends, Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher, top athletes in their own right, as pacemakers.   Setting the record  May 6 was cold, wet and windy - not ideal for a record-breaking attempt. Bannister thought of calling it off, but, after a short rain shower and with a drop in the wind, he said: \\\"Right, I 9ll try.\\\"  After a false start by pacemaker Brasher, the field of six got away. Bannister urged Brasher to go faster and at the halfway mark called on Chataway to take over from the tiring Brasher.  Then, 210 meters from the tape, he pulled out from behind Chataway to immortalize himself as the first sub-four-minute miler.  Seven weeks later, Landy beat Bannister 9s record, with a mile in three minutes 57.9 seconds, and, in August, Bannister lowered his own time to three minutes 58.8 seconds, beating Landy at the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, [Canada](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Canada.html).   Medical career  In August 1954, Bannister captured the European 1500 meters crown. Having qualified as a doctor, he retired from active athletics at the end of 1954 to pursue his medical career.  By 1963, he was established in his profession as a consultant in nervous diseases at three hospitals, and, a year later, he became a member of Britain 9s Advisory Sports Council.  In 1971, aged 42 and a father of four, he was appointed by the government as the first chairman of the Executive Sports Council designed to finance and promote British sport.  He was awarded a knighthood in 1975. He became president of the World Sports Council in 1976 and in 1977 was the first Briton to win West Germany 9s Hans-Heinrich Siegbert prize for his services to sport.  Oxford University elected him Master (head) of its Pembroke College in 1985.  Bannister gave up his medical practice after a serious car accident and devoted himself to research. He became director of the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London and edited a textbook on nervous system disorders.  His prediction that the mile record would be progressively lowered was born out in subsequent years. In 1999, Moroccan Hiram El Guerrouj became the 13th record holder since Bannister, lowering the time to 3:43.13.   Bannister quotes  On the allure of the four-minute mile:  \\\"It was a target. University athletes had been trying for years and it just didn 9t seem to be capable of being broken. There was a magic about four symmetrical laps of one minute each. It was just something that caught the public 9s imagination.  \\\"Even then people were talking about whether it would ever be possible for someone to run a mile in four minutes ... There was no logic in my mind that if you can run a mile in four minutes, 1.25, you can 9t run it in 3:59 ... I knew enough medicine and physiology to know it wasn 9t a physical barrier, but I think it had become a psychological barrier.\\\"  On his drive to be the first to break the four-minute barrier:  \\\"It stood there as something that was waiting to be done, and I was in the right place at the right time and was ready to do it. My attitude was that it can be done, and it will be done soon, and I 9d rather it were done here.  \\\"I thought it would be right for Britain to try to get this. There was a feeling of patriotism. Our new queen had been crowned the year before, Everest had been climbed in 1953. Although I tried in 1953, I broke the British record, but not the four-minute mile, and so everything was ready in 1954.\\\"  On the bad weather on the day of his attempt and his uncertainty over whether to run:  \\\"I was using a flag on a neighboring church, a St. George 9s flag. I noticed it fluttering and I used that as a measure of the strength of the wind. And I felt that just 20 minutes before, it was not fluttering as strongly. ... I calculated there 9s a 50-50 chance of my doing it. I said, 8If there 9s a 50-50 chance and I don 9t take it, I may never get another chance to beat (John) Landy to it. 9 So I said, 8Let 9s do it. 9\\\"  On the size of the crowd at Oxford 9s Iffley Road track on the day of his run:  \\\"If the number of people who have come up to me saying they were there, they would have fit into Wembley Stadium. Matter of fact, there weren 9t more than 1,500. I hadn 9t advertised the fact. Word got out that I might break the four-minute mile, but I didn 9t want to be rail-roaded to being committed to running it if the conditions were absolutely hopeless.\\\"  On the race:  \\\"Chris Brasher was leading. He was a steeplechaser. I settled back. First lap, 58 seconds, and then as one hoped, he took us through the half-mile in 1:58. Then during the lap in which Chris Chataway took over, inevitably he was tiring. Three quarters, I heard was three minutes, 1 second. I knew I had to do the last lap in 59. At 300 meters, I overtook him. I then went flat out for the finishing line and just about managed to stagger over it, all in. I couldn 9t stand at the end. I had always been able to take more out of myself than there was in the final sprint and I did on that occasion.\\\"  On the announcement of his time by Norris McWhirter:  \\\"He had carefully rehearsed. He announced: 8The result of event No. 8, one mile, was R.G. Bannister, of Merton and Exeter Colleges, in a time which subject to ratification, is a new track record, a new British all-comers record, a new European record, a new Commonwealth Empire record, a new world record in three ... 9 That was when the crowd exploded and we didn 9t hear any more. It didn 9t matter what the rest was.\\\"  On his showdown against John Landy at the Empire Games in Vancouver, British Columbia:  \\\"I knew that more important than the four-minute mile, from the point of view of my career, was whether I could or could not defeat John Landy. The Empire Games in Vancouver were the important settling of the score. If I didn 9t manage to defeat John Landy there, he would be the world record holder and have the right to be the best miler in the world.\\\"  \\\"He went into the lead. The first half-mile was just on two minutes. At three- quarters he seemed to be getting away from me and there was a gap of about 12 yards at one point. But I managed to close the gap during the third lap, and then on the last bend he looked over his left shoulder and I chose that moment to overtake him and we managed to finish in that order: Bannister one and Landy two, by about four yards.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Roger Bannister dies, the 'lone wolf miler'\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/roger-bannister-dies-lone-wolf-miler-180304180538260.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 in part for \\\"striving\\\" to attain \\\"ethnic conciliation by peaceful means\\\".

She describes every little detail about this place - the water spring, the lavish trees and the flowers that bloom throughout the year. She tells us about the beautiful old stone houses, the fig trees and the cactus plants.  Imwas is a village situated southeast of the town of Ramleh, where my grandfather owned a plot of land. After my grandfather passed, my father inherited the land. One day, my nine siblings and I will inherit this land from our father. We'll build our home there, and we'll harvest the crops of our field.  But for now, we live in a small apartment in the Qalandia refugee camp, east of [Jerusalem](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/jerusalem.html). My family has lived there since the Israeli army forced my grandfather from his land in Imwas in 1967. We live in the overcrowded camp, thinking that this is temporary, like the rest of the camp's residents, many of whom were forced from their lands in 1948, when Israel was created.  We keep telling ourselves that this is all temporary, and we believe it. The faith we inherited from our ancestors is strong and deep - we believe that it is possible for us to return to our lands. In fact, we believe that our return will come soon. After all, it is a basic human right. We cling on to this belief today and we will pass it on to our children and our grandchildren.  Mr President,\\\\xa0I turned 20 a few months ago, but until now, I have never set foot in Imwas, the village I come from. I've only heard about it from my grandmother. I recently searched it on Google and found out that Israel built a large garden there. Of course, this garden is for Israelis only. They can walk and hike there, while we, the people of Imwas, are forbidden from visiting our village.  To add to the pain of losing our home and the ongoing difficulties we face in the camp, we recently heard that the United States has decided to [reduce aid](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/cuts-unrwa- funding-180116193513823.html) to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\\\\xa0  UNRWA was established 69 years ago to help refugee families like mine until they are able to return home. A reduction in this agency's funding will be a disaster for us because we are still not allowed to return home. If you do not reverse this decision, this will be the first step in ending the discussion on our future. It will make these \\\"temporary\\\" camps, where we have been waiting for decades, into permanent ones.  We heavily depend on UNRWA's services for our education and healthcare. The school that my younger siblings attend is now under threat of closing down. If this happens, they won't have a place to complete their basic education.  I completed my primary and middle school education at UNRWA schools inside the Qalandia refugee camp. I attended a secondary school in Ramallah, as there was not an UNRWA secondary school in the camp that could accommodate me. Now, I am studying journalism at Birzeit University, West Bank.  I want my younger siblings to also receive an education, but I now fear that there will be no schools for them to attend. I am not the only one worried about this - every parent in the camp is worried about their children's future.  The residents of the camp live in very difficult financial conditions. Most of those who work earn no more meagre salaries. If UNRWA schools close down, many families would not be able to find alternative schools to educate their children because the would not be able to afford transportation costs and private school fees.  The issue does not stop at education. The US decision will also impact UNRWA's health clinics. In Qalandia refugee camp, we only have one medical centre. This medical centre is the only place our children can receive medical care and vaccinations. The closure of this centre, or even a reduction in its services, will have serious repercussions for us. The children will not receive vaccinations, the elderly and the sick will not receive the necessary medical care; we will be facing yet another humanitarian crisis.  I am particularly fearful about my younger brother, Zain. He is not even one year old and like any other baby, he needs several vaccinations. I fear that he will not be able to get them if the centre closes down. I also fear for the brother still inside my mother's womb. I constantly ask myself: Will we be able to vaccinate him? Will we be able to find treatment for my younger siblings if they fall sick one day?  These questions keep me and my mother awake at night.\\\\xa0  In addition to healthcare and education, UNRWA also provides food to many financially disadvantaged families in Qalandia refugee camp. These families may not have food on the table tomorrow if UNRWA's services are cut.\\\\xa0  Most of the poor families who depend on food aid from UNRWA are missing a father and a breadwinner. Their children may go hungry if UNRWA is gone.  Mr President, if the US goes forward with its decision to reduce aid to UNRWA, refugees like me and my family, who had already been forced from their lands and homes, will face a new humanitarian disaster, especially the poorer and more vulnerable families. In the long term, this move will give [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html) green light to continue violating our rights.\\\\xa0  Mr President, will you go back on this decision before it's too late?\\\\xa0   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Dear Mr Trump, we're facing a humanitarian disaster\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/dear-trump-facing-humanitarian-disaster-180131094246849.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ YouTube has deleted the account of Atomwaffen Division, an [American neo-Nazi group](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/06/magazine- documenting-america-white-nationalists-150609095548558.html) that was thrust into the spotlight after several media reports linked it to a spate of murders.  \\\"This account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech,\\\" a banner read on the group's YouTube channel as of Wednesday.

During that run, the 17-year-old Kim got a lot more cheers from the audience than most US athletes because she is ethnically Korean, having been born in the US to parents who migrated from South Korea.  Kim's success has sparked a conversation in South Korea over whether she would have risen to the top had she been born and raised in Korea.  Some suggested that had that happened, she would have spent her youth studying all day instead of developing her creative snowboard style.  South Korea has not produced any star athletes in snow sports but it has put up significant Winter Olympics achievements in a short time. No athlete from the country had won a Winter Olympics medal until 1992, when the country came away with four.  That number rose to 14, the country's best-ever performance, at the 2010 Vancouver Games.  Winter sports is just one area in which South Korea has come a long way in a short time, having risen from post-war poverty in the 1950s to becoming one of the world's richest countries in a matter of decades.  To fuel this rise, South Koreans work longer hours than most of their counterparts in other developed countries, sleep less and take shorter vacations.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/11/b04e2c5ec2e649418ef4d79cd0e47c03_18.jpg)  ---   However, it also leaves some of them ill-prepared for what to do with the rest of their lives when their sports dreams fizzle [Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters]      The athletes apply this kind of vigor to training, dedicating themselves to their sport from a young age, while foregoing other aspects of youth, such as socialising, hobbies, even their studies.  South Korea's ice dancer at Pyeongchang 2018 Yura Min grew up in the US but said her family was \\\"culturally very Korean\\\" and, as a child, Korean was her first language and her parents inculcated strict work habits in her from a young age.  She started skating aged six and remembers waking up at 4:30am for practice followed by a full day at school.  After school, she would go for violin, taekwondo and ballet classes in the evenings. As her talent for skating became clear, she gave up those other activities and her life began to revolve around time on the ice.  \\\"My mom would follow me to my training, and my dad would work,\\\" said Min.  \\\"I only remember a handful of times where we all sat down and had dinner. I wish we could all sit around and talk about our days, but we all had other things to do.\\\"   Physically taxing  Analysts believe junior South Korean athletes are asked to sacrifice too much, that their training regimes are physically taxing and rob them of the chance to enjoy normal, balanced youths.  \\\"Unlike other countries, in South Korea there aren't child athletes who compete just for the fun of it. Once South Korean kids start training, they have to give up on their studies and focus all of their time, from morning till night, on training,\\\" Chung Hee-joon, professor of sports science at Dong-A University, told Al Jazeera.  South Korea's job market, too, is challenging at the best of times. Thousands of university graduates are competing for a limited number of stable and well- paid jobs at large companies.  Former athletes can find it difficult to get hired - during their youth, they did not have the time to develop the kinds of skills employers look for.  A 2013 study of 3,000 former athletes by the Korea Institute of Sports Science found that roughly a third of the athletes they surveyed ended up unemployed.  \\\"It is very difficult for athletes to get jobs other than through their parents' connections, or taking on a family business,\\\" Chung added.  \\\"Nowadays, athletes tend to mostly come from wealthy families who can afford the costs of training and the risks involved.\\\"\\\\xa0  But things are gradually improving. The government appears to be taking notice of the challenges faced by retiring athletes, and is allocating resources to helping them prepare for their futures.  > Nowadays, athletes tend to mostly come from wealthy families who can afford the costs of training and the risks involved.\\\\r > > Chung Hee-joon, professor of sports science at Dong-A University > >   Park Seong-hee, a professor of sports management at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, has, for nearly a decade, worked on a South Korean government programme that counsels and assists post-career athletes.  He said more South Korean athletes are making that transition successfully now.  \\\"The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism has reformed the sports system from the grassroots level and tried to build a sound 'sports development system,'\\\" Park said.  \\\"The government is also developing many after-career programmes for athletes, such as English education, sports industry education, retirement programmes, and graduate school scholarships.  \\\"Many athletes see the end of their careers as a death sentence. They often don't have the confidence to move forward because all they have done in their lives to that point is play sports.\\\"  Min graduated high school but decided to forego university to focus on skating.  At age 22, she still has several years of competition ahead of her, and plans to compete in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.  Once she hangs up her skates, she hopes to make her career either as a coach or in another role in South Korea's ice skating federation.  \\\"Korea doesn't yet have the infrastructure of coaching and training that is needed for ice dancing, and I'd like to help establish that,\\\" she said.  South Koreans hope that in four years time, they will have a breakout athlete of their own.   Too young to compete  Many are pinning hopes on figure skating prodigy You Young who, at 13 years of age, is too young to compete in this year's event.  She has been famous in South Korea since she caught the eyes of the masses in 2016, when, aged just 11, she became the youngest national champion in the country's history.  You wowed the audience with her ability to pull off tricks that befuddle skaters who are older and physically more mature than her. Many hope she can follow in the footsteps of South Korea's Kim Yuna, who won figure skating gold at the 2010 Winter Olympics.  But reaching this level of excellence is not by accident.  You adheres to a demanding schedule that has her training for several hours daily and eschewing the time for hobbies and friends that most 11-year-olds partake in.

[The Global Gender Gap Report](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2017.pdf) uses markers such as economic opportunity, political empowerment, and health and survival to gauge the state of gender equality in a country.  Since the reports began in 2006, Iceland has closed around 10 percent of its total gender gap, making it one of the fastest-improving countries in the world.  The new legislation was supported by Iceland's centre-right government, as well as the opposition, in a parliament where nearly 50 percent of all members are women.  \\\"I think that now people are starting to realise that this is a systematic problem that we have to tackle with new methods,\\\" said Aradottir Pind.  \\\"Women have been talking about this for decades and I really feel that we have managed to raise awareness, and we have managed to get to the point that people realise that the legislation we have had in place is not working, and we need to do something more,\\\" she added.

He will be blamed for taking a once prestigious liberation party to the edge of disrepair. But it is the acute sense of betrayal of common South Africans that is most likely to resonate most.  Zuma became president of [South Africa](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-africa.html) in 2009 under the most casuistic of circumstances.   Populist lies  Having been [fired](http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/president-thabo- mbeki-sacks-deputy-president-jacob-zuma) as deputy president by former president Thabo Mbeki in 2005 over a corruption scandal, Zuma managed to dress himself up as a victim of a witch-hunt.  Two years later, he won the ANC leadership, dragging trade unions and the working class into a spire of populist lies in which he claimed to represent their interests. He subsequently became president of the country when the ANC won the 2009 national elections.  Under his watch, South Africa struggled to create jobs and meet its growth targets.  According to Phumlani Majozi, non-executive director at the Free Market Foundation based in Johannesburg, unemployment[ rose](https://africacheck.org/reports/anc-job-creation-boast-ignores-sas- increased-unemployment-rate/%20) from 22-28 percent under his watch.  \\\"The country descended to junk status and national debt has risen under him,\\\" Majozi told Al Jazeera.  Analysts say as Zuma became increasingly embroiled in one corruption scandal after another, he set about interfering with state institutions, placing\\\\xa0loyalists in key positions as he looked to build an impenetrable empire.  \\\"His departure will be his main legacy. It will set an important limit on the undue exercise of presidential power,\\\" Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, activist and author of Democracy and Delusion, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"South Africa will look back and wonder how we allowed a president so reprehensible to last so long in office,\\\" Mpofu-Walsh said.  Ayesha Omar, a lecturer in political science at Wits University, said Zuma possibly \\\"brought the ANC to its lowest point since its inception\\\".   But for others, such as Steven Friedman, director for the Study of Democracy at the University of Johannesburg, Zuma was always merely a symptom of a larger malaise in the ANC and government.  \\\"The system rewards patronage. This is why people join politics in this country. They know that if you get an 'in' into the system, you will make it.  \\\"This culture did not start with Zuma,\\\" Friedman told Al Jazeera.   Rising inequality  It is a view shared by 26-year-old student activist Wandile Gewu, who says state corruption has always been widespread. The focus on Zuma, he said, is exaggerated and part of an attempt to derail a larger Zuma project known as radical economic transformation.  According to [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/bp- reward-work-not-wealth-220118-summ-en.pdf%20), the top 10 percent of South African society earns half of all wages, whereas the bottom 50 percent of the country's workforce receives just 12 percent of all wages.  When broken down by race, Stats South Africa says white people earn[ five times more](https://businesstech.co.za/news/wealth/153485/whites-earn-5-times- more-than-blacks-in-south-africa-stats-sa/) than black people in the country.\\\\xa0Zuma supporters say it was the former president who introduced free tertiary education for the poor and looked to end the privilege of what is known in South Africa as white monopoly capital.  \\\"He is the only president in the history of the ANC who had the courage to fight it head-on,\\\" Gewu said.  Mpendulo Khwela, 27, also a student based in Durban, told Al Jazeera it was Zuma who brought South Africa into BRICS, a group of five emerging economies, \\\"that looks to boost and sustain the country's economy\\\".  But analysts say Zuma achieved little other than lining his own pockets.  \\\"Look, I'd say that the Zuma administration was aggressive when it came to tackling the HIV pandemic and scaling up the ARV [drug] treatment programme. But other than that, it's hard to point out any positives from his presidency,\\\" said Majozi from the Free Market Foundation.  The move to make higher education free for working class and poor students is seen by many as untenable and merely populist attempts to hold on to power. \\\"Even if free education is ideal, it's unclear how we can afford it in our current circumstances,\\\" Majozi said.  The burning question of land redistribution, considered among the most pressing issues of post-apartheid South Africa, was routinely put off and slow under Zuma's watch. It was only in 2017 that he began pushing for land expropriation without compensation.   Fraught legacy  Omar said Zuma's legacy will be \\\"characterised by populist opportunism, corruption, state capture and an utter disregard for constitutionalism\\\".  \\\"The country has found itself in a dire economic situation with staggeringly high rates of unemployment because of reckless leadership,\\\" said Omar.  Friedman emphasised that \\\"Zuma tried to make the state his private property\\\".  In 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled Zuma had \\\"failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution\\\" when he refused to pay heed to the public prosecutor's findings that he had to pay back a portion of state funds used to upgrade his rural home in Nkandla.  The opposition began impeachment proceedings in parliament, but this failed, too, when the ANC majority in parliament voted against the move. In December 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that parliament had violated the Constitution, too. This ruling, and the election of [Cyril Ramaphosa](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/cyril-ramaphosa-anc- leader-171218180222503.html) as the new leader of the ANC, set into motion the move to pressure Zuma to step down  \\\"Whatever happens, no one is going to say, 'Oh, I wish Zuma was here,'\\\" Friedman said.  Mthembu, still sitting on the bench, said he will have to come back in a few days to deliver more CVs to potential employers. He said the system is unfair and wonders if Zuma will face prosecution in the days to come.  \\\"If I commit a crime, I won't find a job. I will be marked as 'dirty'. How is it that the president can steal, be a criminal and continue to lead a nation?'\\\" he said.  \\\"You want to know how I will remember Zuma? Well, I guess he could dance.

Last year, Rakhine State made headlines around the world because of a military crackdown, which forced more than 600,000 [Rohingya ](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/rohingya.html)into neighbouring [Bangladesh](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bangladesh.html). The Rakhine consider the Rohingya outsiders from Bangladesh, and in some cases, have participated in the violence against them.  What is less known is that the Rakhine people also have a history of being oppressed - by the Burmese military, which enforced a rule of 'Burmanisation' or forcing the culture of the Burmese people on the country's various ethnic groups, many of whom have been at war with the central government since Myanmar's independence from the British.   Policy of 'Burmanisation'  Kyaw Hla Maung wants to revive the teaching of the state's history and study of the Rakhine language.  The 64-year-old believes that learning about the history of different ethnic and religious groups in the state is important to rebuilding peace, especially with the Rohingya.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/3/26/43a68ee09e4343d3867ddc639534a256_18.jpg)  ---   Kyaw Hla Maung believes that learning about the history of different ethnic and religious groups in the state is important to rebuild peace, especially with the Rohingya [Libby Hogan/Al Jazeera]      Kyaw Hla Maung, 64, looks more like a rock star than a historian. Dressed in a navy fitted top and flared pants, he now works as a tour guide trainer in Mrauk U, the ancient seat of the Rakhine kingdom.  While the Rakhine language is now openly used and widely spoken, teachers usually volunteer to teach language classes after hours in schools. Government schools and colleges still only allow the Burmese language to be taught.       ---  \\\\xa0     Under the military rule, a policy of \\\"Burmanisation\\\" resulted in the adoption of Burmese as the official language and schools across the country were forced to implement it. Ethnic language teaching was banned in public schools for four decades.  Kyaw Hla Maung said he was taught Rakhine language and history by his father, grandfather and local historian, Oo Tha Htun, whom he proudly calls his 'grand master'.  \\\"I did my learning deep in the forest because if soldiers or police came, there was lots of problems for us,\\\" he said.  In the jungle, not far from the ruins of Mrauk U, they taught him how to read stone inscriptions telling the history of the different periods of Rakhine history - Dhanyawadi, Vesali, Le Mro and Mrauk U - as well as traditional songs such as \\\"Buddha pujarniya\\\", about previous reigning kings.  The lessons came to an abrupt halt when Oo Tha Htun was arrested in 1990 and later died in prison in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine. Kyaw Hla Maung believes his teacher was arrested for a speech he made about Rakhine oppression under the Burmese government.   Brahmi script  After Oo Tha Htun's death, Kyaw Hla Maung, afraid of forgetting his grandfather's teachings, tattooed the Brahmi script on his arms.  The script is key to reading the stone inscriptions around the Mrauk U archaeological zone as it was used by the first of the four [dynastic eras](https://archive.org/details/PAMELAGUTMANBURMASLOSTKINGDOMSSPLENDOURSBookZa.org) of Rakhine State, the Dhanyawadi dynasty, around the mid 4th-century.  The Mrauk U kingdom was known as the golden age of Rakhine. It was a thriving multi-ethnic and multi-faith court that ruled over Rakhine from the 14th to the 18th century. The capital, Mrauk U, was once an important trading hub frequented by Portuguese, Dutch, Armenian, Arab and Persian traders.   {articleGUID}   From across the sea, the influence of Bengal also resulted in a distinct Muslim influence in Buddhist architecture, and Mrauk U rulers minted coins in both Arabic and Arakanese.  The people of Rakhine enjoyed prosperity up until the late 18th century when the Mrauk U empire was annexed by the Burmese Konbaung Dynasty, and many Rakhine people were taken prisoner.  The British arrived in Burma in the 19th century, bringing with them tens of thousands of migrant labourers from Bengal to work in paddy fields, creating tension with the local population in the Rakhine state. Historians, however, say the Rohingya's history goes as far back as the eighth century.  Mrauk U has remained a relatively peaceful city compared with the rest of Rakhine State with majority Buddhists co-existing with people from other faiths and ethnicities.  Apart from the Rakhine and Rohingya, Mro, Chin, Dynet and Thet ethnic minorities have lived in Rakhine State for centuries.  In today's Myanmar, Rakhine State is one of the poorest regions in the country, riven by ethnic tensions and several conflicts, including one by the Arakan Army, a Rakhine armed group at war with the military for \\\"self- determination of the multi-ethnic Arakanese population\\\".

Kyaw Hla Maung is sad to see his state mired in such a brutal conflict.  \\\"I do accept the Rohingya as human beings who deserve to live peacefully in Myanmar because they have been living together with Myanmar nationalities peacefully for a long time,\\\" he said.  \\\"I am sorry to see this [violence against the Rohingya]...this is the doing of the Burma security forces, who won't let peace return in Rakhine State,\\\" he said, noting the army continues to suppress Rakhine residents as well.

Kyaw Hla Maung believes that recent bloody attack is an assault on Rakhine culture and history. He says that the Rakhine ethnic people can't speak freely about their culture, history and issues that Rakhine people face.  \\\"We need to rediscover our history,\\\" he said.

Students must also not read scriptures in classes or in religious buildings, the bureau said, adding that all students and teachers should heed the notice and work to strengthen political ideology and propaganda. China is an atheist, communist state.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the notice.  The Linxia education bureau has declined to comment on the document's validity.  Xi Wuyi, a Marxist scholar at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and an outspoken critic of rising Islamic influence in China, shared the picture and welcomed the apparent move by the authorities.  With the notice, the county was taking concrete action to keep religion and education separate, and sticking strictly to education law, she said on the Weibo social media platform.  New regulations on religious affairs released in October last year, and due to take effect in February, aim to increase oversight of religious education and limit religious activities.  Last summer, a Sunday School ban was introduced in the southeastern city of Wenzhou, sometimes known as \\\"China's Jerusalem\\\" due to its large Christian population, but Christian parents found ways to teach their children about their religion, regardless.  Chinese law formally grants religious freedom for all, but regulations on education and protection of minors also say religion cannot be used to hinder state education, or children taught to believe in a religion, rather than communism.  Authorities in troubled parts of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslim minority, ban children from attending religious events.  But religious communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions.  Fear of Muslim influence has grown in China in recent years, sparked in part by violence in Xinjiang.

Investigators have made progress in probing the knife attack in which Iqbal sustained injuries to his head, back and left hand.

He comes from a family of writers. His elder brother, late Humayun Ahmed, is the most popular and highest-selling Bangladeshi writer of all time. His younger brother Ahsan Habib is a satire writer and the editor of Bangladesh's only monthly satire magazine, Unmad, which means\\\\xa0\\\"madman\\\".  After his PhD from the University of Washington, he went on to work as a scientist at the renowned Bell Laboratory in California.  In the early 2000s, he came back to Bangladesh to join Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in the northeastern Sylhet district as a professor of electrical and electronics engineering.  \\\"Zafar Iqbal left a high-salaried job at a very prestigious research lab in the US and got back to his homeland to work for it,\\\" said Mohammad Kaykobad, a friend of Iqbal.  Kaykobad, a professor of computer science and engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (BUET), has co-authored several popular science books with Iqbal.  As advocates of popularising science education, both Iqbal and Kaykobad helped launch the national level Mathematics Olympiad and Computer Programming contest in the South Asian country of 150 million.  \\\"Prof Iqbal has contributed a lot to the education sector of Bangladesh. He genuinely cares and has tremendous belief in the talent and power of Bangladeshi people,\\\" Kaykobad told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Many of us don't talk \\\\u2026 as we fear repercussions. But he didn't,\\\" said the BUET Professor, alluding to Iqbal's outspoken nature.   Why was he attacked?  Since Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League party became prime minister in 2009, Iqbal has been an active advocate of the War Crime Tribunal, which was set up to punish those accused of committing atrocities during the 1971 liberation war from Pakistan.  The Tribunal has handed out capital punishments to a number of senior leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami - the largest Islamist party - and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.  The Jamaat, which has since been banned from contesting elections, has accused the Hasina government of politicising the Tribunal, while the International Commission of Jurists has stated that the tribunal does \\\"not adhere to international standards of a fair trial and due process\\\".\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   The author became a household name through his books that included science fiction, children's stories, and other fiction and non-fiction, but in recent years he has received criticism, particularly on social media, for his stand against Islamist politics.  Bangladeshi political analyst Zia Hassan says he \\\"personally in many ways opposes the rhetoric of Professor Iqbal, which looks at the country through the simplistic narrative of pro versus against Liberation War\\\".  This perspective has now been used as a shield to protect the incumbent government's numerous misdeeds, Hassan said, adding that he, however, would like to condemn the attack on him [Iqbal] \\\"strongly\\\".  Hassan said a lot of people have genuine concerns about the state of the nation and how the ruling party has suppressed dissent.  \\\"Since [Zafar] Iqbal is sympathetic with the ruling party and blind to its misdeeds, he has now become a foremost target and there has been a concerted effort to vilify him for the things he is not responsible for.\\\"  Every person is entitled to have his political view and \\\"those who oppose Iqbal can oppose him through debates - which we have done. The government must take efforts to protect him\\\", Hassan said.  The Bangladeshi author's perception as \\\"anti-Islamist\\\" is also due to his writings, says Asif Shibgat Bhuiyah, a popular Bangladeshi blogger known for his advocacy on Islamic scholarship.  \\\"A lot of Iqbal's writings, especially the ones written for children, are of propagandist nature,\\\" Bhuiyah told Al Jazeera.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   In many of his books, a bearded or pious man is ultimately represented as a bad person or a villain, he said.

The Anglophones [claimed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/cameroon- teachers-lawyers-strike-english-161205095929616.html) they face discrimination and that they were excluded from state jobs as a result of their limited French language skills.   {articleGUID}   \\\"The Anglophone regions feel neglected and left out of the national government's agenda,\\\" Peter Micek of digital rights organisation Access Now told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Then, the government took the extreme measure to shut down the internet completely,\\\" he said.  The first shutdown lasted 93 days, from January to April 2017.  \\\"It was devastating. People didn 9t know how to work around it,\\\" Judith Nwana said, adding that the whole society was affected; education, money transfers, healthcare and businesses all relied on internet access, which was now shutdown.  Eventually, internet access was restored in April after international pressure from, among others, the United Nations and Pope Francis.  However, in October a second, more targeted shutdown was enacted after renewed protests in the Anglophone areas.  The new blockade took aim at social media and messaging apps. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp were all shut down.  But by this time, many Cameroonians were prepared, using VPN services to circumvent the blockade.  \\\"Unfortunately, VPNs are expensive and not everyone can afford one or had budgeted for one. Regardless, businesses, the tech industry, healthcare and education are seriously affected,\\\" Nwana said.  One of those affected businesses belongs to Mambe Churchill Nanje, a software engineer and CEO and founder of Njorku, a search engine that allows people all over Africa to look for jobs.  Nanje is based in Silicon Mountain, a tech-hub based and around in the city of Buea, which was hit hard by both shutdowns.  \\\"They not only affected me and my business, but the whole of Silicon Mountain,\\\" Nanje told Al Jazeera.  \\\"It has pushed out a lot of the talent [at Silicon Mountain]. They had to leave because they can't work. They either moved to other parts of Cameroon or out of the country,\\\" he said.   Internet refugee camp  As the shutdowns continued, many Cameroonians were forced to travel back and forth to regions with internet access to conduct business or access vital information.  \\\"They came together and formed an internet refugee camp along the border with the littoral region, where others could come and get internet access from the neighbouring region,\\\" Nwana said.  The first shutdown alone cost the country at least $38m, Nwana added. The effects of the second blockade are not as severe economically, but Nwana emphasised there is more than just monetary loss.  \\\"Shutting down social media sites is akin to shutting down the internet. It's how people communicate today. Cases have been recorded of people missing deadlines or scholarships and opportunities when the information is put on social media,\\\" she said.  \\\"Those in Anglophone Cameroon don 9t get to see this, which reinforces the feeling of marginalisation and discrimination,\\\" Nwana added.   {articleGUID}   Micek echoed Nwana's sentiment, saying the economic effect is big but also not the only thing that is lost because of these shutdowns.  \\\"The Silicon Mountain region is a hub of innovation and that has suffered enormously. Besides, the economy is integrated, so getting services from the Silicon Mountain area is gonna be hard, wherever people are in the country, either in the Anglophone or Francophone regions,\\\" Micek said.  \\\"And this blockade prevents not just Cameroonians but all of us from accessing businesses, personal stories and other rich content from these areas in Cameroon,\\\" Micek said.  \\\"The whole world suffers because of these shutdowns.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Cameroon internet shutdowns cost Anglophones millions\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/cameroon-internet-shutdowns-cost-anglophones-millions-180123202824701.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ A woman from [Pakistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Pakistan.html)'s marginalised community, at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy and a minority in a Muslim-majority country, has been elected to the Senate for the first time ever.

Pakistani Hindu  Kholi, who was born and raised in a remote district, attributed her success to her parents, who encouraged her to pursue her education and eventually helped her earn a university degree.  She later worked for a non-governmental organization before joining the Pakistan People's Party of the assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  The party nominated her for a seat reserved for minority candidates from the Sindh province, where it holds a majority.  \\\"I will continue to work for the rights of the oppressed people, especially for the empowerment of women, their health and education,\\\" she said.

The besuited directors of a more humane, liberalised and inclusive capitalism -\\\\xa0a Democratic Party type of capitalism\\\\xa0- were being usurped in favour of the rabid irrationality and apocalyptic bluster of the far right.  A monster was birthed. And all at the behest of a population whose frustration and ignorance, especially that of the poorer elements, had bubbled over, yielding a toxic age of unreason.\\\\xa0  Specifically, the notion of a \\\"white working class\\\" became\\\\xa0de rigueur. Liberals at dinner parties described this entity in terms which were both sorrowful and condescending.\\\\xa0Having seen a decline in their economic level, \\\"white workers\\\", it was argued, had sought solace in the catharsis provided by hatred of the \\\"other\\\" - of minority groups - and thus afforded themselves a form of cultural compensation, a sense of social superiority, as a palliative to political and economic despair.\\\\xa0  The mainstream media proliferated the same image. The rise of Trump had been facilitated by \\\"a white working class\\\" who lacked the education and agency to see they were being manipulated for demagogic ends.  \\\"The white working class\\\" became a stand-in for the age-old concept of \\\"the mob\\\", the legions of people at the bottom whose irascibility, irrationality and ignorance could be whipped up, unleashing the maelstrom; or, to say the same, \\\"the white working class\\\" became the perfect placeholder for the anxiety and prejudice of the middle classes towards the people at the bottom.   {articleGUID}   A\\\\xa0[2016 article ](https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer)from National Review[ _\\\\xa0_](https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer)captured the sneering, fearful mentality[](https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer) \\\\xa0to a tee: \\\"The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\\\"  Without delving into the dubious sociological merits of the concept of \\\"the white working class\\\" - i.e. a group of workers on a nationwide scale who have a social basis and a set of interests fundamentally at odds with the working classes as a whole - one should note that the purveyors and peddlers of such a fiction have a hard time coming to grips with the notion of class per se.  Indeed, most of the polls that took place in 2016 relating to the presidential election defined class, specifically the working class, in purely cosmetic terms. The methodological criteria did not depend on information about how people earned their living but rather revolved around more superficial considerations like whether they had college degrees or not - without taking into account that many such people, who supported Trump, were affluent despite their lack of a university education.  > The concept of a 'white working class' who voted in droves for Trump, allows a more mundane truth to be masked.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   However, the biggest survey to take the measure of the 2016 election carried out by the American National Election Study revealed that, among \\\"people who said they voted for Trump in the general election,\\\\xa035 percent had household incomes under $50,000 per year\\\".  A similar statistic came out of a March 2016 NBC survey which showed that \\\"only a third of Trump supporters had household incomes at or below the national median of about $50,000. Another third made $50,000 to $100,000, and another third made $100,000 or more, and that was true even when we limited the analysis to only non-Hispanic whites.\\\" If one assumes that working class jobs tend to fall at the lower end of the economic spectrum, then one has to conclude that the vast majority of Trump supporters in the run-up to the 2016 election were simply not of the working class.  But the concept of a \\\"white working class\\\" who voted in droves for Trump, allows a more mundane truth to be masked.\\\\xa0In 2008, when [Barack Obama](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/barack-obama.html) swept into the White House on the heady promise of \\\"change\\\", 61.6 percent of those eligible to vote in the population did so. Yet in 2016, when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic candidate\\\\xa0that number [had fallen](https://www.factcheck.org/2009/01/2008-voter-turnout/) drastically to 58.1 percent\\\\xa0- millions of those who turned out before now chose to stay at home. What had changed?  During his\\\\xa0eight years in office, Obama failed to deliver on the alternative and transformative politics voters had been encouraged to expect. He promised to close the prison camp and torture hotbed of [Guantanamo](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/guantanamo-bay.html). He didn't.  He swore to recall all US troops from the bloody quagmire of Iraq, but US forces were still being sent there during the final year of his presidency.\\\\xa0He helped create a more militarised police force and under his watch the slaying of unarmed blacks, including children, became epidemic.\\\\xa0  And while Trump's toxic anti-immigration policies are sufficiently well known, what is not common knowledge is how\\\\xa0under Obama's tenure more than 2.5 million people were deported, a figure which exceeds that of any previous president.  Obama broke his pledge on introducing \\\"card checks\\\" - a system that would have made access to union membership for workers easier. At the same time, he fortified the rapacious and corrupt cabal of bankers and financiers who had helped facilitate the global economic crisis by barring the justice department from prosecuting those at the top of the largest banks. And, of course, he bailed out the banks.  A deteriorating, increasingly defunct form of managerial capitalism established by slick corporate figures rang more and more hollow, and swaths of people lost the impetus and motivation to vote for Clinton in 2016 - precisely because she offered much of the same. The concept of \\\"the white working class\\\", however, helps rescue this rather jaundiced liberalism from the mire, for it allows the pro-Clintonite liberal to perform a rather neat reversal.  The move from Obama to Trump is no longer conceived of in terms of the shattered promises made by those at the top of the Democratic Party as they endeavour to better grease the neoliberal machine through the promotion of a glittering financial elite and the prosaic, murderous routines of empire.  Rather it is recast in a melancholy lament for a more rational age, whereby a more humane set of political actors are eventually and tragically consumed by a political barbarism which has been foisted upon the nation courtesy of those at the bottom, the spectre of Trump issuing out of the seething, furious tumult of \\\"the white working class\\\".\\\\xa0   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Here be monsters: Trump's \\\"white working class\\\"\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/monsters-trump-white-working-class-180117104213439.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ For fixers, news stories are often personal.  They are locals, sometimes journalists themselves, who serve as guides for foreign correspondents.  Equipped with intimate local knowledge, they find stories, secure interviews, and translate for correspondents who may have little experience in the country they are reporting from.  Long after those correspondents have left, fixers remain in their communities.  If they become associated with a controversial story, the consequences can be severe - public backlash, imprisonment or worse - regardless of whether the fixer had any influence over how the story was told.  In 2017, 450 fixers and reporters were asked about their relationship for a [survey](https://globalreportingcentre.org/fixers/) by the Global Reporting Centre.  Most fixers said they felt they were often or always relied upon for logistical guidance; many said they believed their trust had been violated - some in terms of editorial content, for others the violation related to financial matters. Many said they rarely received credit for a story and a small number said they - or their relatives - had been put in future harm.  But the possibility of helping to shape how their countries are represented in the media can be a powerful pull.

Three months ago our university organised a cricket tournament and I was selected best player.  I grew up inside camps with a lot of other people. There were six rooms in a shelter and each room was eight by 10 feet. Outside of my house, there were a lot of families, at least 30 or more.  My childhood memories [involve a lot] of struggles because we didn 9t get any facilities for studying or [medical care] and we don 9t have any permanent rights as human beings.   {articleGUID}   The sky that I saw, the environment I was in from the time I woke up in until the time I went to bed was the same. We have been passing our long years [here].  It was very heartbreaking [for my family]. Around the time I was born, my five- or six-year-old brother Noor Islam died because of the lack of proper treatment.  Even now, most of the Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh but they don't get proper treatment.  You are a human being. Is it possible to live with only primary medical support? I am asking you. Is it possible to live through a dangerous sickness or life-threatening problem - is primary treatment enough for you? I think not.  For the past five years, I have been fixing and translating with media. I get pleasure from this work.  I have worked with many different journalists so now I can give comments or suggestions or reports, because I have knowledge about a certain topic.  [One story I helped fix for Arabic-speaking outlets] was about Jamalida. Jamalida was one of the brave girls who was raped by the military and lost her husband who she loved very much.  I become nervous listening to some stories because I have no words to tell them, nothing to explain their situation.  It is important to me to meet many kinds of people and communities. I can learn many things just from hearing someone explain their feelings, and I can be a witness to their problem or condition or situation.   {articleGUID}   Another important thing is showing hospitality. For a guy who comes to take photos or do a report, I can guide him and share many things with him.  Another point is that I don't have other options being a Rohingya refugee. After I finish studying, what would I do, who would accept me, how would I get a job in Bangladesh or somewhere else? I don't know, but there is nothing preventing me from being a fixer and I do useful work.  Most of the people I work with love me and are supportive of my education.  My parents also motivate me and support me. But my family still cannot support me for my education because they don't have much money.  Sometimes I face difficult situations. Last year, I couldn't pay my semester fee and I felt like I had failed. I felt totally senseless and I cried. **** But by the blessings of the mighty God, I asked one of my friends if they could help and I collected money from others.  I motivate myself and have set goals for my life, including completing my graduation.

Seven-year-old Ah-jeong twirls, her flowered hanbok -\\\\xa0a traditional Korean dress -\\\\xa0encircling her in a cloud of pink tulle and bedazzled shoes shimmering in the sunlight. She sings and laughs.  Seollal is one of South Korea's most important family holidays, a three-day affair over the Korean New Year that brings together paternal relatives in ancestral homage.  Ah-jeong and her mom are not going to celebrate with family, but with a group of women and children who mostly, like them, have nowhere else to go.  This holiday programme is organised by the Korean Unwed Mothers' Families Association (KUMFA) and offers family to those who've been cast out, to varying degrees, from their own.  This year, around 30 single moms and their children are visiting from around and beyond Seoul.  In a country where unwed mothers are derided and ostracised, this is more than a simple celebration. It's a public announcement: They refuse to be silenced or shamed.  \\\"Unwed mothers are invisible here in Korea,\\\" Jeong, a 37-year-old family support centre coordinator from Suwon, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"But we are courageous, and we are strong. We deserve to be part of society.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/27/1ab1637cbac64f74b923682525779e4c_18.jpg)  ---   Kim Do-kyeong, 43 and mother of one and KUMFA's president [Ann Babe/Al Jazeera]      In South Korea, Confucian culture and a hierarchical society mean that bloodlines play a dominant role in defining community.  For ostracised single mothers, to be without family ties is to be a social outcast. And while it's tough all year round, it is far more painful during the holiday season.  Government statistics show there are about 25,000 single mothers in South Korea, a figure questioned by KUMFA and the Korean Unwed Mothers Support Network who believe there are those who do not register due to fear of discrimination.  \\\"Relatives gathering for holidays often don't want unmarried mothers attending because it reminds them that there's a black sheep in the family,\\\" said Hye- ryeon Noh, a professor of social welfare at Soongsil University.   {articleGUID}   \\\"It's a real stigma to the family itself and a sign that they didn't raise the woman well.\\\"  For Jeong, her most heartbreaking Seollal was the one she spent alone in 2011, eight months pregnant with Ah-jeong.  Jeong had already split up with her boyfriend when she found out she was pregnant at 29. He denied the baby was his and refused to support her.  Crushed by shame, she was too scared to face her parents or seek outside help and ended up giving birth alone.  \\\"Society tells unwed mothers it's their fault, and they are not responsible people,\\\" said Jeong before adding that, because of widespread cultural bias, it was difficult for unmarried mothers to maintain family relationships, find jobs, make friends and meet a partner.  \\\"I had no confidence that I could survive as an unwed mother in Korea.\\\"  Within the first month of motherhood, Jeong felt so desperate she gave her baby up for adoption.  Three days later, she reversed her decision, realising the only thing harder than being a single mother was not being a mother at all.  To regain custody, Jeong had to bring her parents to the agency to sign a consent form and pay a fee. That's when her parents first learned of their granddaughter.  \\\"My father rejected her. He insisted I had to let her live in the adoption agency ... because he thought I wasn't qualified to be a mother.\\\"  Angry and humiliated, her father begrudgingly allowed Ah-jeong back into their family but demanded they keep her a secret.  That is when Jeong went in search of a new family, eventually finding KUMFA.   A different kind of family  KUMFA was conceived of by a group of single mothers who, grappling with prejudice, reached out to each other online and decided to meet and formalise their community offline.  Among the founding group was Kim Do-kyeong, a 43-year-old single mother of one, who serves as KUMFA's president.  Up until her son Tae-ho, now 11, reached first grade, Kim's parents shunned them, telling her to give him away and start life over.  They excluded her from celebrations and told neighbours made-up stories of a husband working abroad, all to protect the family's reputation.  For Tae-ho, who has grown up among his mom's community, it feels like his community, too. When Tae-ho is bullied at school by classmates whose mothers have instructed them not to play with him, or who tease him for being without a father, he turns to his KUMFA friends, Kim said.  In addition, the members also advocate for increased government support for single mothers, only a small fraction of whom receive any financial assistance from their children's fathers.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/27/bf46c45d152d4f4993d27e8ccde87435_18.jpg)  ---  Yoonori is one of the games the children enjoyed during the celebrations [Ann Babe/Al Jazeera]     Under the current welfare policy, single mothers can receive a maximum monthly allowance of\\\\xa0South Korean won 180,000 ($167), said professor Noh, but only if they meet stringent restrictions on age and income, including their family's income.  To qualify, single mothers younger than 24 must earn less than\\\\xa0South Korean won 1.71 million ($1,590) a month, and those older than that should earn less than\\\\xa0South Korean won 1.48m ($1,376). This, advocates argue, disincentivises them from working fulltime.  \\\"You can see from the system that there's an underlying judgment of unmarried mothers,\\\" said Noh, adding that for a long time there has been widespread opposition to raising the monthly allowance for fear it would encourage more out-of-wedlock births.   Wishes for the new year  The day before the New Year, Jeong, Kim and other mothers had congregated with their kids at the Seoul Youth Hostel to kick off the festivities.  Some had joined out of necessity.  \\\"Korean society does not accept us,\\\" said Dong Na-rae, a 35-year-old office manager, gesturing to her six-year-old son Yoon-joon. \\\"We didn't have anywhere else to go for the Lunar New Year, so we came here.\\\"  Others came because they prefer their KUMFA sisterhood to their biological family.  \\\"My son likes it here at the camp more than with my family,\\\" said Kim Min- seung, a 43-year-old employee at the department of education, who gave birth to Dong-hyeok on her 33rd birthday. \\\"When we go to my family for the holiday, it doesn't feel like a holiday. It's uncomfortable and awkward.\\\"  Together, the mothers and kids walked through Namsan Hanok Village. They took part in traditional Seollal games: yoonnori, played with sticks, a board and markers; and paengi, wooden tops twirled with whipcords.  They enjoyed a curry rice dinner and opened some small gifts.  All around them, the usually frenetic city was hushed - traffic tamed, pedestrians sparse and many of the shops either shuttered or posting signs listing reduced hours.  For the moms and their kids, though, their little corner of the world was a joyous racket, but they all knew that the next morning, life would go back to normal.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/27/fad1bd4b59784160a762a0eb03107138_18.jpg)  ---  Happy children during the celebrations at Namsam [Ann Babe/Al Jazeera]    ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"The stigma of being a single mother in South Korea\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/stigma-single-mother-south-korea-180226144516720.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ On February 13, 2008, the country 9s then prime minister formally apologised to generations of [Aboriginal children](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/2012716122018878595.html) who had been \\\"stolen\\\" from their families by the state in an attempt to integrate them into \\\"[white Australia](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2014/06 /immigration-nation-201461982321610712.html)\\\".

In the 70 years since its founding, the NHS, with its core value of free healthcare for all at the point of delivery, has become not only an intrinsic part of British life, but also an inspiration around the world.  But, as it struggles to cope with funding cuts and an ageing population, the future of the service, and its international reputation is uncertain.   Winters of discontent  On Wednesday, NHS England took the [unprecedented step](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/uk-nhs-delays-non-urgent- operations-winter-pressures-180104101653207.html) of suspending all non-urgent procedures until the end of January.  The move is designed to free up staff and beds to deal with emergency patients and is expected to affect around 55,000 operations such as cataracts and hip replacements.  British Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/theresa.html) apologised to patients whose operations had been postponed while visiting a hospital on Thursday.  \\\"I know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know its disappointing for people and I apologise,\\\" she said.  Healthcare staff are always under pressure in January as cold weather, flu and higher levels of respiratory illnesses put hospitals under strain.  \\\"The NHS is currently experiencing serious challenges due to peaks in demand that occur during the winter period,\\\" said Andrew Seaton, a historian of the NHS at New York University.  \\\"This has become somewhat of an annual event, though this year looks particularly serious as 21 NHS Trusts have declared a 'black alert', meaning they can no longer guarantee patient safety, nor run a full range of services,\\\" he told Al Jazeera.  This winter has seen reports of individuals waiting 12 hours to see a doctor and patients being treated in corridors.  New data released by [NHS England](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/06/nhs-england- glance-170607133653632.html) on Thursday showed a 95 percent rise in the number of patients stuck in ambulances for at least an hour during the week of December 25-31\\\\xa0- with 4,700 cases up from 2,400 the week before.

By limiting migration, the medical profession is likely to suffer and people are likely to suffer,\\\" he said.  Seaton agreed noting some of the NHS's EU and overseas workers, more than 17 percent of the service's total workforce, are leaving because of Brexit uncertainty.  \\\"The NHS has always relied on overseas workers, right back to the very beginning when it quickly began recruiting doctors and nurses from Commonwealth nations.

In any case, Macaron argued that Saudi Arabia's \\\"emboldened\\\" foreign posture, which accompanied [leadership changes in January 2015](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/bin-salman-saudi-consensus- rule-171107052615928.html), worked with little regard for US objections.  \\\"The first two major crises Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in; the war against the Houthis [in Yemen] and severing ties with Tehran, were a reaction to President Obama's decision to sign the nuclear deal with Iran.  \\\"Once Trump came to power and signalled Iran as a foe, Mohammed Bin Salman shifted focus to consolidating power at home, which led to the embargo against Qatar and [Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri's] mysterious resignation.\\\"   Iran nuclear deal: 'Strong degree of continuity'  While the Saudis may have welcomed Trump's ascent to the presidency, for Iranians, his presidency represents a continuation of Obama-era policy, according to the University of Tehran's Professor Mohammad Marandi.\\\\xa0       ---   Rouhani to Trump: Iran will not be intimidated      Trump has repeatedly railed against the deal, describing it as the \\\"worst deal ever\\\" despite objections from his European allies.  Iran and and world powers, including the US, signed the JCPOA in 2015 after years of diplomatic wrangling between western and Iranian diplomats.  The eventual agreement, saw Iran reduce the number of centrifuges that were capable of enriching Uranium to the levels required to produce a nuclear weapon.  In exchange, some US sanctions were lifted and frozen Iranian funds were released.  The deal was widely seen as one of Obama's most significant diplomatic achievements but tensions between Tehran and Washington remained tense. \\\\xa0  In October, Trump [refused to recertify](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/iran-nuclear-deal-donald- trump-decertifies-2015-pact-171012101055479.html) that Iran was in compliance with the agreement. The move put the onus on Congress to restore sanctions and dismantle the deal, but that did not happen. Most recently, Trump again waived Iran nuclear sanctions, vowing it would be the \\\"last time\\\" he would do so unless changes are made to the agreement.\\\\xa0  Marandi said that Trump's threat to scrap or renegotiate the deal are nothing new, and that the US had not honoured the deal under Obama.  \\\"There is a strong degree of continuity, because Trump, like Obama, violated the JCPOA repeatedly,\\\" he said referring to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over Iran's ballistic missile programme after the nuclear deal was signed.  Where Trump's threat over the nuclear deal has had an effect is on Iran's future readiness to discuss other isues with the US.  According to Marandi, a US failure to abide by the conditions set out in the JCPOA, would confirm Iranian suspicions that the US could never be relied upon to respect a deal.  \\\"Until this agreement is fully implemented, there is no way whatsoever that the Iranians are going to negotiate with the Americans over anything else.  \\\"This is a litmus test for Iran ... the very fact that the US has violated the current agreement, so repeatedly, under both administrations, shows that if the Iranians appeased the Americans and went for further talks, they would simply behave in the same way in the future.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"One year of Trump: The impact on the Middle East\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/year-trump-impact-middle-east-180118085425669.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ [Iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html) has restricted access to the Instagram and Telegram social media apps as a security measure during rare anti-government protests, according to state TV.

Although fluent in Greek, its grey-haired inhabitants share news, jokes and thoughts in their indigenous tongue: a unique variety of Arabic heavily influenced by Aramaic, the language of Jesus.  They are descendants of Christians who fled to Cyprus from modern-day Syria and Lebanon in four successive waves from the late 7th century onwards.  Less than 50 years ago, Kormakitis was home to about 2,000 people. It was the beating heart of the island's small but vibrant Maronite community.  But then in 1974, a brief Greece-backed coup prompted a military intervention by Turkish forces, which effectively divided the island between a Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south.  The Maronites, who resided in four neighbouring northern villages, suddenly found themselves in the middle of an ethnic conflict that would have a devastating effect on their community.  Their ancestral villages, which had for centuries shielded their culture and customs, were instantly seized by the Turkish army. Overnight, about 80 percent of Cyprus' Maronites were uprooted, seeking shelter in the Greek- speaking south.  But in Kormakitis, the largest of the villages, hundreds opted to stay behind.  They were unharmed by the fighting, but life became increasingly difficult. With work opportunities shrinking and the village's only school shut, many - especially the youth - felt they had no choice but to leave Kormakitis for the more affluent south.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/9a328608c4174fccb60be69ec39f9291_18.jpg)  ---  Kormakitis is home today to about 100 year-round residents [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     Yet for some, abandoning Kormakitis was never an option.  \\\"Where could I have gone?\\\" Skordis asks, without waiting for an answer. \\\"This is where my father was born and died; my mother and siblings, too. I've been a farmer all my life and everything I've done, I've done it here.\\\"  In the end, some 120 Maronites remained \\\"enclaved\\\" in Kormakitis, living north of a United Nations-controlled no-man's land dividing the Mediterranean island.  For decades, before the easing of border restrictions in 2003, the villagers would need to secure special permission to see their displaced loved ones in person. Contact was brief and sporadic.  \\\"Life was lonely,\\\" recalls 71-year-old Annetta Maurohanna, who has been working at the cafe by the imposing St George Cathedral in the heart of Kormakitis for the past 30 years.  \\\"But I didn't want to leave,\\\" she adds. \\\"Everyone craves to be at home.\\\"  Each week, a UN truck would visit the largely cut off villagers to deliver foodstuffs, medicine and other vital supplies.  \\\"You'd have to have been here to be able to understand the hardship that we went through,\\\" says Skordis, a father of six, pausing to hold back tears.  \\\"Three of my daughters sent me messages before their weddings saying they didn't have any money to get married - and I couldn't send them any,\\\" he continues. \\\"We suffered a lot, and that's why we now avoid remembering those times, so we don't get upset.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/58baf2be34a4493795dfeba964c1c869_18.jpg)  ---  Kormakitis resident Annetta Maurohanna, 71: \\\"My village means everything to me - all my life, all my memories\\\" [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     Today, the island's Maronites number an estimated 6,000 people.  They are scattered across southern towns and villages, bar the band of elderly farmers, herdsmen and pensioners residing in Kormakitis and a handful of families living in Karpasha, further southeast.  Two other nearby Maronite villages - Asomatos and Ayia Marina (a previously mixed Maronite and Turkish Cypriot village) - are empty of their residents and now used by the Turkish army as military bases.\\\\xa0  About half of the Maronite population is believed to trace its roots back to Kormakitis, and the vast majority of them have been allowed to repair their previously deserted houses. Its residents have ownership rights and can also sell or rent their land, as well as inherit it, but subject to specific conditions.\\\\xa0  The village comes alive again on weekends and holidays, its square filled with children and its cafes and tavernas overflowing with patrons.  The school remains shut, but in the summer children here attend short language camps to learn Cypriot Maronite Arabic (CMA), referred to locally as Sanna.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/13/fae5fb08ebfa45188f024c0943162715_8.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     Passed down from generation to generation through everyday conversation, the centuries-old CMA is a variant of Arabic that's rooted in Aramaic but has taken words from Greek, Turkish and Latin.  It is classified as a \\\"seriously endangered\\\" language by the Council of Europe, while 10 years ago experts created a written alphabet with the aim of codifying and preserving it.  Mysteriously, the ancient dialect is only spoken by Kormakitis natives and not by any others Maronites from the community's other remaining villages. Until 1974, children in Kormakitis would only begin learning Greek in the first grade.  \\\"Currently, about 1,000 people speak our language, but they're all aged over 40 and 50,\\\" says Mihalis Hadjiroussos, chairman of the Xki Fi Sanna NGO.  The group, whose name translates to \\\"Speak Our Language\\\", was set up more than a decade ago to protect and promote CMA through summer camps, afternoon lessons and cultural activities.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/9271898286314e6ca8191ec2cb5639a1_18.jpg)  ---  Mihalis Hadjiroussos, 70: \\\"Cyprus is our homeland and Lebanon is our second homeland\\\" [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     But such revival efforts don't go very far.  Following international pressure, the Cypriot government in 2008 recognised CMA as a minority language, but it did not formally incorporate it into the education system.  That means that summer camps and afternoon classes aside, many younger Maronites see little use in learning a moribund language - distancing themselves further from their endangered community's identity.  \\\"Our chance to survive as a community, and to save our language, is to go back to our villages,\\\" says Hadjiroussos, 70, sitting around other elderly Maronites in their community's club in Nicosia, Cyprus's capital.  \\\"If 2,000 people go back to the village and stay there then the right conditions will be created for people to speak the language - and for weddings between people from the village to take place.\\\"  That's at the heart of Maronites' fears over their community's looming extinction.  Dispersed among Greek Cypriots and away from their parents' villages, the overwhelming majority of Maronites - an estimated nine out of 10 - marry outside their community.  Giorgos Skordis, a 47-year-old actuary, is a rare exception. His wife, Antoinetta, was the last person to be born in Kormakitis, while the couple's wedding in 2008 was the first in the village after 1974.  \\\"The community has been almost fully assimilated,\\\" says Skordis, in a cafe in Nicosia.  \\\"Many, perhaps even most [Maronites], have started feeling like Greeks. Even though they came from Lebanon, spoke Arabic and ethnically they're not Greeks - owing to their schooling, mixed weddings and displacement,\\\" he explains.  \\\"And the ones who don't feel like that, they're forced to, in a way, because their children and their grandchildren are Greek Cypriots.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/4fb0d845364d47529299552a37ba9f5a_18.jpg)  ---  The \\\"Kormakitis\\\" cafe is a regular meeting spot for Maronites in Nicosia [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     Cyprus is home to one of the world's longest-running frozen conflicts.  Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders have long worked towards a deal to reunify the island, but several UN-mediated attempts to reach an agreement have collapsed, often in mutual recrimination, insults and anger.  Amid the charged and pervasive reality of a divided Cyprus, smaller communities such as the Maronites feel trapped between two fronts.  \\\"Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have massive differences, and we are the victims of that,\\\" says Haji Roussos.  He should know.  As a non-voting representative of the Maronite community in Cyprus's House of Representatives for 20 years, Haji Roussos experienced marginalisation first- hand.  \\\"I once met the US ambassador and told him that, 'We won't be able to survive without support,'\\\" Haji Roussos says. \\\"He responded, 'I realise this,\\\\xa0you are like the ball in a ping pong match being hit around, but we can't do anything about it.'\\\"  Under the Republic of Cyprus Constitution of 1960, the Maronite community is recognised as a \\\"religious group\\\" but not a minority.  Haji Roussos and others have long campaigned for the change of the community's status - but to no avail.  \\\"Although there was goodwill on behalf of the [Greek Cypriot] government and the parliament, but they used the argument that they couldn't change the Constitution,\\\" he says.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/bbe769d4cdba4988a6799e5df35cd9e6_18.jpg)  ---  Antonis Haji Roussos, ex-Maronite representative in Greek Cypriot parliament [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]     At independence in 1960, Cyprus's bicommunal constitution arranged for a Greek Cypriot president and Turkish Cypriot deputy, in a power-sharing agreement that was short-lived.  Solely identified as a \\\"religious group\\\", the island's Maronites, Armenians and Latins were asked to choose which of the two largest communities to join and all three opted to be identified as Greek Cypriots due to religious affinity and linguistic and cultural bonds - adding yet another layer to the island's complex reality.  \\\"The Cyprus problem is presented as simply a Greek-Turkish problem, which results in all other important matters being ignored and side-stepped,\\\" says Costas Constantinou, a professor of international relations at the University of Cyprus.  \\\"There is assimilation, while others say that the Cyprus problem shouldn't be complicated any further by also looking at the issues of minority groups,\\\" he adds.  Last summer, Turkish Cypriot leaders announced that a plan would be presented about the opening up of the rest of Maronite villages to their former inhabitants and the completion of infrastructure work to make resettlement possible.  Not much has since happened, but the Greek Cypriot side at the time rejected the move, calling it \\\"communications tricks\\\" and\\\\xa0part of a plan to not place such villages under Greek Cypriot administration after a solution to the island's division is reached.  Back in Kormakitis, Maurohanna, the cafe server who has known no other home than this village, said time is of the essence.  \\\"We sacrificed ourselves and we managed to keep our villages,\\\" she says.  \\\"But if no people return, everything will cease to exist.  \\\"This is what we want: a peaceful resolution to the Cyprus problem and everybody to come back.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/12/d13a81ebe7fe4395a86f4ba93e728718_18.jpg)  ---  The interior of St George Cathedral in Kormakitis [Dimitris Sideridis/Al Jazeera]    ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Cypriot Maronites: Ancient community facing extinction\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/cypriot-maronites-ancient-community-facing-extinction-180212173312467.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Emmerson Bockarie,\\\\xa0Sierra Leonean musician, laughs a lot for someone who receives personal insults from the president and anonymous death threats with the release of every new single.  A thorn in the side of successive governments over his 15-year career,\\\\xa0Bockarie chuckles as he recalls\\\\xa0the countless times politicians have sought to dampen his appeal, and the\\\\xa0countless times they have failed.  \\\"Politicians make mentions of my music on TV and radio. That means they hear the songs and are getting the message,\\\" he notes with delight, settling down for an interview with AFP at his Freetown studio.  Better known simply as \\\"Emmerson\\\", the Afrobeat singer is the bete noire of Sierra Leone's music scene, one of few successful artists who refuse to play political rallies or back a party in a nation where rappers and singers are co-opted for their youth appeal.  With a new president due to be elected on Tuesday, Emmerson\\\\xa0Bockarie says he expects fresh inspiration for his soft yet scathing lyrics - whoever wins - as the ruling All Peoples' Congress (APC) faces off against the main opposition Sierra Leone Peoples' Party (SLPP).  The two parties have ruled the country alternately since independence in 1961.  \\\"I stand with the people; I am with the country,\\\" he enthuses. \\\"It makes no sense for me to belong to a political party.\\\"  Consistent criticism  Emmerson began making music in the local Krio language after [Sierra Leone](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/sierra-leone.html)'s civil war ended in 2002, when he had just left school.  His first single \\\"Yu Go See Am\\\" ridiculed government officials stuffing their faces and skimming money off state funds while ordinary citizens went hungry.  \\\"The (then) president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, was like: it's better for them to sing than to go back to the bush and be rebels,\\\" he explains, referring to the legions of child and youth soldiers.  These days, he is heavily engaged in civic education, collaborating with four other artists on the song \\\"Mi vote na mi life\\\" last year to encourage voters deeply split along tribal and regional lines to consider policies when making their choice.  \\\"Emmerson songs are about issues affecting ordinary people,\\\" explained Murtala Mohamed Kamara, publisher of entertainment publication the Salone Jamboree.  \\\"He has been consistent with his criticism and advocacy for change without bias to any government,\\\" he added.   'No easy eh'  A typical Emmerson song will encompass mockery of politicians' greed and uselessness, tributes to Sierra Leone and its long-suffering people, and some element of hope for the future.  His lyrics about poverty - \\\"wi weh no born mit money/ less opportunity/ still wi wan be somebody/ e no easy eh\\\" - reflect the frustrations of young people in a country with high unemployment and enduring social injustice.  \\\"I started listening to Emmerson's music in 2007, and I still love him for telling the truth,\\\" fan Ophaniel Gooding told AFP.  But his riotously successful songs have made him some powerful enemies.  \\\"I know there are propaganda machines out there organised by the government to go against my music on social media,\\\" Emmerson says.  \\\"Sometimes you have phone calls, text messages, Facebook... 'We will light you up. If I ever see you that will be your last day'.\\\" he adds, eyes widening beneath the brim of a baseball cap.  And that is before his much-publicised war of words with outgoing President Ernest Bai Koroma, who is accused of failing to address corruption and the economic fallout of the 2014-16 Ebola crisis.  \\\"The president referred to me as a fly, that he would just blow me off,\\\" Emmerson laughs, with a mock dismissive flick of the hand.  Emmerson got his revenge by sampling a soundbite of Koroma's hand-picked successor, Samura Kamara, in the opening strains of his election-inspired hit, Good Do.  The former foreign minister admitted during a February campaign debate that the ruling party was responsible for the deplorable conditions in some parts of the country.  \\\"I blame the government,\\\" Kamara is heard admitting before Emmerson is recorded laughing over the presidential candidate's words.   'My fight'  The singer sincerely believes he provides an information service for citizens, the majority of whom are illiterate and only hear government \\\"lies\\\" from TV and radio.  But the fierce pride of his fans takes a toll. He is separated from his wife, blaming the all-consuming nature of his music, and admits he has \\\"no time\\\" for himself.  \\\"Whatever happens in the country, people go 'Emmerson!' They go: 'where's Emmerson?' Am I a village, a town crier?\\\" he asks, smiling with just a hint of irritation.  Technology has also complicated his life. Previously he relied on CD and cassette sales to make money, and although YouTube and iTunes have given him a global reach, locals are now more likely to pirate his music.  He is currently concentrating his energies on a label, Sugar Entertainment, that is nurturing a new generation of artists.  But what motivates him on a daily basis is his \\\"dream\\\" for Sierra Leone, for a nation free of injustice and ethnic conflict, with jobs for everyone and a freer political system.  But he will never be the one to lead his people to this brighter future.  If I go into politics, who would be doing what I'm doing?

Difficult to eradicate, the tradition has pressured couples into undergoing selective [abortion](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/abortion.html), choosing to continue a pregnancy only if the unborn child is male.  The practice, commonly known as \\\"female selective abortion\\\", is relatively new but it has deep roots.  If the practice continues, [Montenegro](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/montenegro.html), which has a population of just over 620,000, will have up to 10,000 more men than women by 2025, even though women's longer life expectancies mean there are normally more women than men in a national population.  Pregnant women in Montenegro often undertake a prenatal test to determine the gender of their babies. Such tests cost 350 euro ($433) and do not require the involvement of a gynaecologist.  However, many mothers go to [Serbia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/serbia.html) to avoid bureaucratic restrictions.  This practice has long been an open secret in Montenegro but it is now being called out publicly by the Women's Rights Center, which has launched a campaign called \\\"Unwanted\\\".  The campaign aims to raise public awareness with newspaper articles and posters appearing around the capital, Podgorica, showing an image of a girl with the words \\\"Your parents wanted a son and that's why you did not have a chance to be born ... Sorry\\\".\\\\xa0  \\\"This topic is not well received by the Montenegrin public,\\\" said Maja Raicevic, the head of the Women's Rights Center. \\\"That is always the case with issues concerning the relationship between men and women and the questioning of cultural and traditionalist norms.\\\"  \\\"This is a very negative tradition that we must fight every day, because this is the 21st Century. People are reluctant to address issues that touch on the cultural and traditional roots of our society but we cannot get anywhere by sweeping the problem under the carpet.  \\\"The aim of our campaign is to launch a social dialogue that goes beyond the value system in which women do not enjoy the same rights as men. This problem concerns the position of women in all sectors of society and the consequences are so drastic that there is a rising number of selective abortions in Montenegro and growing misuse of prenatal tests,\\\"\\\\xa0Raicevic said.  Campaigners have dedicated a small memorial to the memory of the baby girls who were never born near the monument of St. Peter Cetinje in Podgorica's university park.  Gynaecologist Milano Rolovic believes that the problem of selective abortion is complex and centres on the education and patriarchal tradition of Montenegrin society.  \\\"Our young people think about their heirs in the same way that their ancestors did in the last century,\\\" he said. \\\"The dynasty must continue so a man has the task of leaving his surname while a woman marries and extends somebody else's family line.\\\"  Demographic statistics confirm that while the global average for newborns is 100 females for every 102 males, in Montenegro the average for newborns is 100 females to 116 males.  Campaigners fear that it may require a long and more intimate exposure to different cultures to convince future generations in Montenegro to abandon the wide-scale killing of the unborn based simply on their gender.  ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Girls unwanted: 'This is not a country for women'\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/girls-unwanted-country-women-180306133650069.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ A teachers strike in [Argentina](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/argentina.html) this week has turned the spotlight on the country's failing public school system.

Trump targeted North Korea, even as Pyongyang is negotiating with South Korea ahead of next month's [Winter Olympics](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/olympics.html), with wrenchingly emotional criticism, resurrecting the story of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died in a coma after detention in North Korea last year.  Trump acknowledged Warmbier's parents sitting in the gallery, saying the US would remember their son's death with resolve. The president told the story of Ji Seong-ho, a North Korean defector also sitting in the House gallery.   How Trump rates countries  The president decried the December 22 vote at the United Nations, condemning his Jerusalem move, and promised again there would be retribution for the 128 nations who voted against the US.  \\\"I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign assistance dollars always serve America's interests and only go to America's friends,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Trump is a curious personality who clearly equates countries treating him well with countries treating the United States well,\\\" Daniel W Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law, Tufts University, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"So, if Saudi Arabia pulls out all the stops with the glowing orb or China dazzles with the Forbidden City, he is going to be impressed by that, and it is going to have an effect on his opinion of that country,\\\" Drezner added.  In [Afghanistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html), the president said US forces are unshackled by \\\"new rules of engagement\\\" and would work with \\\"heroic Afghan partners\\\" unconstrained by a withdrawal timeline.  Separately, Defense Department officials said yesterday the US was sending 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the US force there to about 15,000 US service members.  Trump announced an intent to resurrect the detentions of enemy combatants begun by former President George W Bush after the September 11, 2001, attacks and said he would keep open the prison camp at [Guantanamo Bay](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/guantanamo-bay.html), which Obama had attempted to close,\\\\xa0but failed.   What do Trump's words mean for foreign policy?  Trump reiterated his criticism of the \\\"terrible\\\" Iran nuclear deal, reached by Obama through diplomacy, and said, \\\"when the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.  \\\"America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\\\"       ---   **WATCH:** [US immigrants 'living in fear' of Trump's deportation drive (02:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIGjbkv6ScM)      Kim Wallace, Eurasia Group managing director and a former Obama Treasury Department official, said:\\\\xa0\\\"There is a global diaspora trying to understand what Trump's words mean for foreign policy.  \\\"Trump's bark is much worse than his bite when it comes to foreign policy, [including] both geostrategic and geopolitical and trade policy.\\\"  While Trump refrained from inflammatory language on international trade, his evocation of patriotic American themes, reminiscent of his red-white-and-blue campaign appearances, sparked a chant of \\\"USA, USA, USA!\\\" from enthusiastic Republicans.  Democrats, many of whom were largely unresponsive during the speech, left the chamber as soon as Trump finished speaking, turning their backs on the president while he was still on the podium.  \\\"There is no question that at the level of global public opinion, across the board, with very few exceptions there has been a negative response to the president of the United States,\\\" said Shibley Telhami, a pollster and the Anwar Sadat professor of peace and development at the University of Maryland.   'America is divided'  Within the US, domestic public opinion is increasingly polarised.  Trump's speech clearly appealed to his political base of right-wing and conservative Republicans who are sticking with him in the face of the FBI's investigation of his campaign's Russia contacts, Telhami said.  \\\"Not only is America divided based on party but they are divided even on their core identities. There is a deep divide in America,\\\" Telhami said.  Democratic and Republican lawmakers diverged sharply on their assessments of Trump's foreign policy in his first year.  \\\"I think on foreign policy, he's got the best national security team around that I have seen in 20 years,\\\" Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"He's taking the fight to the Islamic State, leading from the front.

He is undercutting diplomacy at every step.\\\"  Despite Trump's claims, the reality is he has few international successes so far, analysts say.  \\\"The America First theme, what does it mean? The bottom line is that it has been America Last,\\\" said Aaron David Miller, a vice president and director of the Middle East programme at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think-tank.  \\\"This is a management game.

On Friday afternoon, the unions announced the strike will continue on Monday.  The teachers are demanding higher wages and better benefits as they struggle to afford rising [healthcare](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/healthcare.html) costs.  On both Thursday and Friday, thousands sang and chanted at the state capitol building in Charleston, calling for an agreement before the end of the legislative session on March 10.

It will be followed by a one percent increase over the next two years. The bill, however, reduces the increase that had been previously proposed.  West Virginia's public school employees are also concerned about legalising taxpayer-funded private school vouchers and increasing the number of charter schools, policies which have been at the core of US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's policy platform.   'A risk worth taking'  Though teachers have not gone on strike since 1990, teachers' unions in West Virginia rank 13th in the [United States](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html), according to a 2012 study which found that they were formidable and thoroughly engaged state politics and in developing policies.  Viewed as the birthplace of the US labour movement, West Virginia has a long history of strong unions that organised workers such as coal miners, craftsmen, and nurses to collectively bargain for improved wages, working conditions, and healthcare.  However, it is illegal under West Virginia law for public employees to go on strike, and teachers risk fines or imprisonment by continuing the walkout.  At a meeting to discuss legal ramifications, Shepherd told Al Jazeera that the response of the 300 assembled educators was unanimous: \\\"Our kids are more important.\\\"  Shepherd added: \\\"So, yes, we face that risk, but that's a risk that's worth taking because our kids and their education is so valuable to us.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/24/d2c46d5c76774ae98066058078e81c62_18.jpg)  ---  Potential next steps for the unions include returning to work for a few days before resuming the stoppage, having rolling walkouts by county, or continuing the statewide strike until changes are made [John Raby/ AP Photo]     In a statement released on February 20, West Virginia Superintendent of Schools Steven Paine noted the illegality of work stoppages by public employees and encouraged \\\"educators to advocate for the benefits they deserve, but to seek courses of action that have the least possible disruption for our students\\\".

A more recent 2017 study, which analysed 4,000 Bollywood movies, found [pervasive gender bias](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sahilrizwan/trope- tripe?utm_term=.lnrYe6ZKJ4.un5EvLl8KO) in storylines.  According to [Swati Tandon](https://www.facebook.com/swati.tandon), an Indian film producer and assistant director, misogynistic depictions of female characters are a consequence of an industry dominated by men.  \\\"We don't have a lot of women writers,\\\" she said, adding: \\\"All the female characters are being written by men and that's the reason they're very stereotypical.\\\"  That's a view shared by the head of the\\\\xa0All India Progressive Women's Association, Kavita Krishnan, who told Al Jazeera that even women who manage to break into Bollywood had little influence over the direction the film industry took.

Societal impact  Concerns about Bollywood's relationship with women are not just limited to what's shown on screen, but also extend to the impact of such portrayals on wider Indian society.  One infamous example of behaviour normalised in Bollywood is the phenomenon of \\\"eve-teasing\\\", which essentially involves a man ignoring a woman's rejection of his advances until she eventually relents to his pursuit of her.  In Bollywood movies, eve-teasing is a commonly used plot device for the development of a romantic relationship between a male protagonist and his female love interest.  In [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html) and among the Indian diaspora, eve-teasing has become a major societal issue, as men try to emulate the romantic successes of the characters they see in films.\\\\xa0  > They basically have confused romance with eve-teasing, which is extremely dangerous because that's what young kids are growing up seeing\\\\r > > Swati Tandon, Film Producer > >   Several Indian states have [introduced punitive measures](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-more-cases-of- eve-teasing-stalking-now-reaching-courts-4912958/)\\\\xa0for men who make unsolicited advances towards women, but women like film producer Tandon argue that authorities are not addressing the root of the problem.  \\\"Our media and our entertainment industry is totally dependent on society for content and society gets affected by the media, so it's very codependent on each other,\\\" Tandon told Al Jazeera.  \\\"We've grown up watching Bollywood songs where eve-teasing was a form of romance.  \\\"They basically have confused romance with eve-teasing, which is extremely dangerous because that's what young kids are growing up seeing.\\\"\\\\xa0   Female representation  The women Al Jazeera spoke to all agreed that a solution to misogyny in Bollywood would only come about when there was greater representation for women in the industry and when men were no longer relied on to produce stories about women.  \\\"One of the main ways that we'll see change is when more female directors are able to helm cameras and helm the scripts and make films for women by women,\\\" said author and columnist [Ruchika Tulshyan](https://twitter.com/rtulshyan),\\\\xa0adding she wanted to see movies where women depicted on screen are \\\"complicated and nuanced\\\".  However, whether such change is on the horizon is another topic and one feminist activist Krishnan is not optimistic about.  \\\"[Bollywood] is a very, very patriarchal industry.

It was an unnecessary, constitutionally induced, crisis that has brought the country to the brink of yet another major conflict.  This development is also a symptom of a much deeper constitutional problem, which, if not resolved, could be a recipe for disaster in the future.\\\\xa0  The 2004 Afghan constitution invests the president with more powers than former Afghan kings had before the republican period. Among them is the power to appoint all government officials, political and professional, from the cabinet to the district levels.  At the same time the office of the president, at least in practice, tends to be filled only with ethnic Pashtuns. That is why candidates view the presidency as \\\"the prize\\\" to be won at any cost.  Hence, presidential elections have become a massive exercise in fraud. [The last election](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/09/ashraf-ghani- declared-winner-afghan-poll-2014921133512174572.html) conducted in 2014 was the worst by far. Following accusations of unprecedented violations, US Secretary of State John Kerry brokered, extra-constitutionally, a national unity government for Ashraf Ghani and Abdulla Abdulla to share power, averting a likely tragedy.  The exercise of presidential rights to appoint all government officials, in an ethnically divided and tribal society, is fraught with charges of monopolising power, bias and discrimination.\\\\xa0  Because the retention of the \\\"prize\\\" necessitates reliance on kinsmen, tribesmen, and cronies, it promotes politicisation of ethnolinguistic and sectarian identities, heightening tensions and insecurity.   **A long history of centralisation and ethnic tensions**  Afghanistan inherited this trend towards centralisation from decades of political leaders trying to personalise power and exacerbating ethnic tensions.  The political culture of \\\"kingship\\\", predicated on centralisation of power in the hands of Pashtun monarchs who relied on their trusted kinsmen and tribesmen, dates back to the 1880s. Abdur Rahman Khan (1880-1901) secured the throne for himself with the help of British India, which provided him with substantial long-term subsidies of modern weapons and cash. His grandson, Shah Amanullah (1919-1929) enshrined centralism in the country's first constitution (1923).\\\\xa0  In the 1930s, King Zahir Shah came to the throne and reigned with his uncles for three decades as an absolute monarch before adopting a new constitution in 1964. The new document prevented members of the royal family from holding high positions in the government. This bold attempt at constitutional monarchy was short-lived, as Zahir Shah was removed from the throne in a military coup in 1973, led by his cousin and brother-in-law, former Prime Minster Muhammad Daoud.       ---   [UPFRONT: Hamid Karzai on the US, ISIL and war crimes (14:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC3O-JpBftk)      Daoud claimed unprecedented powers before his demise at the hands of Soviet- backed Afghan communist parties in April 1978. The communists attempted to set up centralised rule but were challenged by Western-backed anti-communist Mujahideen forces and the country plunged into civil war.  Despite the Mujahideen's military successes, they failed to form a functioning government as in-fighting erupted. These internecine conflicts further divided the country along ethnolinguistic and sectarian cleavages.  While the war for control of Kabul was raging, in the peripheries a number of powerful regional leaders consolidated power using ethnolinguistic, tribal and sectarian affiliations. Atta Muhammad Nur, of Jamiat-e-Islami party, established himself as a Tajik leader in Balkh province during this period.  The violent takeover of the primarily Pashtun [Taliban](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/taliban.html) beginning in 1995 and then the bloody US invasion of 2001 consolidated ethnic and regional divisions.   **A new old constitution**  In removing the Taliban from power, the US-led coalition forces worked closely with the commanders of the Northern Alliance who had resisted the Taliban conquest of their territories. Nur was one of the key commanders assisting the coalition. The defeat and demise of the Taliban were celebrated widely in northern Afghanistan because it afforded them a chance to govern their local communities within a decentralised national political structure. But that was not to be.  At the Bonn Conference organised by the United Nations, the monarchic-era constitution of 1964, excluding the Chapter on the King, was adopted as the legal framework for operation of the interim and transitional governments of Afghanistan. The same constitution appears to have been tweaked by the commission for drafting a new constitution and was adopted in December 2004. The Chapter on the King seems to have been renamed the Chapter on the President, granting far broader powers to the president than the former king had.  The 2004 constitution, upon the insistence of the US and its allies, included provisions guaranteeing human rights, recognition of minorities and steps towards gender equity.  However, demands for a parliamentary system and decentralised governance put forward mainly by non-Pashtuns were ignored. In this way, the country was saddled with the most inappropriate all-powerful presidential executive structure which cannot, has not, and will not be able to deliver the many positive constitutional rights of the peoples of Afghanistan.  The 2004 constitution, like all other previous constitutions of Afghanistan, denies the peoples of Afghanistan their rights to elect their governors, mayors and district officers. It also denies them the possibility to recruit or hire their professional administrators. The right of community self- governance which could have transformed the peoples of Afghanistan from subjects to empowered citizens was not considered. Thus, abuses by Kabul- appointed strangers who lord over local communities instead of serving them are rampant.  Recruitment and hiring of civil servants, when vetted by local committees, can reduce pervasive nepotism, cronyism and corruption. It could also reduce or eliminate identity politics and bridge the trust gap between state and society. Indeed, if governors were elected, Governor Nur would have been elected by the people of Balkh province, eliminating the reason for the current crisis.  Such overbearing undemocratic centralised governance structures are unacceptable in Europe and the United States. Afghanistan's 2004 constitution was produced under the auspices of the UN, US and EU. Sadly, since the firing of Governor Nur, some Western ambassadors in Kabul appear to support President Ghani's decision by demanding adherence to the \\\"rule of law\\\". This despite the fact that they know full well the absurdity and undemocratic nature of the law that has produced the current growing conflict in Afghanistan.\\\\xa0  A constitutional provision blatantly causing instability, promoting personalisation of power, nepotism, tribalism, cronyism, discrimination, politicisation of identities and a trust deficit in society should not be condoned but openly opposed by the international community.  If their desire is to enhance long-term security and stability in Afghanistan, they must help amend the constitution which, with its current provisions, breeds conflicts and contributes to a myriad of problems in struggling multi- ethnic Afghanistan.\\\\xa0   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"The Afghan president has more powers than a king\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/afghan-president-powers-king-180103050939230.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ In early February, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embarked on a Latin America tour [aimed at](https://py.usembassy.gov/secretary-state-rex- tillerson-tour-latin-america/) promoting \\\"democratic security\\\".

While there have been deep prejudice and selective reporting on other countries that have been designated as official US enemies (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia), exaggeration, monolithic and hegemonic narratives and an indifference to complexity, nuance or opposing views in the reporting on Venezuela in prestigious publications have seen new heights.\\\\xa0  Project Syndicate, for example, recently published a [typical example](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/venezuela-catastrophe- military-intervention-by-ricardo-hausmann-2018-01) of this overwhelming bias. In the article titled \\\"D-Day Venezuela\\\", the country's former planning minister, Ricardo Hausmann, called on Latin American countries to intervene militarily in Venezuela.  Even the casual observer of [Latin American](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/latin-america.html) affairs would know how absurd this idea is and not surprisingly, it met shock and indignation throughout the region.   **Why military intervention is a horrible idea**  National sovereignty is a sacrosanct political value in Latin America, for reasons obvious to anyone familiar with the history of foreign intervention in the region.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   Not only is advocating for military intervention morally reprehensible, but it is also illegal; the [Charter of the United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html) prohibits the unilateral use of force that threatens the independence of any state. Undoubtedly, the price of military intervention would be a high death toll, both among civilians and soldiers. Hausmann might see interventions such as the US one in Panama in 1989 as \\\"successful\\\", but the relatives of the hundreds of Panama citizens who died that winter and the tens of thousands whose homes were destroyed, might think otherwise.  Hausmann and others like him are making the case for military intervention on exaggerated portrayals of reality. Undeniably, there is hyperinflation and food and medicine shortages that are creating significant hardship for many Venezuelans, but Hausmann's comparison of Venezuela's current situation to that of Ukraine's Great Famine of the 1930s in which millions of Ukrainians were starved to death by the Soviet government, is seriously off-base.  Hausmann uses these and other hyperbolic misrepresentations (like his comparison of Venezuela to Nazi-occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands) to persuade readers that Venezuela needs a military intervention.  Hausmann also cites a New York Times __[ article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas /venezuela-children-starving.html) and a similar Wall Street Journal [piece](https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-is- starving-1493995317)\\\\xa0which use pictures of emaciated babies, combined with true reports of food shortages, to create the impression that there is a widespread famine. However, a careful reading of both articles uncovers that some of the victims are actually babies who cannot breastfeed, and therefore are reliant on infant formula for which there is a major shortage in the country.\\\\xa0  No doubt, this is a terrible tragedy, and the government should be denounced for allowing poor children (and adults) to die from lack of access to nutrition sources and medicine. Yet, what is happening in Venezuela isn't comparable to the famine in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has cut off food supplies to \\\"starve Yemen into submission,\\\" as the New York Times editorial board recently [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion /saudi-arabia-yemen-famine.html).\\\\xa0  Note that the causes of the economic crisis are complex and while the Chavista government is very much responsible for it, this is hardly a new problem or simply associated to the heterodox policies, as Hausmann [had alleged](http://nakedkeynesianism.blogspot.com/2016/06/overdose-of-heterodoxy- failed-keynesian.html) previously.  Hausmann's portrayal of Venezuela is an illustration of how influential people are pouring fuel into an already-raging fire, even though their historical analyses of Venezuela have been completely off-point. When Hugo Chavez won a referendum on whether or not he was to be dismissed in 2004, the opposition refused to accept his victory and Hausmann challenged the results in [a co- authored econometric analysis](http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~rhausma/new/blacksw%20an03.pdf).  However, the referendum was held according to one of the [most](https://www.smartmatic.com/about/) reliable\\\\xa0voting systems in the world and [certified](https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc2023.html) by Organization of the American States (OAS) and Carter Center (CC) observation teams. Hausmann challenged the results by using [unreliable US polling data](https://web.archive.org/web/20070104205049/http:/www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/16151906.htm) from Penn, Schoen & Berland (PSB), which claimed Chavez actually lost by a margin of 59 to 41 rather than won by a margin of 59 to 41 and its pre- referendum polls differed majorly from the majority of other polls.  The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) [debunked](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/venezuela_2004_09.pdf)\\\\xa0Hausmann's claims, as did a panel of US statisticians who conducted an investigation for the CC and [who found no evidence of fraud](https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/2020.pdf).  This example is still crucially relevant today. The opposition went on to boycott the 2005 National Assembly elections, citing Hausmann's paper as evidence that the referendum had been \\\"stolen\\\".  Hausmann has continued this strategy, alleging in his Project Syndicate article that Venezuela is a \\\"military dictatorship\\\" and that the government \\\"has stolen three elections in 2017 alone\\\".  In the October regional elections, there were indeed violations in [one province](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/19/venezuela-opposition-claims- evidence-tampered-vote-count.html), and despite allegations of rigging, the opposition [failed to submit](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/americas/venezuela- opposition-maduro-elections.html) any evidence of it. The opposition boycotted the July vote for National Constituent Assembly\\\\xa0and part of it decided not to run in the December mayoral elections. It is impossible to know the extent of any possible tampering, [as no opposition representatives](http://www.smartmatic.com/news/article/smartmatic-statement- on-the-recent-constituent-assembly-election-in-venezuela/) were present to audit the process, as in previous elections.   **Who fears a peaceful solution?**  Now more than ever, such domineering and flimsy analyses are dangerous as it can derail a possible peaceful solution in Venezuela. There is a possibility that ongoing negotiations will result in presidential elections acceptable to both sides.  Maduro is not popular and Venezuela remains a deeply polarised country. Yet, as economist Francisco Rodriguez, one of the world's leading experts on Venezuela's economy, [noted ](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/12/why-more- sanctions-wont-help-venezuela/)recently, the governing coalition has still been able to mobilise nearly one-third of the country's adult population to support its candidates and win.  > While there is at least some public debate over the sanctions against Iran, there is almost no discussion about Washington increasing the suffering of Venezuelans in order to overthrow its government.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   In other words, in spite of inflation of more than 1,000 percent in 2017, medicine and food shortages, and the country's worst depression in history, Venezuelans still voted for the current government. This is because they fear that the opposition, whose most prominent leaders pulled off a short-lived military coup in 2002 and immediately resorted to violence, might be worse. The Chavistas also fear political persecution if the opposition were to take power.  It is important to note that despite Hausmann's constant challenges to Venezuela's election processes, he, along with [Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald- trump-161109050153947.html) and US Senator Marco Rubio (another staunch supporter of an anti-Maduro coup) fears that a democratically-driven negotiated settlement could actually work. And if such is indeed concluded, the fallacy of their warmongering would be exposed.  Currently, there is more talk and more pressure for the US to impose further sanctions on Venezuela.\\\\xa0  But the current US financial embargo is already causing great economic hardship\\\\xa0and human suffering. The government [cannot restructure](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/04/venezuela- happening-170412114045595.html) or even roll over its debt so it has been forced to cut imports drastically. This is worsening the shortages of medicine and food, as well as deepening the economic depression.  But while there is at least some public debate over the sanctions against Iran, there is almost no discussion about Washington increasing the suffering of Venezuelans in order to overthrow its government.  This is what happens when one group of people achieves such unprecedented hegemony in the representation of a country and their narrative is unchallenged in mainstream media.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** \\\\xa0 ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Talk of military intervention in Venezuela is absurd\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/talk-military-intervention-venezuela-absurd-180220074231779.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Harare, Zimbabwe** 3 Zimbabwe's President [Emmerson Mnangagwa](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/emmerson-mnangagwa-zimbabwe- crocodile-171124062910487.html) has announced that the country will hold elections in in five months, the first poll in the southern African state since independence that does not involve former President [Robert Mugabe](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/profile-zimbabwe-president- robert-mugabe-171115054707696.html).

However, the opposition maintains that without reforms, a credible outcome is not possible.  Leading opposition party,\\\\xa0the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has called for reforms before any elections are held.  Nelson Chamisa, vice president of the MDC, told Al Jazeera that while he acknowledged Mnangagwa's statement, any announcement would have to be made through authorised channels, referring to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC).  \\\"The roadmap and timeline must be availed to all contesting parties, including MDC. It must be something that all parties agree to and not just what one person says,\\\" he said.  \\\"We must have reforms in order for those elections to be free, fair and credible in line with the constitution. Reforms are fundamental; otherwise that election can't be possible, and we can't have that,\\\" Chamisa added.  According to the constitution, Zimbabwe can hold elections between July and August, although parliament can decide to dissolve itself, triggering an early vote.  The opposition is pushing for the Electoral Act to be aligned with the constitution, which would allow postal voting and the appointment of an independent election commission.  The MDC also demands equal access to a register of voters.  During elections in 2013, the electoral commission's refusal to grant the MDC access to the electronic voter roll led to a court dispute and the MDC's boycotting of subsequent by-elections.  Since the rise of the MDC in 2000, elections in Zimbabwe have been marred by political violence as well as allegations of bias by state institutions and vote rigging.  With tensions at their peak in 2008, almost 200 opposition supporters died during the presidential poll.  The political crisis led to the MDC, the ruling Zanu-PF, and other parties forming a coalition government.       ---   [THE LISTENING POST: Zimbabwe - A look back through Mugabe's media legacy (9:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sONCcqEdXGo)     ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Zimbabwe to hold first post-Mugabe vote in summer\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/zimbabwe-hold-post-mugabe-vote-summer-180118105436862.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **England, United Kingdom -** As Myanmar's Rohingya continue to trickle into neighbouring Bangladesh, extending a six-month exodus, talk of [repatriation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/bangladesh-myanmar-set- implement-rohingya-repatriation-deal-180107110002990.html)\\\\xa0simmers at the diplomatic level.

This is not something that is happening just right now, it's been happening since 1978 when my mother was pregnant with me. I was born in Burma. My family fled to Bangladesh, and came back without any citizenship.  (Note: In 1978, Myanmar drove out \\\"illegal\\\" residents. Many Rohingya fled to Bangladesh but returned following international pressure. In 1982, Myanmar's Citizenship Law deprived the Rohingya of citizenship.)  The West knows what has been happening. There are well documented UK and US embassies in Yangon - they are all aware of what's been happening over many years to the Rohingya.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   What's been happening since August is clearly a genocide, which they knew about.  It's good to see Boris Johnson visited, but we haven't seen any significant action from the UK government to stop this genocide.   **Maung Zarni** **:** The Rohingya and Burmese Buddhists and other ethnic communities - we belong in the same country. Tun Khin's community has been singled out for, essentially, intentional destruction from its very root. This has been going on for 40 years since 1978 [and] the UN and its member states and the UK, US - they know more than enough to determine that this is a classic case of a genocide.  The problem is members states of the UN, particularly the UN Security Council. The Security Council is essentially in a coma in the case of Rohingya, in the case of Syria, in the case of Yemen.  Before this exodus, Yangon was the place every world leader and delegation went - they wanted to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, they wanted to visit her home.  Now, Burma is no longer democratising, Burma is actually going backward and moving in the fascist direction.  Now, every single iconic figure with concerns about refugees is travelling to Bangladesh. Hollywood stars, heads of states, and Boris Johnson.

French President [Macron](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/profile-emmanuel- macron-170403132712654.html) called this genocide. Boris Johnson called it industrial ethnic cleansing. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called it ethnic cleansing.  These are three major permanent UN Security Council members. You cannot describe a situation like this and then not consider very forceful options, even if the Burmese government and its neighbours are unprepared to act.

It's time to see how we can use the International Criminal Court ([ICC](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/icc.html)) to try [Myanmar military chief] Min Aung Hlaing and Aung San Suu Kyi. They joined together to commit genocide.  The Rohingya want safety and protection - so we need a UN-protected area for their return.   **Zarni:** Before we can take any action, we need to accept the reality. The reality is that Burma - the society and military and government of Aung San Suu Kyi - has shown absolutely no indication that it will accept the Rohingya as an ethnic community who deserve full and equal citizenship as well as basic human rights, like everyone else in the country.  When you have a situation where the entire society and entire military and entire political class have rejected an ethnic community, then it is dishonest for any politician and any UN official leader to keep saying they want to see voluntary safe and dignified return.  > What the Rohingya need is a piece of earth that they can call their home, where they don't need to worry about being slaughtered or their houses and villages being burned.\\\\r > > Maung Zarni, member of Myanmar's Buddhist majority > >   Return is no longer an option. If the Burmese army or Aung San Suu Kyi said they want to receive the Rohingya back, that is simply a deception to try to defuse the international attention and get the international community off its back.  What the Rohingya need is a piece of earth that they can call their home, where they don't need to worry about being slaughtered or their houses and villages being burned.  What we need to see is a small number of genuinely concerned leaders around the world to call a special conference to create an autonomous region for the Rohingya, where they can feel safe and protected by the UN and neighbouring government of Bangladesh and others. I don't think any other solution will work.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   We are not talking about [for example, the] creation of a Jewish state out of Palestine where there were already pre-existing populations that got kicked out.

The university maintains official ties with the University of Yangon, where genocidal views are espoused.  Oxford also has an exchange programme for Burmese scholars and researchers. They become more articulate and better educated and use the Oxford training to justify the genocide of the Rohingya and to cover up.  We want students to tell the Vice-Chancellor Louise Richardson to cut institutional ties with Yangon, to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of her doctorate.

Just days after it was announced that Khan - a hijab-wearing Muslim beauty blogger - \\\\xa0was to join French cosmetics company L'Oreal's \\\"diversity-celebrating\\\" haircare campaign, she was forced to pull out. Her decision followed a right-wing witch-hunt against her over past tweets condemning Israel's actions during the [war on Gaza](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/spotlight/gaza-war.html) in 2014.  In many ways, this turn of events was hardly a surprise. L'Oreal's decision to sack Munroe Bergdorf, a black trans woman model, in 2017 for denouncing white supremacy made it clear that there was no substance to its \\\"diversity\\\" campaign.  L'Oreal, like so many other international companies, has been involved in the co-optation and depoliticisation of diversity. For international companies as well as state institutions, diversity is acceptable as long as it is easily consumed, profitable, and - perhaps most importantly - silently performative.  But diversity of opinion which challenges structural racism and inequality is perceived as dangerous and therefore silenced.   **Silencing critical voices**  Khan was calling out settler colonialism; she was expressing her outrage over a state that continues to violate international law and enforce apartheid practices as it systematically discriminates against and murders Palestinians on their own land.  It is therefore striking that, while using the concept of \\\"diversity\\\" which is supposed to challenge eurocentric standards of beauty by normalising brown and black people on our screens, L'Oreal refuses to accept and be honest about the historical and political reasons for needing to do so.  Colonialism is one example of the direct and physical consequences of white supremacy, which is an ideological pillar and justification for continued racism around the world. Racism is the reason why there is a lack of diversity from the corporate boardrooms to L'Oreal'sadverts, as well as the reason why we are supposed to accept as \\\"normal\\\" or even \\\"mundane\\\", the images of Palestinians being murdered, displaced, imprisoned, and disposed.   {articleGUID}   After all, they are only Arabs, right? If white bodies were being subjected to a fraction of this sort of sustained structural violence, the Western world would erupt in outrage and intervene.  L'Oreal's actions in relation to both women go beyond ignoring or sweeping these political truths aside. They are acts of silencing women of colour who speak out about the roots of structural violence. This is because \\\"seeking diversity\\\" as a cause has become the acceptable, ahistorical and liberal alternative to anti-racism.   **When the state enforces 'equality and diversity'**  The UK context provides a great example of how diversity has been used to silence those challenging structural racism and its roots.  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, mass actions took place against the systematic injustice faced by people of colour in the UK, including the Notting Hill Riots of 1958 and the Bristol Bus Boycott of 1963. All of this led to the inception of the Race Relations Act of 1965, which eventually resulted in the development of \\\"equality and diversity\\\" departments, policies and practices across education, healthcare, policing, the judicial system, etc.  > The diversity industry is used to control and redefine the experiences of people of colour so that we don't point to institutional oppression, imperialist interventions and colonial legacies as the problem.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   For many who were on the front line of these struggles, the act was a breakthrough. The state was seen as committing to the legal obligation of not discriminating on the basis of race or ethnicity, which was supposed to allow equal opportunities and treatment for people of colour.  While there have certainly been advances, the institutionalisation of anti- racist, anti-fascist and anti-colonialist movements seems to now be working against the oppressed.  But 50 years later, one can easily see that not all went well after the state became an authority and enforcer of equality and diversity practices. Indeed, in 2016 police officers still killed, imprisoned, and harassed[ disproportionally more people of colour](https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame- deaths-in-police-custody) than whites.   {articleGUID}   Poverty, access to quality education, and discrimination in the job market are still strongly racialised. And the situation does not appear to be getting any better. In fact, the opposite is true. Behind the legalistic and institutional language of equality and diversity, power and oppression remain unchallenged.  Diversity has become a tool for silencing those who fall victim to institutional racism and vocally resist it. The \\\"diversity cause\\\" reduces the conversation to acknowledging the consequences of structural racism while ignoring its causes. Once one is explicit and critical about the very reasons why people of colour need support in the work place, or targeted mentoring and services at university, or culturally-competent mental health services, one becomes an enemy to \\\"inclusion\\\" and \\\"diversity\\\".  The punishment is exclusion, expulsion and character assassination that varies from accusations of being the aggressive \\\"angry black woman\\\" who is making white people uncomfortable for refusing to ignore daily racial abuse and microaggressions, to being \\\"the Muslim anti-Semite sympathising with terrorists\\\" who opposes imperialism and colonialism.  In reality, this problem has gone further than just watering down and depoliticising the language of liberation; equality and diversity spaces are now being used to actively criminalise dissent.  One example of this is the UK government's racist counterterrorism PReVeNT programme, meant to identify \\\"vulnerable\\\" individuals at risk of \\\"radicalisation\\\". The programme, which uses the equality and diversity departments, encourages the racial profiling of Muslims and people of colour under the guise of \\\"safeguarding\\\".  So these departments which were meant to root out racism, are now actively training their workers to do the contrary. For example, PReVeNT officers are supposed to monitor individuals expressing support for Palestine whether verbally, on social media or through protest action.  Opposing settler colonialism and expressing solidarity with [Palestine](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/palestine.html) have become a key indicator of \\\"radicalisation\\\" in the UK.   **The diversity industry**  Despite helping reinforce white supremacist capitalist patriarchy in society by directly benefiting from the exploitation and inferiorisation of brown and black people around the world, L'Oreal - like other international companies - has tried to present itself as an inclusive, peaceful entity that celebrates diversity.  Khan and Bergdorf's statements had to be cast aside and demonised as extreme and destructive to the vision of unity because they had dared to contextualise oppression, and therefore held a mirror up at L'Oreal and the industry at large exposing their silence, inaction and complicity. These women of colour went beyond what the company's agenda allowed them to say and do, so they were disciplined for it.  Bell Hooks put it best when she stated, \\\"When liberal whites fail to understand how they can and/or do embody white supremacist values and beliefs even though they may not embrace racism as prejudice or domination, they cannot recognize the ways their actions support and affirm the very structure of racist domination and oppression that they wish to see eradicated.\\\"  The diversity industry is used to control and redefine the experiences of people of colour so that we don't point to institutional oppression, imperialist interventions and colonial legacies as the problem.  It is used to suppress critical activity and accountability-seeking and support a space of superficial subjectivity to dictate the solutions to the problem of inequality.  The message of companies like L'Oreal is clear: be beautiful, sell products, and stay silent. Khan and Bergdorf - or Colin Kaepernick in the world of sports for that matter - thought otherwise.  They shouldn't back down. The struggle starts with refusal to conform. Then goes on with fighting back.   _ **The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance.\\\\xa0**_ ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How the 'diversity industry' silences people of colour\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/diversity-industry-silences-people-colour-180127131007232.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Described as \\\"the father of\\\\xa0Pinyin\\\", or Chinese phonetic language, and hailed as the man who simplified Chinese, Zhou Youguang would have been 112 this Saturday.

Modi, who is being accompanied by the finance and commerce ministers, was scheduled to host a dinner for global industry bosses from 18 countries on\\\\xa0Monday night, according to the Indian Express newspaper.   Worsening inequality  Overall global inequality figures further worsened according to the Oxfam report, with the richest one percent cornering 82 percent of the wealth created last year.  Activists and development economists are worried at the accumulation of wealth in the hands of the rich in India. Last year, 58 percent of national income went to India's richest one percent.  \\\"It is a direct result of these neo-liberal policies whose modus operandi is to pamper the rich in the name of achieving higher growth,\\\" Prabhat Patnaik, professor emeritus at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University, told Al Jazeera.       ---   [COUNTING THE COST: The challenge of economic inequality (25:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgxZzwzL_Nk)        \\\"But the growth that occurs is accompanied by the absolute impoverishment of large numbers. Such inequalities undermine the foundations of modern India and its survival as a secular democratic republic.\\\"  Oxfam said the figures suggest that \\\"approximately two-thirds of billionaire wealth is the product of inheritance, monopoly and cronyism\\\".  The report, Reward Work Not Wealth, blames the race to the bottom between countries on tax and on wages as a top contributor to deepening inequality, along with the crushing of workers' rights.  \\\"It would take around 17.5 days for the best-paid executive at a top Indian garment company to earn what a minimum wage worker in rural India will earn in their lifetime (presuming 50 years at work),\\\" Oxfam said.   Falling short  Since taking office in 2014, the Modi government has announced schemes to increase spending on infrastructure, including ports and roads, to boost economic growth.  But it has fared poorly in combating poverty, say critics.  \\\"The Indian government 9s efforts at reducing inequality and combating poverty faster are woefully inadequate. It needs to stop the super-rich and the corporates from continuing to rob India of its wealth,\\\" Nisha Agrawal, CEO of Oxfam India, told Al Jazeera.  The government needs to \\\"invest more in agriculture; and implementing fully the social protection schemes (such as rural job scheme and the Food Security Act) that already exist.\\\"       ---   [COUNTING THE COST: Higher retirement age vs lower pensions (06:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48FnJGoqEI)      India's wealth inequality also contributes to lack of access to quality medical care for the poor.  Those living on $2 a day have a mortality rate three times the global average, according to the Oxfam report.  \\\"Healthcare spending during accidents or emergencies for low-income households often means a reduction in the consumption of food or other basic needs that can push people below the extreme poverty line,\\\" the report warns.  India's health budget is at 1.15 percent of the country's GDP, one of the lowest proportions in the world.  Oxfam India on Monday urged Modi to tax the super-rich and ensure that the Indian economy \\\"works for everyone and not just the fortunate few\\\".  In an online survey conducted by Oxfam, 73 percent Indians said they wanted \\\"the gap between the rich and poor to be addressed very urgently\\\".   Global wealth databook  In the survey with a sample size of 11,000 Indians, a majority of respondents said CEOs should accept pay cuts up to 60 percent.  Oxfam said it used calculations to compare returns to shareholders and CEO compensation with returns to ordinary workers for its analysis.  It used data from Credit Suisse's annual Global Wealth Databook and the Forbes billionaires list.  India lifted 120 million people from extreme poverty between 1990 and 2013, according to the [World Bank](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations /world-bank.html). However, one out of two Indians remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty, it says.  India's march to reducing poverty has been significantly slower compared to neighbouring China. Over the same 1990-2013 period, China reduced the number of people living in extreme poverty from 756 million to 25 million.  \\\"The message in the Oxfam report is not new.

Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, a human rights activist based in Colombo, asked \\\"why there is any interest in 2018 to impose on women laws that don't apply to men\\\".  \\\"It is patriarchy at its best, implying that women are unfit to make decisions for themselves,\\\" she said.

These developments take place ahead of crucial local elections scheduled to take place next month under a new voting system that combines both the first past the post and proportional representation systems.  The new electoral method also makes it mandatory for the first time that all parties include at least 25 percent women on their list of nominated candidates.  The mayoral candidate of the United National Party (UNP) - the coalition partner of Sirisena 9s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) - for Colombo is a woman.  Sri Lanka's social media landscape is predominantly occupied by urban populations who are more sensitive to gender issues, but the majority of the president's desired voter base are rural Sinhalese Buddhists who reside outside of Colombo.  \\\"The president will not be unpopular because of these specific decisions across the country, possibly as a reflection of the fact that sensitivity to gender issues is not felt right across the country as it is felt in major cities like Colombo,\\\" Kalana Senaratne, a senior lecturer at the Department of Law, University of Peradeniya, said.   'Consolidating Buddhist values'  Kalana asserted that this electoral demographic would be inclined to see these acts pertaining to alcohol as the president \\\"consolidating Buddhist values\\\".  A World Health Organization report [shows](http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msb_gsr_2014_2.pdf?ua=1) that of Sri Lankans above the age of 15, 80 percent of women were lifetime teetotallers in comparison to men, of whom 56 percent were lifetime abstainers.

The president's moves preceded by days an incident where a 14-year-old girl from Tissamaharama, a southern town, died in hospital after she attempted suicide after allegedly being raped by three youths.  Many feel that the existential issue to do with female inequality has now been reduced in the public imagination to a single issue, the inability to buy alcohol.  \\\"Many of those who took to social media have focussed solely on this issue without using this as a platform to highlight the larger issues facing women in Sri Lanka, eg the gender pay gap, inability for women to rise up to board level, and being looked at negatively when it comes to recruitment among many other issues,\\\" said Selyna Pieris, a lawyer and director of a handloom company.  \\\"A frivolous, dormant law got significantly more publicity in local and international media than these larger issues,\\\" said Selyna whose company has hired more than a thousand women.  \\\"And as a collective, I feel like we missed a big opportunity to highlight other more pertinent discriminatory issues faced by Sri Lankan women.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Sri Lanka's flip-flop on women alcohol ban slammed\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/sri-lanka-flip-flop-women-alcohol-ban-assailed-180117122249767.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Traces of human presence dating back some 1,000-1,200 years have been found in the world's largest coastal mangrove forest in southwest [Bangladesh](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bangladesh.html), according to local and foreign researchers.

These findings were revealed by a local independent researcher, Ism Azam.   New Chapter\\\\xa0  Sufi Mostafizur Rahman, an archaeologist at Jahangirnagar University and executive director of Oitihya Onneswan (Explore the Heritage), an archaeological research group, told Anadolu news agency that this discovery adds a new chapter to the history of Bangladesh.  \\\"If a deeper study of those structures is done, we may uncover many facts about the Sundarbans and the history of this land.  \\\"More in-depth research is needed to determine how long and exactly when they were here,\\\" he added.  Comilla University archaeologist Shohrab Uddin, also at Oitihya Onneswan, said the discovery will add a new dimension to the Sundarbans' history.  \\\"Due to the remoteness of the forests of the southern region of Bangladesh, the history of the Sundarbans is quite unknown, but this discovery by Ism Azam opens the door to new possibilities,\\\" he added.    Sundarbans  By observing the structures and analyzing the styles, Rahman estimated the age of the site at 1,000-1,200 years, around the time of [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/India.html)'s Pala Empire, from the 8th-12th century, or possibly even older.  Although the structures seem geared towards trade and handicrafts, he believes there were also living areas.  In the remote areas of the Sundarbans, Ism Azam travelled for seven years to do a count of the local tigers.  While working in the forest, he came across ruins of clearly man-made materials.  When the top layer of the soil was wiped away, the foundations of long-lost structures emerged before his eyes.  \\\"I found this archaeological site in 2015. Since then, I've found some pottery, ceramics, and various utensils.  \\\"Then I tried to come up with an explanation. I don't have any academic training in this subject. Finally, I got a chance to talk to archaeologists on February 25 and they came to visit this site and recognized it.\\\"  The largest structures were discovered in the Khajuradana, Arpangasiya, and Shekhertake areas, while other structures were found at the Khol Patua river bank, Katka, and on the coast of the Bay of Bengal.  Asked if the tool and brick styles can help determine the age, Uddin said there were human settlements in different eras working to produce salt and engage in trade, but natural disasters and enemy invasions caused them to periodically collapse.   Salt production  Uddin recently worked with a team from Germany's Bremen University in Bangladesh to explore the geological structure and characteristics of the Sundarbans area.  He said they found some ancient salt-making furnaces and utensils in the Katka area of the Sundarbans.  The German researchers examined carbon and other signs to determine the area's age. In that study, Humayun Akhter, a professor of geology at Dhaka University, led the Bangladesh section.  According to his research, they found three salt production facilities in the Sundarbans' Katka area. One of them was 250-300 years old, another was 600 years old, and the third was the most ancient, 1,000 years old.  The researchers found a mound in Katka called Tiger Hill. There, they found signs of water purification and drainage - signs that, at that time, the local people used advanced technology. From 250 to 1,000 years ago, the people of the Sundarbans produced salt and exported it to East Asia and [Europe](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html).  The Sundarbans is a vast forest in the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal and is considered one of the natural wonders of the world.

For a decade, the artefacts underwent an arduous $3m restoration process. Preserved, catalogued and digitised, some pieces were put on display in a touring exhibit that has gone across the US.  At the exhibit's last stop at the Jewish Museum of Maryland this month, visitors could see \\\"tiks\\\" (cases for Torah scrolls) shaped like minaret towers, a testament to Iraq's architecture; a Hebrew Bible from 1568; and a Haggadah (Passover guide), hand-written and decorated by an Iraqi youth.  Washington had assured the Iraqis the archive would be repatriated after the restoration process was done. But after pushing back the return date several times, the relics are still here.  US officials now say they are slated to be sent back in September 2018.   Rich history  The personal pictures and letters found in the archive paint a vivid picture of a well-integrated community whose members held prominent positions in government and commerce and excelled in the world of arts.  Hit songs such as Foug el-Nakhal by Iraqi-Jewish composers Saleh and Daoud al- Kuwaiti remain popular across the Arab world. Sassoon Eskell, a legislator, minister and financier, is still remembered fondly as one of the architects of modern-day Iraq.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/22/0a3e8ca42940497491e971256b5895d1_18.jpg)  ---  Iraq's Jewish population once numbered about 130,000 people [Dalia Hatuqa/Al Jazeera]     In 1910, records show Jews living in Baghdad made up one-quarter of the city's overall population.  By 1949, Iraq's Jewish population totalled about 130,000 people, mostly living in Baghdad, but also in Basra and Mosul.  Many documents capture snippets of their communal life: a letter details the allocation of sheep during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, while another asks the community's patriarch to persuade a man to grant his wife a \\\"Get\\\" (religious divorce).  \\\"The archive talks about public life ... and most of the period it covers is the interwar period [between the two world wars] and the 1950s and 60s of Iraqi Jews who didn't migrate to Israel and lived in Iraq,\\\" said Bashkin.  \\\"And you see the degree of Arabisation of the Iraqi Jewish community,\\\" she told Al Jazeera.  \\\"It shows you that you could be an Iraqi and a Jew and that there's not an inherent contradiction there, and it shows you can be an Arab Jew.\\\"   Repatriating the collection  But in the US, legislators and Jewish and pro-Israel groups say the archive should be conserved in a more stable environment where the descendants of Iraqi Jews can access them. They have\\\\xa0been lobbying to keep the collection from being repatriated to Baghdad.  In 2014, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution urging the Obama administration to come to a different agreement with Iraqi officials.  Charles Schumer, the\\\\xa0Senate minority leader,\\\\xa0asked the Department of State\\\\xa0in October 2017\\\\xa0not to send the archive back and instead find a location that's more accessible to Iraqi Jews and their descendants.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/22/4debfe714f1c4c38ac347cf53031ceeb_18.jpg)  ---  Iraq's ancient Jewish community was well-integrated in the country\\\\xa0[Dalia Hatuqa/Al Jazeera]     Groups such as the Zionist Organization of America have made similar arguments, as have members of the Israeli parliament who have been pushing Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/01/201311113412274889.html) to pressure the US to back out of its commitment to Iraqi authorities.  \\\"It's pretty clear that a lot of artefacts didn't reach the West in a very ethical way,\\\" said Assaf Shalev, an Israeli-American journalist whose paternal family hails from Baghdad.  \\\"It's very clear that the US holding on to it would activate [the] sensitiveness around Third World countries getting their cultural heritage stolen,\\\" he said, adding he saw the other side of the repatriation debate as well.  \\\"If this collection goes to Iraq, Iraqi Jews won't have access to it for the most part. I'm not sure where I fall exactly. I see merits in both arguments,\\\"\\\\xa0Shalev said.   Painful memories  When [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html) was established in 1948, it began to push for Iraqi Jews to immigrate to the newly established state.\\\\xa0Many in the community believe that several explosions targeting them in Baghdad were instigated by Israeli operatives or local Zionist groups to hasten their exodus.  This was coupled with a right-wing campaign inside Iraq against Jewish people that was spurred by ultra-nationalists who conflated Zionism and Judaism, as well as a government crackdown on the communist party where many young Iraqi Jews were active.  In 1950 and 1951, about 90 percent of the Jewish population left Iraq with most families moving to Israel, US-based historian Michael Fischbach [estimates](http://www.merip.org/mer/mer248/claiming-jewish-communal-property- iraq).  Many Iraqi Jews faced discrimination once they arrived in Israel, however, and they were not given proper work or education opportunities, said\\\\xa0Yael Ben Yefet, director of HaKeshet HaDemocratit HaMizrahit (the Democratic Mizrahi Rainbow), a social justice coalition of Middle Eastern Jews in Israel.  Ben Yefet said most of the Iraqis in Israel today would be unable to see the archive if it remains in the US because of \\\"the educational and social- economic status of Iraqi Jews\\\", which has declined from one generation to the next.  \\\"On a personal level, and if I want my mother to be able to see [the archive], I'd like it to come to Israel or to a place where Iraqi Jews can have access to it,\\\" she said.   {articleGUID}   A recent idea has been to permanently house the archive in Iraq, but allow it to tour museums that are accessible to Jewish communities worldwide.  That's a proposal that Ben Yefet said she supports.  In the meantime, Bashkin said the collection remains close to the hearts of many Iraqi Jewish families, for whom it also raises painful memories.  Those include the Farhud - a 1941 pogrom that claimed the lives of 180 members of the community and ended in mass looting of their property - and the killing of 40 Iraqi Jews in 1968 when the Baath party came to power.  \\\"These traumatic memories are often projected onto the archive,\\\" Bashkin said.  \\\"They know they can't go back to Iraq and they do want access to it.

In Tsvangirai's place, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) installed on Thursday Nelson Chamisa as its acting president for 12 months.  This means the 40-year old is expected to be the party's presidential candidate when elections take place later in 2018.  Chamisa told supporters gathered at the MDC's headquarters in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, that he was confident of a successful campaign, despite the death of a party \\\"icon\\\".  \\\"We have lost a doyen of democracy,\\\" Chamisa said.  \\\"We are just four months away from an election and we have lost a commander but what I can tell you is that we do not have a [leadership] crisis ... We will win this election.\\\"  A powerful public speaker that led the opposition for nearly two decades, Tsvangirai, 65, passed away on Wednesday after a protracted battle with colon cancer.  His death came fewer than 90 days after Emmerson Mnangagwa's elevation to Zimbabwe's presidency and, crucially, within \\\"four to five\\\" months of an expected national election.  Mnangagwa, the leader of the ruling [ZANU- PF](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/zanu-pf.html) party, was sworn in as president in November 2017 following the forced resignation of former ally and long-time ruler Robert Mugabe, who had been in power since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.  The changes, profound and sudden, have reshaped the political landscape in Zimbabwe, Alex Magaisa, a Zimbabwean academic and former adviser to Tsvangirai, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"The next election will be new compared to previous votes in the last 20 years because the two most important characters, Tsvangirai and Mugabe, won't be on the ballot paper,\\\" Magaisa said.  \\\"We are entering uncharted territory.\\\"   **New leadership**  A former chairperson of the MDC Youth Assembly, Chamisa is widely seen as one of the brightest stars within his party.  But outside of MDC circles, he is one of many who have been overshadowed by\\\\xa0Tsvangirai's\\\\xa0towering figure, according to Sue Onslow, a specialist in African history at The Institute of Commonwealth Studies in London.  \\\"The problem in terms of the visibility of the MDC going into this year's elections is that Morgan Tsvangirai genuinely had the national profile - and his successors do not in anything like the same way,\\\" she told Al Jazeera.  \\\"They have lost someone who was an enormously courageous man, the figurehead in opposing a one-party state structure.\\\"  In comparison, the ZANU-PF party appears to be attempting to broaden its appeal under Mnangagwa, who has pledged to deliver a series of economic reforms to turn around Zimbabwe's ailing economy and fight corruption.  Approximately 2.3 million Zimbabweans live in extreme poverty, according to [the World Bank](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/333081497536246610/pdf/116309 -WP-PUBLIC-on-6-21-6-am-dc- time-15-6-2017-15-24-30-ZimbabweEconomicUpdate.pdf), around 14 percent of the country's total population.  Chamisa could, however, have a significant advantage on the campaign trail.  \\\"He's youthful, and therefore has a massive appeal with young people,\\\" Magaisa said, noting that Chamisa is 35 years younger than Mnangagwa, his main opponent.  \\\"He's also quite charismatic, and has the ability to connect with ordinary people much in the same way as Morgan [Tsvangirai].\\\"   **The loss of a founding father**  With a ballot on the horizon, the MDC has little time to manage the transition as it faces up to the challenge of prizing votes and overturning 37 years of ZANU-PF rule.  It will be a tall order, said Michael Bratton, a professor of political science and African studies at Michigan State University.  \\\"Tsvangirai was a unifying factor and the only charismatic leader who could carry the opposition to an electoral victory, as he did in 2008 - even though he was cheated out of it,\\\" he told Al Jazeera.  Tsvangirai topped the first round of a March 2008 presidential election, winning 47.8 percent of the vote compared with Mugabe's 43.2 percent share, according to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission.  However, after failing to win the absolute majority required to assume the presidency, Tsvangirai withdrew from a second ballot in June saying Mugabe had sanctioned security forces to intimidate opponents and influence the vote, leaving Mugabe to win a one-horse race.  According to\\\\xa0[Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2010/02/abuse-human- rights-zimbabwe-continues-under-unity-government-20100210/),\\\\xa0at least 200 people were killed, more than 9,000 injured and tens of thousands displaced by government forces in fewer than four months between the two polls.\\\\xa0   **A 'party divided'**  A week before his death, Tsvangirai, who founded the MDC in 1999, reportedly appointed Chamisa as the party's acting president.  Chamisa was one of three party vice-presidents under Tsvangirai, alongside Elias Mudzuri and Thokozani Khupe.  Both Khupe and Mudzuri have been openly critical of Chamisa in recent days. They also did not attend MDC's meeting on Thursday, amid speculation over a potential split.  \\\"The manner in which the succession issue has been handled is claimed to have left the party divided,\\\" Magaisa said.  \\\"There is an impression that it's almost as if a power grab has taken place, because there are three factions in the party led by the three [former] vice- presidents.\\\"  Tsvangirai's death has revealed, rather than caused, the now apparent party divides, according to Bratton, the university professor.  \\\"The opposition was already, prior to Tsvangirai's death, in a weaker state than it had been for a long time and due to his death it will become even more fragmented,\\\" he said.  Onslow agreed, saying such a scenario would pose an immediate threat to the MDC's chance of winning the upcoming elections.  \\\"I don't see the opposition getting its house in order, in order to fight a coherent and cohesive campaign,\\\" she added.  The MDC's efforts may also be hampered by a shortage of funds and weaker grassroots organisation compared with a resurgent ZANU-PF, according to Onslow.  \\\"We focus too much on a binary political landscape in Zimbabwe, [but] it's not that - ZANU-PF is dominant,\\\" she said.  ZANU-PF currently holds 57 of 80 seats in Zimbabwe's Senate, and 160 of 210 seats in the country's lower chamber, the House of Assembly.   **A chance to challenge**  But, according to Magaisa, the MDC may yet prove capable of electoral victory, taking advantage of widespread grievances over the state of Zimbabwe's economy and challenges over providing basic services.  The [United Nations Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI) \\\\- which measures health, education and economic performance - ranks Zimbabwe 154th out of 188 countries, placing it in the lowest category of development.  In order to deliver change, the MDC must first win the election by retaining its core supporters - previously bounded by Tsvangirai's leadership - and galvanising support among Zimbabwe's youth, Magaisa said.  \\\"The MDC is still a force to be reckoned with \\\\u2026 I don't think it will be a walk over for Mnangagwa,\\\" he added, arguing that ZANU-PF's popularity \\\"is being exaggerated\\\".  \\\"There is a lot of hatred over \\\\u2026 what [ZANU-PF] has done over the years, people have not forgotten that.  \\\"Especially if people are free to vote the way that they want, ZANU-PF may be in for a big surprise.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Zimbabwe: What's next for MDC after Morgan Tsvangirai?\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/zimbabwe-mdc-morgan-tsvangirai-180216135902399.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Puerto Princesa, the Philippines -\\\\xa0** Angela was just 14 the first time she got pregnant.

Dennis Socrates, Palawan's vice governor and former mayor of Puerto Princesa   ---    Socrates, a member of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, is vehemently opposed to all forms of artificial contraception and even some natural ones.  \\\"Even withdrawal is an immoral means for preventing birth because there's an active, a positive act to prevent the outcome which is the natural consequence of the marital act,\\\" Socrates says. \\\"All human life is good, even life that is helpless, even life that belongs to a poor family, even human life that isn't wanted by the mother.\\\"  When Socrates was mayor of Puerto Princesa in the early 2000s, he stopped the funding for contraceptives distributed through public health centres.  \\\"We declared Puerto Princesa city a pro-life, pro-family city which is really a harmless thing and I simply refused to allocate funds, specifically to buy contraceptives,\\\" he says.

This includes legislation that several Republican and Democratic Congress members have sponsored to curb the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which aims to pressure Israel into ending its occupation of Arab and Palestinian land.  AIPAC set the stage for its conference, which runs from Sunday through Tuesday and features leaders of both parties, by sending out an \\\"action alert\\\" to rally support for two anti-boycott bills in the House and Senate.  \\\"Israel has long been targeted by the pernicious Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Together we must continue the fight to protect Israel from economic warfare and American companies legally doing business with the Jewish state,\\\" the alert said.  \\\"The United Nations and other international governmental organisations have long singled out Israel with unfair criticism and have led efforts to isolate the Jewish state politically and economically.\\\"   {articleGUID}   An AIPAC official told the\\\\xa0[Jewish Telegraph Agency](https://www.jta.org/2018/02/28/news-opinion/the-telegraph/six-things- watch-aipac-policy-conference)\\\\xa0that conference talking points would include its backing of two bills targeting BDS, with a focus on a UN database of companies that deal with [Israeli settlements](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/50-years-illegal- settlements/index.html).  The bills were initially backed by both parties but its sponsors have found themselves in hot water following criticism by civil liberty groups, leading some Democrats to withhold support.  Free-speech advocates and various activist groups have been fighting these bills in court and through grassroots organising, arguing that boycott is a protected means of political expression under the First Amendment.  \\\"Politicians are increasingly out of touch with the grassroots in this country, on many issues, including Palestinian rights,\\\" said Rahul Saksena, a lawyer at Palestine Legal, a group that supports pro-Palestine civil rights activists.  \\\"While more and more people support boycotts for Palestinian rights, legislators continue to enact unconstitutional anti-boycott laws.\\\"  BDS opponents have recently been dealt a series of setbacks, most notably the declaration by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last month that it had identified more than 200 businesses, 22 of them American, that could be held accountable for operating in settlements.  The [UN](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html) did not release that database of firms, and it is unclear if it ever will, experts say, but that has not slowed momentum to pass legislation that civil liberty advocates believe stifles freedom of expression by erasing the distinction between Israel and its settlements.  \\\"We have seen a wave of legislation in US states and efforts at the federal level ... to define any differentiation between the two as boycotting Israel and to seek ways to use US law to either sanction people doing that to punish them or to prevent them from doing it,\\\" said Lara Friedman, president of the Washington, DC-based Foundation for Middle East Peace.   Israel Anti-Boycott Act  The non-profit found that as of March 1,[\\\\xa0](http://fmep.org/wp/wp- content/uploads/State-BDS-and-Settlement-legislation-table.pdf)[23 states](http://fmep.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/State-BDS-and-Settlement- legislation-table.pdf) enacted laws or executive orders to withhold contracts from companies and individuals that boycott either Israel or its settlements, essentially conflating the two.  At the federal level, Congress is pushing forward with a bill called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would impose criminal penalties - up to $1m fine and 20 years in prison - on those supporting, promoting or providing information that champions efforts to boycott Israel, including its settlements.  The bill's main sponsors, who will be speaking at the AIPAC conference,\\\\xa0argue that they are merely updating long-standing, anti-boycott legislation, which dates back to the 1970s and were written to address the Arab League boycott of Israel.\\\\xa0They deny that the bill would target US individuals or involve criminal or civil penalties.  Critics, such as Friedman, argue that under the bill's provisions, researchers or activists could be found legally liable for producing information on Israeli settlements based on the UN database or the EU's differentiation strategy, which requires excluding settlement activities from its bilateral relations with Israel.  This week, AIPAC will also be lobbying for the Combating BDS Act, a bill designed to give a federal green light to the 23 states with laws to combat BDS efforts. Friedman calls these state bills \\\"gag laws\\\" and free-speech advocates like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have challenged the constitutionality of some of these bills, leading to a major victory for the BDS movement in Kansas.  In January, a federal judge [issued a temporary injunction](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/kansas-judge-temporarily- suspends-anti-bds-law-180130181725634.html) on a Kansas law requiring US individuals and companies to sign a declaration that they will not engage in a boycott of Israel if they want to be awarded a state contract.  But other states seem undeterred by the Kansas ruling, forging through local legislatures to introduce similar bills, or expanding existing laws on the issue.  \\\"We've seen laws like this introduced across the country,\\\" said Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of the Arizona chapter of the Council on American- Islamic Relations (CAIR).  \\\"Some cities are implementing these laws in their contracts as well, which is extremely troubling.  \\\"This happened with a mosque that was renting out the Phoenix Convention Center last year for Eid prayers. The language was eventually removed from the contract after the mosque complained.\\\"   Lawsuit filed  On Friday, CAIR and representatives of the Muslim Students Association at Arizona State University filed a lawsuit challenging the Arizona statute requiring contractors to certify that they are not engaging in BDS activity.  The university has accordingly been prohibiting groups from inviting speakers to campus who support or are affiliated with the boycott movement.   {articleGUID}   This included Hatem Bazian, a professor of Islamic law and cofounder of Zaytuna, the first-accredited Muslim college in the US.  Bazian and the AMP plaintiffs argue that the law is a violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.  \\\"What they are doing essentially is policing thought,\\\" CAIR's Siddiqi said.  \\\"They are making it illegal to espouse pro-Palestine advocacy.\\\"  On February 8, several organisations supporting Israel filed an amicus brief - documents presented usually by a group or party that back or oppose a certain outcome in a case - in federal court to uphold the Arizona anti-boycott law, calling Israel boycott efforts discriminatory.  But civil liberty groups like Palestine Legal argue that these laws are tools to crush a human rights movement and shield Israel from criticism for its violations in the Palestinian territories.  \\\"AIPAC and other Israel advocacy organisations are resorting to efforts aimed at shutting down the conversation by punishing those who speak out in support of Palestinian freedom, censoring our speech, and infringing on our constitutional right to boycott,\\\" said Saksena of Palestine Legal.  \\\"These anti-democratic tactics should have no place in a democracy.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Anti-BDS bills expected to feature prominently at AIPAC\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/anti-bds-bills-expected-feature-prominently-aipac-180303061326447.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Bethlehem, occupied West Bank -** Palestinians living in refugee camps have expressed deep alarm over [US](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country /united-states.html) threats to potentially cut funding for a relief agency tasked with providing aid and services to them.

After landing in Johannesburg, he laid a wreath at Freedom Park before driving to the University of Witwatersrand to make a speech.  At that point, he'd been the leader of the Irish nationalist party, Sinn Fein, for 22 years. It was a party [Nelson Mandela](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/nelson-mandela-nation- father-20126254044646548.html) described as \\\"an old friend and ally\\\", and this was one of several visits to South Africa by Gerry Adams that aimed to burnish his moral credentials as a peacemaker.  Waiting at the university was a BBC journalist who had scheduled an interview with the politician, and was struggling to find an interesting angle on a story about a man made famous in a conflict that had long since ceased to be \\\"top of the bulletin\\\"\\\\xa0material.  The interview started politely as Adams related his time in South Africa, and then the BBC journalist changed tack. Pointing to the African National Congress' (ANC)\\\\xa0largely peaceful overthrow of the apartheid regime, he asked Adams if he felt Mandela's party enjoyed a kind of moral legitimacy that Sinn Fein never would.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/2af8c6073e334a8fa49b5e130de87cf8_18.jpg)  ---  South African President Nelson Mandela meets with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in 1995 at the African National Congress headquarters in Johannesburg [Juda Ngwenya/Reuters]     He was, of course, referring to Sinn Fein being the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), an organisation responsible for killing more than 1,700 people.  It was an abrupt and unwelcome confrontation between two sides of Adams' persona, two epochs of his life: the defender of violence, and the man of peace. The politician responded by suggesting bias on the part of the BBC; the interview went cold, ended awkwardly, and was never broadcast.  Adams will soon step down as leader of Sinn Fein after 35 years at the helm. In that time, he has catapulted the party out of political obscurity.  Last year, Sinn Fein came within one seat of shredding the domination of pro- British political parties in Northern Ireland, a feat that could very well have resulted in a referendum on ending British rule there.  This success was built on the back of a negotiated settlement that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, a settlement in which Gerry Adams played a large part. As political resumes go, it's an impressive one.   A 'significant' figure  Former IRA man Tommy McKearney is not a cheerleader for Adams. Nonetheless, he describes him as \\\"one of the most significant major figures in Irish political life over the last 40 years, whether one likes or dislikes him\\\".  Adams' significance comes from him having persuaded the IRA to give up the use of armed force and to replace it with constitutional politics to achieve a united Ireland. This is a point even his unionist opponents acknowledge.  Ben Lowry, deputy editor of the Northern Irish unionist daily newspaper, the News Letter, says: \\\"He definitely steered the IRA, over a long period of time from the early 1980s until the late 1990s, away from violence.\\\"  Born into a poor family in west Belfast in 1948, Adams became involved in nationalist politics in the 1960s.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/79ca2363265a491aacacd03b1ea92679_18.jpg)  ---  Gerry Adams with Christy Burke, Sinn Fein's candidate in Dublin Central, in 1983 [Independent News and Media/Getty Images]     By his early adolescence, Northern Ireland had been run for 40 years by the Ulster Unionists, pro-British and almost entirely Protestant.  Injustices against Catholics, including discrimination in the allocation of housing and unequal voting rights, gave rise to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. Adams signed up to the organisation in 1967.  Two years later, a cocktail of political turmoil pushed this small region of the UK, containing just 1.5 million people, over a cliff.  Sectarian rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Belfast and Londonderry prompted a plea from the government for British troops on the ground. The troops were at first welcomed by Irish nationalists and Catholics as protectors, but quickly became the target of IRA gunmen, who saw them as illegitimate enforcers of British occupation.  The decades-long conflict that followed saw the Provisional IRA emerge as a deadly force that killed thousands of policemen, soldiers and civilians, as well as senior figures in the British government, almost claiming the life of Prime Minister [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2013/04/20134814012127352.html).   Deadly hunger strikes  Gerry Adams spent the 1970s being variously interned and arrested for alleged IRA activity but has always denied being a member.  It was the events of 1981 that gave rise to his political career.  That was the year that 10 IRA prisoners starved themselves to death, using a hunger strike to demand political status that the British government refused to grant.  The outpouring of emotion that followed encouraged the Sinn Fein leadership to seek an electoral mandate that would back up their claims of widespread support for British withdrawal and Irish unification.  They would proceed, in the words of one activist, \\\"with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other\\\".\\\\xa0   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/2/8/dd04213287b14b79b441b92189861187_18.jpg)  ---  Martin McGuiness and Gerry Adams pictured in 1985 [Independent News And Media/Getty Images]     Adams took over the leadership in 1983 and put that strategy into action.  McKearney was one of those who participated in a lesser known hunger strike in 1980.  Adams, he says, did not conceive of the strategy independently, but cultivated it and persuaded others.  \\\"The argument was being made through the 80s that there had to be an alternative,\\\" he says. \\\"The IRA, Sinn Fein and the republican movement, in general, has a political objective, and decisions were made pragmatically and rationally about how best to advance that political agenda.  \\\"Once it was deemed important to defend that position with arms and then the decision was taken to move away from arms, it wasn't useful any longer, and the movement was persuaded of that by Gerry and others.\\\"  What began as a dual strategy evolved over the course of the 1980s into a view among many in Sinn Fein that continued violence was pointless.  Some of this was likely motivated by the very successful efforts of British intelligence to undermine the IRA through a network of informers.  McKearney does not refer to this, but does describe the British state as a \\\"very strong and determined enemy\\\", and admits that \\\"some options were closed down and others opened up\\\".  Something of a window of opportunity for peace negotiations was opened in the 1990s. By the end of that decade, Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness had persuaded their party to enter into an agreement that would eventually see the IRA end its armed campaign and decommission its weapons in return for the release of prisoners and political representation in the government of Northern Ireland.  Gerry Adams, a man whose voice had been banned on British television four years earlier, now occupied an office in Stormont, formerly the seat of unionist power.  But observers point to a contradiction in that success. How, they ask, could Adams have so successfully controlled a notorious paramilitary group of which he has consistently denied ever being a member?  Since the peace agreement in 1998, Adams has been plagued by accusations from unionists and nationalists alike that he not only joined but helped to lead the IRA in the worst years of Northern Ireland's violence.  In 2014 he was questioned for four days by Northern Irish police in connection with the 1972 murder of a single mother of 10 children. He was released without charge.   'He can't tell the truth from lies'  There are those who excoriate Adams' record, and among them is former IRA member Shane Paul O'Doherty. Since spending a decade and a half in jail for his part in a letter-bombing campaign, O'Doherty has renounced violence entirely.  He calls Adams a \\\"strategist, full of charisma, a great cult leader, he has people who will follow him to hell\\\", but, he says, \\\"at this stage in his career [he] can't tell truth from lies\\\".  Editor Lowry says: \\\"Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community\\\".  Adams' characteristic opacity has fuelled speculation over his past. He is, says Lowry, \\\"mysterious, hard to read, inscrutable\\\". For unionists, that's disconcerting, especially since Adams is a man who gets results; for those who support him, it breeds respect.  > Because of the violence, and the horrors that happened, and although he denies having been in the IRA, he'll never be forgiven by the unionist community.\\\\r > > Ben Lowry, News Letter\\\\xa0deputy editor > >   Even in the twilight years of his political career, Adams has continued to evolve and grow in stature.  He gave up his place in Northern Ireland's assembly to campaign for and win a seat in the Dail - the elected legislature of the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein is now the third largest political force in the Republic.  The party's future lies in consolidating its position on both sides of the Irish border; a future bought for it by the leadership of Gerry Adams.\\\\xa0  Most commentators believe Adams will remain an essential figure to his party behind the scenes, inhabiting a perhaps familiar position, in the shadows. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Gerry Adams: A significant figure or cult leader?\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/gerry-adams-significant-figure-cult-leader-180208105453734.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ The photo of [16-year-old Fawzi al- Junaidi](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/denied-care-fawzi-al-junaidi- bail-171228112951874.html) blindfolded, bruised and surrounded by a dozen Israeli soldiers went viral on social media. It was touted as the emblem of Israeli oppression.  But for Western mainstream media, it was difficult to accommodate this photo, amid all the talk about \\\"anger\\\", \\\"rage\\\", \\\"violence\\\", and the regularly recycled imagery of burning tyres and young men with hidden faces hurling stones.  Fawzi's arrest was presented as a singular case, an exception, and what happened to him after the photo was snapped did not interest mainstream media. There was little mention of the thousands of children currently imprisoned or the fact that they are the fifth generation of Palestinians living under a military occupation.  Likewise, while many foreign correspondents were saying that US President Donald Trump's [decision](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump- transcript-full-jerusalem-israel-capital-171208093555029.html)\\\\xa0to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel had thrown \\\"[gasoline in the fire](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/15/middleeast/jerusalem-protests-friday- intl/index.html)\\\", there was little mention of the fact that that same city has been systematically ethnically cleansed for the past 70 years.  In Western mainstream reporting, Palestinians yet again were presented as irrational \\\"angry\\\" actors, their oppression yet again denied the coverage it deserves.  Palestinians usually make it into mainstream coverage only when they are protesting or physically confronting Israeli aggression.

The general media narrative will have you believe that Gilo, the Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem, and other [illegal colonies](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/50-years-illegal- settlements/index.html) in Palestine are simply \\\"[neighbourhoods](https://www.voanews.com/a/jewish-neighborhood-becomes- flashpoint-in-israeli-palestinian-conflict-71105292/415838.html)\\\" and that the West Bank is not occupied, but \\\"contested\\\" or \\\"disputed\\\".

The West Bank is where Palestinians \\\"[seek to establish a state](http://www.dw.com/en /arab-league-backs-plan-to-seek-palestinian-statehood-in-un-security- council/a-18101896)\\\" rather than a territory that belongs to the indigenous Palestinians. Gaza is portrayed as its own sovereign entity rather than a besieged Palestinian city.  What was different about the latest media extravaganza on Palestine, however, was that the fraught relationship between mainstream media outlets and [Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald- trump-161109050153947.html) pushed for the reporting angle to change. Trump's attacks on major news organisations and the public fixation on his scandal- prone administration made media coverage of the latest assault on Palestinian rights a bit more critical, but not in the right direction.  Mainstream media presented Trump's [December 6 announcement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-jerusalem-move-key- questions-answered-171206074533021.html) as his latest blunder, further obscuring what was really going on. There was little mention of the daily struggle of Palestinians living under occupation or the history of land annexation and the [Zionisation of Jerusalem](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/jerusalem- capital-israel-170524091310050.html).  Nor was there much discussion about the fact that Trump merely chose not to sign a waiver on a declaration that the US Congress had already made two decades ago. Nor was there any reflection on how the US has enabled and funded the Israeli colonial project in Palestine. Nor was there a reference to the fact that Israel built its entire state on the premise of another declaration made a [hundred years ago](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/100-years-balfour- declaration-explained-171028055805843.html) by another man in power - Lord Arthur Balfour.   {articleGUID}   At the time when Balfour was occupying the post of British foreign secretary, the British colonial project had already produced a solid narrative presenting the Palestinian people as backward savages, justifying occupation and encouraging brutal colonial practices.  That narrative gave Balfour the confidence he needed to declare in 1917 a Jewish homeland in the region with complete disregard for the population that lived there. It also helped Zionists push the ideas that Jewish Zionists are \\\"a people without land for a land without people\\\" and that they are \\\"making the desert bloom\\\" - completely erasing the existence of a native population there.  When the Palestinians revolted in 1936 against the British Mandate and the Zionist movement, the image of the \\\"angry\\\" \\\"irrational\\\" Arab emerged. Lord William Peel, who headed the Palestine Royal Commission, was tasked with investigating the \\\"unrest\\\" and \\\"disorder\\\" in the region. The report which the commission produced barely mentioned British oppression, and much like today's mainstream media reporting, focused on the Palestinian reaction to the presence of English soldiers and the expanding Zionist endeavour.  Today, as we are supposedly in the \\\"post-colonial\\\" age, settler colonialism is considered a thing of the past. Yet, colonial bias still dominates mainstream portrayal of Palestinians. In the past few decades, Israel has been quite successful in maintaining a grip on the general narrative and ensuring that the bias persists.\\\\xa0  The Israeli authorities have meticulously pieced together the images of the \\\"angry\\\", \\\"violent\\\" and \\\"irrational\\\" Arabs and the civilisation force that the Israeli state is. They have sold it to the world in an attempt to legitimise its violations of human rights.  [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html) has also managed to mask the Palestinian question as a religious issue between Muslims/Arabs and Jews. This narrative aims to erase the Palestinian identity and portray the occupation as a religious conflict. It also makes it easier for Zionists to throw accusations of anti-Semitism at anyone that opposes and criticises Israeli colonialism.  And for decades now, the Palestinian question has been presented as a conflict between two equal sides. The context of colonisation, apartheid, illegal settlements, extrajudicial killings, home demolitions, arbitrary arrests and administrative detentions are mere footnotes in this general narrative. The word colonialism is avoided altogether because it conjures memories of the crimes of an era that Western powers would rather conveniently forget.  Nothing will change in Palestine until these colonial narratives are challenged and defeated in mainstream media. A critical mass of people around the world need to be made aware of what is really going on so that there is real and sustained pressure on governments to change their position on Palestine and stop supporting Israel's colonial project.  Maintaining this media narrative is not only a form of complicity in Israeli oppression against Palestinians, but also helps sustain it.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How mainstream media gets Palestine wrong\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/mainstream-media-palestine-wrong-171230101955202.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Amnesty International India recently launched a\\\\xa0[postcard campaign](https://amnesty.org.in/news-update/postcard-campaign-calls-end-use- pellet-firing-shotguns-kashmir/)\\\\xa0calling on the Indian government to ban [the use of pellet guns](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/07 /pellet-guns-blinding-eye-injuries-kashmir-160713083300883.html) in Jammu and [Kashmir](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/indian-administered- kashmir-141021143036795.html).

The question then arises: Are [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html) and Israel actually being more humane?

The state justifies its actions by using terms such as \\\"mobs,\\\" \\\"thugs,\\\" and \\\"rioters\\\" to describe those protesting occupation. These terms criminalise resistance and paint unarmed protesters as violent, lawless, and a public nuisance.

Then, legislators chose to send a bill, introduced by the Life and Family Foundation group to ban the abortion of sick fetuses, for more work by parliamentary commissions.  On the same day, parliament rejected a bill titled Save Women, proposed by women's rights groups, to liberalise abortion.  That measure advocated legalising abortion until the twelveth week of pregnancy and introducing sex education in schools, access to free contraception and prescription-free emergency contraception. It also included a ban on picket protests by the so-called pro-life movement displaying graphic images of fetuses, near hospitals and schools.  Abortion in Poland is illegal except in cases of rape, when there is irreparable damage to the fetus and if the pregnancy jeopardises the mother's life.  The current law was introduced in 1993 following the fall of communism.

Hailemariam, who has sat at the helm of the Ethiopian government since 2012, announced on Thursday he would be stepping down as prime minister and head of the ruling coalition.  He cited ongoing \\\"unrest and a political crisis\\\" in the country as major factors in his resignation, which he described as \\\"vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy\\\".  Awol Allo, a\\\\xa0lecturer at Keele University's School of Law and an expert on [Ethiopia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html), said the announcement\\\\xa0was not entirely unexpected, as rumours that Hailemariam would step down after the ruling party congress next month were widespread.  \\\"But [the resignation] came sooner than most had expected,\\\" Allo told Al Jazeera.  Figures within the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)\\\\xa0have been at odds, he explained, and mass protests in the country's restive Oromia region and elsewhere, calling for greater freedoms, have increased pressure on Hailemariam's government.  The ruling coalition, which controls all seats in Ethiopia's 547-strong parliament, is composed of four political parties delineated along ethnic lines: the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organisation (OPDO), the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM).  The TPLF is perceived to be the most dominant group within the ruling coalition, even though Tigrayans make up only six percent of the country's population. Members of the group also hold influential positions in the security forces and other sectors.  By contrast, the Oromo and Amhara people, who have long-standing grievances against the government and say they are politically, economically and socially marginalised, make up over 61 percent of the population.   Protests and strikes  Widespread protests broke out in the populous Oromia region, home to the Oromo, in 2015, after plans for a contentious development project in the capital, Addis Ababa, were unveiled.  But the demonstrations quickly spread to other parts of the country, including, most notably, the Amhara region, with protesters demanding\\\\xa0wider political freedom and equality, as well as an end to human rights abuses.   {articleGUID}   Hundreds of people were killed and thousands were arrested in a government crackdown that prompted condemnation from\\\\xa0[human rights groups](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/15/ethiopia-protest-crackdown-killed- hundreds).  Ethiopia also imposed a state of emergency, which was lifted after 10 months.  Still under pressure, the Ethiopian government announced plans last month to shutter an infamous prison in Addis Ababa and release thousands of prisoners, including journalists, political leaders and opposition figures.  The government has released more than 6,000 prisoners so far.  But this week, widespread youth-led protests broke out once more in Oromia and a three-day strike was declared, amid rising tension over what many viewed as the slow release of the prisoners.  The effect of these protests is \\\"unprecedented\\\" in the country's history, according to Allo.  \\\"This is the same protest movement that forced this government to declare a state of emergency, forced it to release political prisoners, [and now] forced the prime minister to resign,\\\" he said.  \\\"This protest [is what] brought about this radical change.\\\"  Jawar Mohammed, a [US](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united- states.html)-based Oromo activist and executive director of the Oromia Media Network, agreed that Hailemariam's exit was a product of the demonstrations.  The resignation also reflects the government's inability \\\"to control or respond appropriately\\\" to the protesters' demands, which include reforms to the democratic sphere and greater equality, he told Al Jazeera.  Befekadu Hailu, an Ethiopian writer and activist, echoed those sentiments, explaining that the state's earlier tactics - including the violent crackdown and the promise to release all political prisoners - did not work in stemming the unrest.  \\\"I think the pressure from the popular movements and also the reformist members of the ruling coalition forced the resignation to come early,\\\" Befekadu said.  But, according to Mohammed, whoever is appointed the next prime minister must \\\"be a reformist with strong support to implement reforms.  \\\"The issue right now is timing,\\\" he said. \\\"How fast can they reform? ...\\\\xa0The options right now are speedy reform, or a revolution where the regime will be completely swept away.\\\"   'At a crossroads'  The EPRDF\\\\xa0accepted Hailemariam's resignation\\\\xa0Thursday morning, and the coalition's council of ministers is expected to convene on Friday to name his successor, according to local media reports.\\\\xa0  Asafa Jalata, a professor of African Studies at the University of Tennesse- Knoxville whose research focuses on the Oromo, said many people in Oromia hope Lema Megersa, president of the regional government, may take on the duties of prime minister.  That could help ease ongoing political tensions in the short-term, until Ethiopians cast their votes in general elections, which are scheduled for 2020, he said.  Others have suggested that Ethiopian Foreign Minister Workneh Gebeyehu and Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen could also be considered for the position.  \\\"Ethiopia is at a crossroads,\\\" Jalata told Al Jazeera.  \\\"One would wish that learning from the past crisis, different stakeholders, including the government, would facilitate a transformation to democracy.\\\"  But major questions remain.  \\\"If they choose a candidate from either of the two main groups who have been protesting for most of the past three years, the Oromo and the Amhara, then it will be interesting to see how they are going to appease the other group that they leave out of this coalition,\\\" Al Jazeera's Mohamed Adow, reporting from Doha, said.  For his part, Befekadu said that, while it is difficult to predict what will come next, he feared the most dominant group within Ethiopia's ruling coalition, the TPLF, may take drastic measures to maintain its grip on power, including a potential coup.  \\\"That is my worst fear,\\\" Befekadu said, adding that he has not given up hope, however.  \\\"I hope there will come a person who will decide to reconcile the radicalised division in Ethiopia.

It's a windy Saturday morning and the father of seven, dressed in a faded, navy track jacket and printed yellow sarong, is walking amid the livestock outside his modest home.  Njapaa shouts to one of his grandchildren, who herds goats and sheep all day around Doldol, a small village about 250km from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.  \\\"Prepare yourself to herd these goats and sheep! Make sure you bring them back on time!\\\" he shouts upon seeing his grandson was lazing around. Normally, the livestock would have left early.  Despite going about his daily routine, Njapaa is a deeply distressed man.  A member of the Yaaku tribe of Kenya's Rift Valley,\\\\xa0the 78-year-old\\\\xa0is one of seven people who can still speak the group's native language, Yakunte. All the remaining Yakunte speakers are over the age of 70. **\\\\xa0**  \\\"It's disturbing to see that young people who are supposed to take over from us have decided to abandon this beautiful language,\\\" said Njapaa, chewing khat, a flowering plant and mild narcotic chewed by many East Africans.  \\\"Where are we heading?\\\"   History of assimilation  The Yaaku, a name which translates to the hunting people, migrated from [Ethiopia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html) to the caves and hills of the Mukogodo forest in Kenya's Rift Valley more than a century ago.  There, they began to hunt and keep bees; honey is the staple food in their diet.  At the beginning of the last century, the Maasai, a Kenyan warrior tribe and one of the largest pastoral communities in East Africa, were looking for places to settle after white settlers took their land.  They chose to resettle in the Mukogodo forest and lived alongside the Yaaku, with whom they began trading.  But due to the Yaaku's small population and lesser wealth, the Maasai saw their new neighbours as inferior, calling them Ntorobo, meaning \\\"poor people with no livestock\\\".  Njapaa, the old man, said there were about 20 Yaaku people in his village when he was born.\\\\xa0  The Yaaku began assimilating into the Maasai community and subsequently adopted the Maa language spoken by the Maasai **\\\\xa0** to ease communication.  \\\"That's when our language started dwindling slowly,\\\" Njapaa said.  Numbering only about 4,000 people in [Kenya](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kenya.html) today, the Yaaku are considered a sub-clan of the Maasai by the Kenyan government.  Njapaa said he tried to teach his children Yakunte since they were kids, but to no avail. Today, all of them use the Maasai language.  That is a common thing among younger generations of Yaaku, who are largely uninterested in learning a language that so few can speak, said Ngaine Kitarpei, 34,\\\\xa0who has volunteered in efforts to save the community's language and culture.  \\\"Many young Yaaku men and women ask us, who would [we] speak to? To them, Maasai language is easy and they communicate with it daily,\\\" Kitarpei, a father of three who cannot construct a single sentence in Yakunte, told Al Jazeera.   Reviving Yakunte?  One-third of the world's languages come from sub-Saharan Africa, UN world heritage group UNESCO estimates.  The organisation says as much as 10 percent of the over 2,000 languages spoken in the African countries may disappear within the next 100 years.  In 2010, UNESCO released a [report](http://www.unesco.org/languages- atlas/index.php?hl=en&page=atlasmap) of the world languages in danger. Yaaku is among 6 Kenyan languages listed as extinct. The others are Elmolo, Kinare, Kore, Lorkoti and Sogoo.  Local attempts to revive the language have struggled to get off the ground.  Manasseh Ole Matunge, a 52-year-old priest in Doldol, has tried to convince young people in the village to learn Yakunte while the elders are still alive.  \\\"If these old men die, that would be the end of this language,\\\" said\\\\xa0Matunge, a father of five whose grandmother was one of only two women in the village who spoke the language fluently before her death in\\\\xa02010.  \\\"Our generation and future ones will live to know that once upon a time there was a language called Yakunte,\\\" Matunge said.  In 2010, he started a cultural group to bring young people and the few fluent Yakunte speakers that are left together and published a small dictionary of Yakunte words and phrases translated into Kiswahili and Maasai.  But little has come out of his efforts.  \\\"At this point, we have done everything,\\\" Matunge told Al Jazeera.  \\\"I think it's high time we accept that our language is dead and continue speaking our neighbour's language.\\\"  Maarten Mous, a professor of African linguistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands who has extensively studied the Yaaku people, said it is impossible for the community to revive the dying language in its original form.  A more realistic goal, he said, would be to incorporate Yakunte words into the more widely used Maasai language.  \\\"Continue to speak Maasai but reshape some of the words; bring in your old remembered words from the swallowed language,\\\" Mous advised.  However, as the world observes International Mother Language Day on February 21, an annual event that celebrates multilingualism and language rights,\\\\xa0Yakunte speakers like Njapaa have lost hope.  \\\"My ancestors must be disappointed in us,\\\" he said.  \\\"We did not protect our language at all.

Mahadeen said Jordan is still transitioning from its tribal society roots into a semi-modern state.  \\\"Lacking solid legal and civic institutions, to safeguard the rights and liberties of citizens and their ability to contest government decisions, is a major impediment towards its political and economic development,\\\" he told Al Jazeera.  \\\"The Jordanian society, for several reasons, is not mature enough socially and politically to be able to mount a serious challenge to the state's ability to impose strict economic measures.\\\"   **'Violent revolt'?**   {articleGUID}   For many decades, foreign aid and remittances from expatriate Jordanians in the Gulf region were the mainstays of the Jordanian economy that kept the country afloat.  This, however, created dependency, and a succession of Jordanian governments failed to take measures to wean the country off foreign assistance and become self-reliant, according to Mahadeen.  Jordan's main problem is it hasn't progressed and developed beyond its\\\\xa0\\\"functional state\\\" roots,that is a state created to perform certain functions on behalf of others, after its creation by the British, after defeating the Ottoman Empire in World War I, he said  Abdallat - who has been imprisoned several times for his criticism of the government - said he was concerned the economic situation facing Jordan could result in an uprising.  \\\"If the current economic crisis persists, it might lead to a revolt, and I am afraid it will be a violent one,\\\" he said.   ** _Follow Ali Younes on Twitter: \\\\xa0[@ali_reports](https://twitter.com/Ali_reports)_** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Jordan's economic crisis threatens political stability\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/jordan-economic-crisis-threatens-political-stability-180214112245542.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Earlier this month, the release of Bollywood film Padmaavat sparked [protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/bollywood-film-padmaavat- releases-tight-security-180125110730219.html) across India. Hindu right-wing groups, led by members of Karni Sena, a Rajput caste organisation, vandalised public and private properties and attacked cinema halls across five Indian states, demanding the film to be banned for allegedly \\\"disrespecting the sentiments of the community\\\".\\\\xa0  The film is\\\\xa0a period drama set in the 14th century about medieval Muslim King Alauddin Khilji, Rajput ruler\\\\xa0Ratan Singh, and legendary Hindu queen Padmavati.  Were it not for the controversies surrounding its making and eventual release, Padmaavat\\\\xa0would have been just another lushly mounted, superbly operatic film from Indian director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's school of opulent film- making. Were it also not for the sharply polarised times we live in, the Indian filmgoers - as well as assorted writers, thinkers and large sections of civil society - might not have made much of the film's flawed take on history. Even its misogyny, homophobia and communal bias may have been overlooked in the face of its glossy visual extravagance.\\\\xa0  However, a ceaseless barrage of controversies from the time of the film's announcement to disruptions during its production up till its release - secured only after the intervention of the Supreme Court of India - have invested it with far more importance than it deserves. What is more, the sorry saga surrounding the film underscores yet again the thorny issue of freedom of speech vs hurt sentiments, truth vs public perception, minority vs majority discourses.  Public anger verging on mass hysteria is not a new phenomenon in India. The strident illiberals have always managed to drown out the liberal, saner voices. And that bugbear of democracy - public opinion - has often decided what we should eat, drink, watch, read and so on.\\\\xa0  In the past, films starring Aamir Khan, such as Fanaa, faced an unofficial ban in Gujarat due to the actor's [defence](http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/may/25aamir1.htm) of people displaced by the expansion of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, which angered the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruling the state. The 2007 film Parzania, a clear-eyed look at communal riots in Gujarat, was also banned in the state, as was Firaaq - Nandita Das's directorial debut. Others with overt sexual content, such as Bandit Queen, Fifty Shades of Grey or Kamasutra, found release after multiple and often mutilating cuts.  > What is reprehensible is his distortion of a beautiful Sufi love poem, redolent with evocative images of multi-culturalism and syncretism, into something divisive and insulting. > > \\\\xa0 > >   Seldom has a Hindi film generated the sort of fire and fury Padmaavat has unleashed in large parts of the country; seldom has the release of a film been delayed till the results of elections in two influential states (Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh in this case); and seldom has a film divided the viewing public along such unapologetically communal lines.  Watching the film, one wonders what the furore was all about. If anyone should take offence, it is neither the ultranationalists nor the vigilante group that calls itself the Karni Sena whose self-appointed brief is to protect the interests of the Rajput community; it is the Muslims of India.  They should be offended by the film's demonisation of Muslims and all liberal, secular Indians who take strong objection to the glorification of the pernicious practice of \\\"jauhar\\\", in which women commit mass immolation when their men go off on a doomed battle. While the film has been banned in Malaysia for its distinct communal bias, the Muslims in India are showing remarkable restraint.  They are leaving it to their secular, liberal countrymen to speak up against Bhansali's ham-handed attempt to valorise one community while demonising the other and for setting up crude binaries: Hindu vs Muslim, native vs foreign, defender vs invader, pure vs impure, virtuous vs vile, refined vs coarse, and so on.  Louche and menacing when not outright sinister and bestial, actor Ranveer Singh's portrayal of Allauddin Khilji feeds every Hindu right-wing cliche about Muslims. His slanting kohl-lined eyes heightening an almost feral appearance, his homoerotic encounters with the slave Malik Kafur, his lust for both men and women matched only by his greed for the untold wealth of Hindustan and his unbridled ambition to sit on the throne of Delhi at all cost combine to make him the stereotyped wicked foreign invader that the Hindu right would have us believe all Muslims have always been in India's history.  In comparison, the serene and stately Ratan Sen, played by actor Shahid Kapoor, is the epitome of grace as the valiant ruler of Chittor. He indeed makes several very silly decisions, but all in the name of upholding his \\\"usool\\\" (principles). And the statuesque Deepika Padukone as the legendary Rani Padmavati, the lotus-like beauty venerated in Rajasthan as a heroic queen - not only for her redoubtable qualities of head and heart, but also statesmanship and skill with sword and bow alike - is relentlessly gorgeous.  While a directive from the Central Board of Film Certification compelled Bhansali to change the name of his film from Padmavati to Padmaavat - to emphasise the fact that the film is based on the fictional poem \\\"Padmaavat\\\" and not history - he is either unable or unwilling to engage with the spirit of the medieval text he admits basing his film on.  The original poem, composed in Awadhi though written in the Farsi script in 1540 by a Sufi poet named Malik Muhammad Jayasi, borrows from the existing tradition of \\\"premakhyanaka kavya\\\" or \\\"poetry of the tales of love\\\" to make a larger, deeply philosophical observation about the transience of all life.  In Jayasi's allegorical tale, Chittor is the body, Ratan Sen the mind; Padmavati the intellect, Ratan Sen's first wife, Nagmati, the cares of this world; the discredited courtier Raghava is the devil; and the sultan represents illusion. Hiraman, the parrot, is the spiritual guide who shows the way. Needless to say, Bhansali has done away with the parrot and lost his way in the quicksand of chauvinism and chicanery.  Had Bhansali simply taken the figure of Padmavati, a figment of Jayasi's imagination, and spun a yarn of valour and romance perhaps he could have been forgiven. What is reprehensible is his distortion of a beautiful Sufi love poem, redolent with evocative images of multiculturalism and syncretism, into something divisive and insulting.  In his glorification of women taking their own lives for the sake of upholding their family's honour, Bhansali is peddling regressive, patriarchal values in the guise of hyper-nationalism. In depicting the siege of Chittor as an early example of the perfidious practice of Muslim men dishonouring chaste Hindu women, he is lending credence to the obnoxious coinage \\\"[love jihad](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/hadiya-case-myth- love-jihad-india-170823181612279.html)\\\".  And, worst of all, in establishing the binary of a valiant and honourable Hindu king fighting a just war against the treacherous Muslim invader, Bhansali is feeding the paranoia of an already divided society.\\\\xa0   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"How Bollywood's Padmaavat distorted a Sufi love poem\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/bollywood-padmaavat-distorted-sufi-love-poem-180131135353836.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ One of the few things stranger than the powerful influence of Christian Evangelicals on the Trump administration is the embrace of [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald- trump-161109050153947.html) by Christian Evangelicals.  Incidentally, when we use the word \\\"Evangelicals\\\" here, we are using it in the manner it is most used in US political commentary, to refer to conservative, white Protestants. There are white Evangelicals who are politically liberal. But they are few. They are so few that 81 percent of white Evangelicals who voted in 2016 voted for Trump.  There are also African American Evangelicals. They vote for Democrats. There are some Latino Evangelicals, though most are not Protestants.\\\\xa0  Such Evangelicals have long been self-described \\\"values voters\\\" and the \\\"moral majority\\\". The idea of \\\"values\\\" here does not refer to paying taxes for more and better public [education](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/education.html), medical care, social services and the like that benefit the society at large and should stem from the Christian values of compassion and care for the poor. It does not refer to defending the oppressed or welcoming [refugees](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/refugees.html).  Rather, it refers to a very singular idea of \\\"family\\\" and what needs to be done in order to \\\"protect\\\" it. Two of the more powerful religious-political organisations in the US are called Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council. Evangelicals oppose any policy, behaviour or practice that they deem threatening to a monogamous two-gender marriage.  Trump has been divorced twice. Married three times. He married his second wife after she had their child. He is a serial adulterer who has bragged about it. Yet Evangelicals have embraced him even more fervently than they were appalled by Bill Clinton.  Back in the 1990s, when Clinton was president, conservative Christians chastised him over with his extramarital affairs and the accusations of sexual harassment he faced.  One of them was James Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, who in 1998 wrote this about Clinton: \\\"Character DOES matter. You can't run a family, let alone a country, without it. How foolish to believe that a person who lacks honesty and moral integrity is qualified to lead a nation and the world!\\\"  > The intertwining of these things - of seeking 'moral integrity' and voting for Trump, of supporting a Jewish state and believing that Jews cannot go to heaven - is not based on logic.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   In 2016, Christianity Today ran an article with the headline, \\\"James Dobson: Why I Am Voting for Donald Trump\\\". In the article, Dobson talked about many things but never Trump's \\\"moral integrity\\\"; he did, however, say, rather forgivingly: \\\"I'm not under any illusions that he is an outstanding moral example, but I do think he's a good father.\\\"\\\\xa0  Pat Robertson, televangelist and head of Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), called Bill Clinton a \\\"debauched, debased and defamed\\\" leader.  In 2017, interviewing Trump on CBN, Robertson fawningly told him, \\\"I'm so proud of everything you're doing.\\\"  In the late 1970s, a small group of far-right conservatives came up with a plan to bring white Evangelicals into politics as Republican voters. They picked Jerry Falwell to be the pastoral leader of their idea which morphed into a political organisation called the Moral Majority. Falwell was hugely successful. The centre of his empire was Liberty University. It survived him and is now run by his son, Jerry Falwell Jr.  Jerry Jr has called Trump a \\\"dream president\\\", who \\\"lives a life of loving and helping others as Jesus taught in the Great Commandment.\\\" He most recently defended Trump's alleged sexual misconduct by saying \\\"we are all equally bad, we are all sinners.\\\"  Various apologists for this disappearance of values and taking up the standard that \\\"character doesn't matter\\\", make the claim that Trump's very recently discovered opposition to abortion outweighs everything else, so they overlook the carnal sins, the meanness, the money-grubbing greed; they hold their noses and vote for the one important virtue. Evangelicals enthuse over Trump; they adore him, they embrace him.  Admittedly, in some areas, Trump has returned their embrace. He has, without doubt, given them the Supreme Court justice they wanted.\\\\xa0  Certainly, with his pick of Mike Pence as vice president, he also embraced Evangelicals. Pence is a genuine \\\"born-again Christian\\\". This could be a religious designation, but as in Pence's case, it is more generally, and more significantly, a political one. He calls himself, \\\"Christian, conservative, Republican, in that order.\\\" He is against the [Iran deal](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/trump-iran- deal-171011140146595.html), against a Palestinian state, and very pro-Israel.  The fervent commitment of Evangelicals, like Pence, to [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html), seems to be rooted in a belief that it is necessary for Israel to be back in the hands of the Jews for the second coming of Jesus Christ to take place. According to this belief, the Rapture would send all the good true Christians to heaven and leave behind the bad and non-believers - including the Jews - in an all- inclusive hell on earth. That means that Christian Zionism concludes with an act of the ultimate anti-Semitism.\\\\xa0  The intertwining of these things - of seeking \\\"moral integrity\\\" and voting for Trump, of supporting a Jewish state and believing that Jews cannot go to heaven - is not based on logic.  The contradictions point to things that are very different than what people say they're concerned about. Evangelicals - who purported to be values voters, members of the moral majority, and to care about character - becoming dedicated Trump supporters tells us that those beliefs are makeup and masks that people wear so that when they look in their political mirrors, they see good people looking back at them.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance._ ** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Trump and the Evangelical electorate\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/trump-evangelical-electorate-180126090925883.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Yemenis have launched a social media campaign with the hashtag [BringDevBack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BringDevBack?src=hash)\\\\xa0-\\\\xa0or Bring Development Back to Yemen - highlighting how years of war have destroyed the opportunity for development.

The Tunisian economy has been in the spotlight this month after\\\\xa0[anti- austerity protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/tunisians-march- seventh-anniversary-uprising-180114130043892.html)\\\\xa0broke out in cities across the country.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/19/2a44a54d60b5408798a59fb0e041918e_18.jpg)  ---  Tunisians have protested this month over the rising cost of basic goods [Zoubeir Souissi/Reuters]     Under the slogan [Fech Nestannew](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/qa- tunisia-protest-leaders-vow-pressure-180114072916448.html)\\\\xa0(What are we waiting for?), protesters have called for the government to scrap a budget law for 2018 that raised the price of basic goods and value-added taxes on citizens.  Many Tunisians are also calling for an end to corruption and privatisation and for young people to have greater access to public sector jobs.\\\\xa0  Nejib Mohamed, communications director of the Tunisian-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which organised the economic forum, said Tunisian business leaders are hopeful Macron will announce new investments.  Those can \\\"create wealth\\\" and lead to more local jobs, Mohamed told Al Jazeera.  \\\"If international groups invest in Tunisia, that's a vote of confidence in the country,\\\"\\\\xa0he said.  During a visit to Tunisia last October, Edouard Philippe, France's prime minister, signed business deals worth more than $100m in several fields, including agriculture, renewable energy and education.  Asked whether he believed Tunisian businesses were adequately helping the country deal with its current economic problems, Mohamed said companies \\\"have a mission to contribute to the creation of wealth and jobs\\\" in Tunisia.   Security issues\\\\xa0  Sarah Yerkes, a fellow in the Middle East programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said people should not have false hope that Macron will solve Tunisia's economic problems.  \\\"There's already this massive expectations gap problem in Tunisia; people have not gotten from the revolution what they've expected to,\\\" she said.   {articleGUID}   More than seven years after a popular revolution toppled longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, many Tunisians say the economy is worse than ever before.  Unemployment sits at about 15 percent, and\\\\xa0among\\\\xa0[youth](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/kill-tunisian- youth-margins-180116180238426.html)\\\\xa0around 30 percent.  \\\"That's where I would be a little bit worried, if people think that Macron is going to come in and save the day and he doesn't,\\\" Yerkes said.  She said she expected migration to be a point of focus during Macron's visit, as well as security, including cooperation and training to secure the porous Libya-Tunisia border. \\\"With Libya next door, I'm sure there will be some discussion about that kind of security cooperation.\\\"  Tasnim Abderrahim, a Tunisian researcher at the European Centre for Development Policy Management, told Al Jazeera the focus of Tunisia's international partners has shifted strongly towards security since a string of violent attacks took place in the country in 2015.  \\\"In terms of security, you have the fight against terrorism, counter- radicalisation and then border security with Libya,\\\" she said, explaining Libya has become a major focal point for France and the European Union, which are seeking to stem the flow of asylum seekers attempting to reach Europe.  \\\"The EU describes Tunisia as the exceptional experience, as the unique experience, as the democratic model, and then Tunisian officials say we want more concrete action to match this rhetoric,\\\" Abderrahim said.   EU blacklist  The visit also comes after the EU removed Tunisia from a blacklist of countries it designated as tax havens.  The country had been added to the list in early December for allegedly being host to \\\"harmful preferential tax regimes\\\". The United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Bermuda and others were also taken off the list at the same time.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/26/4760baada2ae4aacb255ffc93598b604_18.jpg)  ---  Macron met his Tunisian counterpart, Beji Caid Essebsi, in Paris last December [Yoan Valat/Reuters]     But the EU did not explain what steps Tunisia or any of the other countries had undertaken since December to warrant their removal. Tunisia now figures on a grey list of tax havens.  According to Cherif, being on the list has put \\\"a lot of pressure on Tunisia\\\" because of its current economic crisis, and as it is about to go back to negotiations over a free trade deal with the EU.  \\\"Putting Tunisia on that list gives Tunisia less power or less leverage in negotiating that free trade agreement with the EU,\\\" he said.  According to Abderrahim, the Tunisian government fears the designation will draw \\\"away investments that Tunisia really needs for its economic recovery\\\".  She said the government in Tunis wants support from France on its socioeconomic development, as well as at the EU level. It wants Tunisian citizens, especially young people, to get visas to European countries more easily.  But while the Tunisian government has high expectations, most citizens do not. \\\"What Tunisians want is more from their government and not much from their international partners,\\\" Abderrahim said.  For that reason, she said Macron's visit will be \\\"just business as usual\\\".  \\\"It will be conventional diplomacy and the official discourse and joint statements...

According to a report by the Scottish government's advisory panel on hate crime, Islamophobic attacks rose by 89 percent between 2015 and 2016.  Abuse, the report noted, rose following attacks where the perpetrator was revealed to be of Muslim background, with collective punishment rolled out to Islamic communities.

A Scottish Labour Party spokesperson said in a statement that Sarwar's experience was \\\"completely unacceptable\\\".  \\\"Labour has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of racism and bigotry. This reported behaviour falls well short of what we expect,\\\" the spokesperson said, promising an investigation.  First Leader Nicola Sturgeon has praised Sarwar's openness.  \\\"Anas and I are political opponents locally as well as nationally, but I genuinely admire the way he has spoken up this week, and the bravery with which he has done it,\\\" she said in parliament.  \\\"It would be brave in any circumstances but I think all of us know that when we're raising issues that involve people within our own parties that is even more difficult to do, and therefore, the praise should be even greater for having done so.\\\"  Humza Yousaf, Scottish National Party politician and transport minister said on Twitter: \\\"Utterly shocking ...

In South Yemen, Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) partially succeeded in controlling the tribes, but military conflicts within the party, including the 1986 civil war in the south, were still fought along tribal lines. The unification of North and South Yemen in 1990 also failed to establish modern state institutions in the country, allowing some tribal leaders to maintain their political influence to this day.  When [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/yemen/2011/02/201122812118938648.html) came to power in North Yemen in 1978, and became the first president of unified Yemen in 1990, he was well aware of the importance of tribes. Thus, he expended an enormous amount of political capital and financial resources to establish alliances with key tribal leaders.  The most significant tribal alliance he established was with the late Sheikh\\\\xa0Abdullah al-Ahmar, who headed the powerful Hashid tribal federation for more than four decades, until his death in 2007. The Sheikh, who also served as the speaker of the House of Representatives between 1993 and 2007, once described his complicated relationship with Saleh by stating that \\\"Saleh is my president, but I'm his sheikh.\\\"  During his time in power, Saleh showered tribal leaders and key figures from Hashid, Sanaa - Saleh's own tribe and also part of the Hashid federation - and other tribes with the highest military positions, government contracts, and generous financial support. Saleh also allowed [Saudi Arabia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html) to continue its patronage of key Yemeni tribal leaders, including Sheikh al- Ahmar.\\\\xa0  Yet, in the final days before his assassination, none of Yemen's tribal leaders answered Saleh's calls for help. Why did these tribes decide to abandon Saleh? Why did they not come to his rescue? And does this indicate the end of tribal politics in Yemen?\\\\xa0   **The collapse of the Saleh-Hashid alliance** **\\\\xa0**  The collapse of Saleh's tribal alliances did not come as a surprise to anyone following Yemen's political scene closely.  First, cracks in President Saleh's alliance with the Hashid federation started to appear in the 2000's, when he attempted to pave the way for his eldest son, Ahmed, to succeed him. In an attempt to secure Ahmed's path to power, Saleh started assigning a new generation of actors loyal to him to important posts, while simultaneously attempting to sideline his old tribal and military allies, including Sheikh al-Ahmar and General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who was once Saleh's top military aide.  Saleh's decision to designate his son, Ahmed, as heir to the presidency raised significant concerns, as well as political jealousy, among younger sheikhs, including the likes of Hamid al-Ahmar, who is the wealthiest and most influential among the sons of Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar. Consequently, when the Yemeni uprising erupted in 2011, most tribal leaders positioned themselves against the president.  During and after the Yemeni uprising, Saleh did not realise that by weakening the Hashid federation and his former military allies such as General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, he was actually undermining his own residual political and military power.  The delicate, domestic balance of power that had supported Saleh for more than three decades completely withered in 2014, when Saleh reached out to the [Houthis](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/houthis.html), his former enemies, to forge the most controversial and bewildering political coalition of his lifetime.  Even when the Houthis demolished Sheikh al-Ahmar's house in Khamir later that year, Saleh failed to question the reliability of his new allies. He mistakenly thought that his freshly-minted alliance with the Houthis would ensure his security and save him from a similar faith. This, of course, was not the case. What Saleh failed to understand was that political ambitions of the Houthis would not allow the survival of any rival political power in the long run, whether this political power was a tribal leader or a former president with ambitions of returning to power.   **The Houthis factor**  The Houthis, a group of [Shia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/shia.html) rebels that currently control the capital, Sanaa, and large expanses of the country, emerged on Yemen's political scene equipped with deeply rooted social connections and an extensive understating of the best practices in tribal mobilisation. They shrewdly exploited the increased gap between rich tribal leaders and their economically deprived tribesmen.\\\\xa0  A large segment of the tribesmen who joined the Houthis had been neglected for years by both the government and their own tribal leaders. With little education and a \\\"nothing to lose\\\" mentality, these poor tribesmen saw in the Houthis an exciting opportunity to improve their own economic well being. These tribesmen, poor but highly skilled in military conflicts, have fuelled the Houthis' quick rise to power.  With a slogan as unrelated to Yemeni domestic politics as \\\"death to America, death to Israel\\\", these tribesmen eliminated all Houthi opponents in quick succession. Even though they belonged to various tribes, they wasted little time replacing their old tribal allegiances with a strong allegiance to the Houthis, who presented themselves as the progenies of the Zaydi heritage in North Yemen. Indeed, Zaydism has been the official doctrine of the government that ruled North Yemen for about a thousand years.  Some of Saleh's tribal allies joined the Houthis in their 2014 military march towards Sanaa to politically eliminate President [Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/02/2012219133034774204.html), the Islah Party, and the al-Ahmar family on direct orders from the former president. But it did not take very long for these tribesmen to see the Houthis as a rising power and Saleh as a lost cause, and they swiftly shifted alliances.  Furthermore, the Houthis used extreme coercive measures against tribal and military opponents, including demolishing homes, confiscating businesses, and displacing families. These brutal tactics made some of Saleh's remaining tribal allies reluctant about coming to his rescue when he needed them most.\\\\xa0   **The end of Saleh's tribal patronage system**  Saleh's patronage system was significantly weakened once he stepped down from the presidency in 2012, because he was not able to support it financially. When he left the presidency, Saleh lost control of the state's financial resources, as well as his influence over the Saudi patronage system in Yemen.\\\\xa0  It is believed that Saleh accumulated vast wealth during his time in power, but he certainly did not spend this money to keep his tribal allies happy after he left office. Most importantly, when the Houthis targeted and humiliated some of Saleh's tribal allies and loyal military officers, he did nothing to stop them. On the contrary, he continued to assure the public that his alliance with the Houthis was intact against the Saudi-led coalition. The Houthis exploited Saleh's mistakes extremely well, and gradually worked towards alienating him further from his remaining tribal allies.  Thus, when Saleh called for his tribal allies to stand up against the Houthis, just two days before his assassination, nobody came to his rescue. Instead, the Houthis acted very swiftly and surrounded his residence before killing him and officially rendering his patronage system obsolete.  Does this mean that there will be no future return of tribal politics in post- Houthis' Yemen? That is unlikely to happen. Ma'rb Sunni tribes' support for the government of President Hadi\\\\xa0suggests that Yemeni tribes will continue to play a significant role in the country's future. It will undoubtedly require a strong political will and a lot more effort for Yemen to one day fit into the Weberian definition of a modern state.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy._ \\\\xa0** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Ali Abdullah Saleh's assassination and Yemen's tribes\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/ali-abdullah-saleh-assassination-yemen-tribes-180111110844565.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ There is much talk these days about Israel's \\\"creeping annexation\\\" of the [occupied West Bank](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/occupied-west- bank.html), from both critics and proponents alike.  Critics say Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/01/201311113412274889.html)'s government, dominated by right-wing nationalists in both the Likud and Jewish Home parties, has been advancing various laws designed to prepare the ground for [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Israel.html) to annex portions of the occupied territory.  The Knesset passed legislation on February 12 that applies Israeli law to settler academic institutions in the occupied West Bank, such as Ariel University, founded in an Israeli settlement of the same name near the Palestinian town of Salfit.  Simultaneously, the justice ministry is advancing a law that would expand the jurisdiction of Israeli courts over Area C, which comprises 60 percent of the West Bank.  On the ground, however, there is a familiar story, one just as important as the Knesset manoeuvres and legal initiatives - and one without which \\\"creeping annexation\\\" would not even be possible.   Settlements 'legal' and 'unauthorised'  While there are 132 official settlements in the West Bank - not including [occupied East Jerusalem](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/east- jerusalem.html) \\\\- there are some 100 additional, technically unauthorised, settlement outposts.  Increasingly, these \\\"unauthorised\\\" outposts are being \\\"legalised\\\".   {articleGUID}   Although Israeli law differentiates between the two, \\\"there is no serious factual question with regard to Israel's responsibility for the construction and expansion of settlements, whether they are described as 'legal settlements' or 'outposts,'\\\" Hagai El-Ad,\\\\xa0director of Israeli human rights NGO B'Tselem, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"One way or another, this is all part of a state-led project.\\\"  On January 31, the Israeli government approved the retroactive legalisation of the Havat Gilad settlement outpost near Nablus, which will now become an official settlement.  The outpost was first established in 2002 and is found roughly a kilometre from the Kedumim settlement.  The outpost expanded, over the years, on privately-owned Palestinian land, and now boasts some 75 buildings, mostly residential.  The [expansion](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/palestinians-condemn- alleged-settlement-annexation-plan-180212181214554.html) took place with the full knowledge of Israeli authorities, B'Tselem noted.  The story of Havat Gilad is not unusual. As B'Tselem observed, this method has been applied across the West Bank, \\\"enabling the state to establish and expand dozens of settlements while claiming internationally that it is not\\\".  In addition to helping minimise international criticism, Israel's strategy of colonising the West Bank through settlements of, in El-Ad's words, \\\"various formal flavours\\\", also helps create \\\"facts on the ground\\\" to take into negotiations.  Outposts become \\\"legalised\\\" settlements, and settlements expand and become so- called blocs - areas that Israel then insists must be retained in any peace deal with the Palestinians.   Displacement as policy  A similar and parallel process is evident with respect to displacement, Palestinians say.  Hazem Jamjoum, an Al-Shabaka policy member and doctoral candidate in Middle Eastern history at NYU, told Al Jazeera that in the West Bank, many Palestinians \\\"constantly live under the threat of displacement, or are already dealing with the consequences of being on the long list of those who are next for such treatment\\\".  Jamjoum clarified that this displacement is carried out not just through [home demolitions](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/israel- settlements-road-cut-east-jerusalem-170219102243614.html), but \\\"by making life outside the areas of concentrated Palestinian population unliveable, by cutting access to the fundamentals of life such as water, electricity and mobility\\\".  Edward Said described this pace of displacement as \\\"punishment by detail\\\", Jamjoum noted - the \\\"obliteration of an entire people by slow, systematic methods of suffocation\\\".  Suhail Khalilieh, political analyst and expert on Israeli settlements at The Applied Research Institute, Jerusalem, agreed.  \\\"Israel has made sure that the Palestinian communities exist without any infrastructure, or even the ability to have any in the future,\\\" Khalilieh told Al Jazeera, \\\"including education, health, roads, [water](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/israel-water-tool-dominate- palestinians-160619062531348.html), and electricity\\\".  The regular demolitions, he adds, are \\\"a reminder of who is in charge\\\".   'Resistance steadfastness'  Israel's strategy of incremental colonisation and displacement prompts difficult questions for Palestinians, with respect to options or strategies for both resistance and mobilising international opposition to Israeli moves.  \\\"There is no straightforward answer to this question,\\\" Khalilieh told Al Jazeera.  Khalileh listed various options facing Palestinians such as \\\"going to the United Nations Security Council\\\", as well as \\\"non-violent resistance\\\" or \\\"armed resistance.  \\\"The fact is that none of these options is guaranteed to present the Palestinians with the outcomes they look for without sustaining considerable losses,\\\" he said.  Jamjoum pointed to how \\\"Palestinian political organizers in the early 1980s developed the concept of 'resistance steadfastness' - a 'social infrastructure' that gives a Palestinian family the support it needs 'to remain in its home and on its land.'\\\"  This can include \\\"food and healthcare provision, physical obstruction of Israeli demolition and eviction attempts, international campaigning on particularly egregious cases\\\".  But the regional and international balance of power has meant that Palestinians on the ground \\\"must now hold the line with far less realistic hope of external support\\\", and without any \\\"effective and systematic action\\\" from international powers to prevent Israeli displacement of Palestinians, Jamjoum said.  For El-Ad, that urgently-needed action from the international community to \\\"reject the occupation\\\" should not be dependent on developments around any specific outpost or act of displacement.  \\\"The broad picture of the reality of the occupation is well-established and documented: There is no need for any additional step to cross a threshold demanding international action, for that threshold has been already crossed a long time ago,\\\" El-Ad concluded. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Israel's 'creeping' settlements continue expanding\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/israel-creeping-settlements-continue-expanding-180303201420050.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ US President [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald- trump.html) has argued that the death penalty is a fitting punishment for drug traffickers heightening the opioid epidemic.  The scourge has torn through the rural and working-class communities that, in large numbers, voted for Trump. And the president, though he has come under criticism for being slow to unveil his plan, has seized on harsh sentences as key to stopping the plague.  \\\"Toughness is the thing that they most fear,\\\" Trump said on Monday.\\\\xa0   Tough punishment  Trump made his announcement in New Hampshire, a state hit hard by opioids and an early marker for the re-election campaign he has already announced. He called for broadening education and awareness about drug addiction while expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts.  But the backbone of his plan is to toughen punishments for those caught trafficking highly addictive drugs.  \\\"This isn't about nice any more,\\\" Trump said. \\\"This is about winning a very, very tough problem and if we don't get very tough on these dealers it's not going to happen folks ... I want to win this battle.\\\"  The president formalised what he had long mused about: that if a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, a similar punishment should be given to a drug dealer whose product potentially kills thousands.   Death penalty  The Justice Department said the federal death penalty is available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the \\\"drug kingpin\\\" provisions in federal law.  It is not clear if the death penalty, even for traffickers whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, predicted the issue would go all the way to the United States Supreme Court.  John Blume, a professor and director of Cornell Law School's death penalty programme, said the federal drug kingpin law has yielded few \\\"kingpins\\\" or major dealers, mostly ensnaring mid- to low-level minorities involved in the drug trade.   Criticism  The president's plan drew criticism from some Democrats, including Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said \\\"we can't arrest our way out of the opioid epidemic\\\" and noted that \\\"the war on drugs didn't work in the '80s.\\\"  Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any other year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Much of what Trump highlighted Monday was largely repackaged ideas he had already endorsed.  He called for a nationwide public awareness campaign, which he announced in the fall, including broadcasting \\\"great commercials\\\" to scare kids away from dabbling in drugs. He announced a new website, www.crisisnextdoor.gov, where members of the public can share stories about the dangers of opioid addiction.   US-Mexico wall  The US president also discussed how his policies, including building a US- Mexico border wall and punishing \\\"sanctuary\\\" cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration authorities, will help reduce the flow of drugs.  Monday was Trump's first visit as president to New Hampshire, which has long occupied a special place in his political rise. He captured his first Republican presidential primary here in 2016, though he narrowly lost in the general election to Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Trump drew criticism last year after leaked transcripts of a telephone conversation with Mexican President [Enrique Pena Nieto](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/enrique-pena-nieto.html) showed he had described New Hampshire as a \\\"drug-infested den\\\". The Washington Post published the transcripts.  Though the 2020 election is more than 30 months away, early jockeying is already happening in states that play an outsized early role in choosing a party's nominee. Retiring senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, a persistent Trump critic, visited New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first presidential primary, last week. He told Republicans someone needs to stop Trump - and it could be him if no one steps up.  Meanwhile, the president's daughter, White House Senior Adviser Ivanka Trump, spent Monday discussing infrastructure and workplace development in Iowa, which traditionally holds the first presidential nominating caucus. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Trump wants death penalty for opioid\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/trump-death-penalty-opioid-180320155911439.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[  **Abuja, Nigeria** \\\\- It's a few minutes past 9am and Sunana Ibrahim Wariga's daily struggle is just beginning.

The [Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald- trump-161109050153947.html) administration announced in September that the programme, which protects 800,000 individuals, would be phased out by March, unless Democrats could agree with Republicans to an increase in immigration enforcement, including a [US-Mexico border wall](https://youtu.be/jJ4nHnsfxNY).\\\\xa0  Judge William Alsup wrote in his January decision that \\\"DACA covers a class of immigrants whose presence, seemingly all agree, pose the least, if any, threat and allows them to sign up for honest labor on the condition of continued good behavior\\\".  DACA-protected immigrants, sometimes called \\\"Dreamers\\\" because of never-passed legislation, are often considered a benefit to the US economy. They have an employment rate of nearly 90 percent in well-paying jobs and about 75 percent are enrolled in institutions of higher education.  \\\"This has become an important programme for DACA recipients and their families, for the employers who hire them, for our tax treasuries, and for our economy,\\\" Alsup added.  But the ruling \\\"shouldn't give us false hope, we need a permanent solution,\\\" said Quinonez, who came to the US from Mexico with his family when he was seven years old.  During Trump's first year, life in the US for undocumented immigrants, including those protected by DACA, has \\\"gotten much worse,\\\" Quinonez said.   November 8, 2016 - 'None of us imagined'  The road to a permanent solution for Dreamers has been long and convoluted. Former President Barack Obama announced DACA in 2012, after the Republican- controlled Congress voted against several immigration reform bills during his first term.\\\\xa0  Obama's track record on immigration is also complex. He has received credit from many for DACA, and his 2014 attempt to expand the programme to include more undocumented individuals, which was later blocked by the Supreme Court after 26 states sued over its implementation.  But Obama was also popularly called the \\\"deporter-in-chief\\\", a play on the US president's title of \\\"commander-in-chief\\\" of the US armed forces, for widespread removals of undocumented migrants.  Quinonez said he and his family were at first distrustful of the programme.  \\\"I wasn't sure if I wanted to apply. I wasn't sure if I could trust the government,\\\" Quinonez recalled.\\\\xa0  Furthermore, DACA didn't provide a permanent pathway to citizenship, making it a stopgap measure.   {articleGUID}   Quinonez said his family discussed if it made sense to spend money on a college education, when any future president could end the programme.  But Quinonez did apply, was granted protection from deportation, graduated from university and now works in politics.  Like many, especially in left-leaning Washington state, everything he knew about politics suggested that Trump would [never be elected](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/trump-victory- movement-161109111846362.html).  \\\"None of us imagined that someone like Trump would run for president, win the Republican nomination and become president of the US,\\\" Quinonez said.  Trump ran on a platform that many said was xenophobic and racist, allegations the now US president denies. When he announced his candidacy in 2015, the Trump infamously said that immigrants from Mexico are \\\"bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists\\\", before saying he assumed that \\\"some are good people.\\\"  An integral part of this platform was building a wall on the US-Mexico border and initiating a crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the US.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/16/10d18730b0784cb29ac3a8792115fedd_18.jpg)  ---  The DACA programme grants protections to about 800,000 people [John Locher/AP Photo]\\\\xa0     When Trump won on November 8, 2016, Quinonez said he \\\"was in shock for the next couple of days.

The effects were felt in the Quinonez family and throughout the community. He said his \\\"parents started talking to their children about possibly moving back to Mexico\\\".

On January 25, Trump signed two executive orders, the first was the \\\"Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,\\\" and the second \\\"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\\\".  The orders prioritised the construction of the US-Mexico border wall and granted expanded powers to immigration authorities to increase deportations and detentions.  By February, ICE had instituted [a nationwide crackdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/afghan-served-military- detained-ice-170331204414036.html) on undocumented immigrants.

Trump's crackdown prompted many cities to adopt so-called \\\"[sanctuary city](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/protests-grow-texas-moves- sanctuary-cities-170202205015258.html)\\\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with immigration authorities.   {articleGUID}   Fearing potential death if returned to their countries of origin, some undocumented immigrants[\\\\xa0have taken refuge](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/sanctuary-churches-fight-trump- deportation-surge-171217120745656.html) in houses of worship, hoping ICE wouldn't violate its own protocol to not carry out raids on religious establishments.  Juan Belman, an Austin-based dreamer and local activist that works to provide undocumented individuals with legal support, told Al Jazeera that Trump's first year has created an environment that inspires people to get involved.  \\\"We've seen a lot more people become engaged in all these issues. It's crazy, right? We only see this increase in activism after something bad has happened,\\\" Belman said.  The 25-year-old dreamer, who was brought to the US at the age of 10, said the \\\"bad\\\" he's referring to is an \\\"increase in interior enforcement\\\".  The number of deportations under Trump [was lower](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/migrant-agenda-dangerous- deportations-cut-180101172616407.html) than any from Obama's last years in office, but the\\\\xa0decline comes because US Border Patrol are apprehending \\\"fewer people trying to cross the US-Mexico border\\\", Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) told Al Jazeera.  CIS, which is supportive of Trump's immigration policy, was labelled a \\\"hate group\\\" last year by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for its ties to John Tanton, the \\\"father of the modern nativist movement\\\" which is \\\"anti- immigrant\\\". The group describes itself a \\\"low-immigration\\\", but \\\"pro- immigrant\\\", nonprofit.\\\\xa0  Vaughan said lower border detentions are \\\"a sign that fewer people are trying to cross illegally, most likely because they are deterred by Trump's promises of more serious enforcement\\\".   ![](/mritems/Images/2017/11/7/301b59a116334879a7e158aedfcf254c_18.jpg)  ---  Jeff Sessions has ordered the review of 'administrative closures', which allows immigrants to stay in the US while their petitions are vetted [Joshua Roberts/Reuters]     Inside the US, Trump has increased detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants both with and without criminal records.  Although total deportations have decreased, detentions of undocumented immigrants increased to 143,470 in 2017, up from slightly over 110,000 in 2016.  Many of those detained are required to stand before a judge in an immigration court.  These courts decide the status of the undocumented and face a backlog of over 500,000 cases. This number began building under the Obama administration and steadily increased in Trump's first year.  Even though many in Belman's community have become more involved in the pro- immigrant fight, finding legal support is still difficult, he explained.  \\\"In Austin, we have developed a community hotline so we can help people with legal support,\\\" but \\\"trying to find legal representation for everyone is very difficult,\\\" Belman said.  It's not only lawyers, but also immigrant judges who preside over these courts that face a shortfall.   {articleGUID}   There are currently about 300 immigration judges, and New York-based watchdog group Human Rights First says an additional 120 are needed to handle the current backlog.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the official who announced the rescinding of the DACA programme in September, is considering ending \\\"administrative closures\\\". He launched a review of the practice this month.\\\\xa0  Administrative closures allow undocumented individuals to stay in the country while their petitions are vetted by parties outside the immigration courts.\\\\xa0  If Sessions ends the practice, an additional 350,000 cases will be re-opened in immigrant courts.  This would \\\"flood the courts\\\", Belman said. \\\"I don't know what we would do handle an increase like that.\\\"   January 19, 2018 - A 'deal with the devil'  While the Trump administration has held the status of Dreamers hostage for Trump's border wall, Democrats are using the US federal budget to push immigration protections forward.  The deadline for a spending agreement to avert a government shutdown is January 19, the day before the first anniversary of Trump's presidency. Any US budget agreement will require Democratic support to pass the Senate, and the Democratic leaders - with newfound leverage from a Senate seat gained in the recent Alabama special election - have said that the budget and DACA protections are linked.  On January 11, a bipartisan group of legislators announced they reached a deal on DACA protections, the US president rejected it and his congressional liaison Marc Short said, \\\"There's still a ways to go.\\\"\\\\xa0  Trump is pushing for increased border security, an end to both \\\"chain migration\\\" - a process that allows immigrants to apply for their family to come to the US - and the [diversity visa programme](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/diversity-visa-recipients- programme-stay-171114094555506.html) that allows for people from countries with a small presence in the US to apply for visas.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/16/f25278f2af72400c8766d5ababc0536f_18.jpg)  ---  Trump said he would end DACA unless legislators could agree on legislation that would increase immigration enforcement [Joe Penney/Reuters]     The Trump administration has also said it was ending \\\"Temporary Protected Status\\\" (TPS) for Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador.\\\\xa0  TPS grants individuals fleeing specific crises, like natural disasters or conflict, visas to live and work in the US. The move to end the status for the three countries affects hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom say they fear to return to their home countries.\\\\xa0  Democrats, during negotiations with Trump and congressional Republicans on continued protections for Dreamers, reportedly offered an end to the diversity visa programme in exchange for continuing the TPS programme.  These negotiations prompted the now infamous\\\\xa0[comments from Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/donald-trump-denies-derogatory- country-remarks-180113100249229.html), in which the US president reportedly questioned why the US should take immigrants from \\\"shithole countries\\\" like El Salvador, Haiti and some African countries.\\\\xa0  The fallout, including renewed accusations of [racism](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/racism.html) on the part of the president, have prompted Trump to say a DACA deal is unlikely.  Even if it does happen, \\\"Trump is asking undocumented young people to make a deal with the devil: Protect their futures in exchange for sacrificing their parents and other community members by supporting increased funding and resources for detention, deportation, and border militarisation,\\\" Alisa Wellek, the executive director of the Immigrants Defense Project, told Al Jazeera.  The idea of being leveraged to further militarise the US border and stop other immigrants from coming to the US doesn't sit well with many Dreamers, including Belman, who remembered his father being detained by immigration authorities.  But Belman said he's optimistic: \\\"It won't be a one-party solution. Both parties can be doing more and supporting these efforts. I'm hopeful that something positive is going to come out of the talks.\\\"  > \\\"Trump is asking undocumented young people to make a deal with the devil: Protect their futures in exchange for sacrificing their parents and other community members by supporting increased funding and resources for detention, deportation, and border militarisation.\\\"\\\\r > > Alisa Wellek, executive director of the Immigrants Defense Project > >   Reflecting on a year of Trump's presidency, Quinonez explained that many felt a sense of complacency before the election, even though DACA was a temporary solution. \\\"We should have prepared more.\\\"  Quinonez said he hopes Trump's first year is a wake-up call for those who aren't yet involved with the pro-immigrant movement. It's imperative for activists and citizens to keep pressuring the Democrats, who haven't always supported their cause as strongly as they could, Quinonez said.  \\\"We're fully aware that 2018 is an election year,\\\" Quinonez said, referring to 2018 midterm elections that could see Democrats making gains over Republicans after a routing in the 2016 elections.  The Dreamer movement is mobilised and holds sway in progressive communities across the US, the activist warned.  Democrats \\\"will feel the consequences if they don't do more\\\" for immigrants, Quinonez concluded.\\\\xa0   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/1/16/621800a4eb8941afb7931d979feba6c1_6.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     _This article is part of a multipart series examining the[State of America Under Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/180115070410554.html).

She also said that she was afraid that the situation might get worse with a parliamentary vote coming up to establish the board of Czech Television. Currently, Babis' ANO party has minority control of the Czech parliament.  \\\"It's similar to Poland or Hungary where the government quite easily can control their television, and it is not independent any more,\\\" she said.   ![](/mritems/Images/2018/3/15/43cd375af6ce4898aa2c96a8cef8ec50_18.jpg)  ---  Zeman was re-inaugurated earlier in March [David W Cerny/Reuters]    ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Thousands rally against Czech president's attack on media\", \n         \"url\": \"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/thousands-rally-czech-president-attack-media-180315062503284.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Human rights groups have condemned the Algerian police for violently dispersing a sit-in organised by resident doctors in Algiers, who have been protesting for weeks over poor working conditions.

There are now 2,043 billionaires worldwide - 90 percent of which are men - the report, based on data from Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Databook for 2017, said.  Tax evasion, erosion of workers' rights and automation are responsible for the world's economic inequality, according to Oxfam.  The organisation has called for greater redistribution of wealth through the use of taxation and public spending programmes by governments worldwide, the elimination of the gender pay gap and a focus on 'living wages' rather than minimum wages.   'Demonising capitalism'  Critics, however, have accused Oxfam of being \\\"obsessed with the rich, rather than concerned with the poor\\\" following publication of the report.  \\\"Demonising capitalism may be fashionable in the affluent Western world but it ignores the millions of people who have risen out of poverty as a result of free markets,\\\" Mark Littlewood, director general at the UK-based Institute of Economic Affairs, said in a statement on Monday.  \\\"Richer people are already highly taxed people 3 reducing their wealth beyond a certain point won't lead to redistribution, it will destroy it to the benefit of no one,\\\" he said.

Let us go back to the roots. Complaining and blaming others is useless. This is the time to act, not to talk. Let us do just that. **\\\\xa0** \\\\xa0   **Rallying the people \\\\xa0  ** _Lamis Andoni - writer and journalist based in Amman, Jordan._  ---    The immediate task ahead is to unify the Palestinian people, inside Palestine and in the diaspora, against US President Donald Trump's so-called \\\"deal of the century\\\" that is swiftly unfolding before our eyes. Trump's deal is nothing more than another attempt to legitimise Israeli control over all Palestinian territories and delegitimise the Palestinian people's historic, national and legal rights - especially the right of return.\\\\xa0  We should not focus on whether we want a two-state or one-state solution. Instead, we need to focus on uniting Palestinians around the goal of freeing Palestine by dismantling the Zionist colonial project that employs brutal methods to keep them under control, including apartheid and ethnic cleansing.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/16/83433fa6ae544d58b85ab8698d3cd194_6.jpeg)  ---  \\\\xa0     We cannot ignore the urgency of the reconstruction of the PLO. The Israeli and US governments have been bent on its destruction, and they are being successful. Let us work towards its revival on a wider, more inclusive basis, and its transformation into a body that represents all Palestinians. We should also not accept the criminalisation of armed resistance.\\\\xa0  The [Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/boycott- divestment-sanctions-bds-170110165203991.html) (BDS) movement is a crucial tool in this struggle, but it cannot be the only form of resistance. We must take Israeli officials to the International Court of Justice and try them for war crimes. We need to delegitimise the occupation and all its practices, challenge the US at the UN Security Council and use all legal tools to resist Israeli and US pressure.  But first, we must halt our heavy reliance on foreign aid, particularly US aid, which is being used to tame the NGOs and maintain the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a policeman for the Israelis.   **Defeating Zionism \\\\xa0  ** _Mazin Qumsiyeh - West-Bank-based author, scientist and director of the Palestine Museum of Natural History._  ---    Someone once told me that \\\"we are kicking the dead horse of a two-state solution\\\". I explained that this was an \\\"illusionary\\\" horse invented by David Ben-Gurion in the 1920s for propaganda purposes. I believe there are only three possible scenarios for the anti-colonial struggle: \\\\xa0  1 - The Algerian model, which is very costly, rarely successful and unlikely to be implemented in Palestine.\\\\xa0   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/16/2ccac323f198448688d96f1c6d0b6edc_6.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     2 - The Australian model, which is a relative win for the colonisers. This model also comes at great cost - in Australia's case - genocide of the native population.\\\\xa0  3 - The \\\"rest of the world\\\" model which was successful in South America, Central America, Canada, South East Asia and South Africa. In this model, one shared country is created for all the peoples of the land after ending colonialism.  Only the third model can be implemented in Palestine and has the capacity to bring an end to Zionist oppression.  I am very optimistic that Zionism will end. We, 12 million Palestinians and millions of others, will make sure this happens sooner than expected.  It is time to reclaim the liberation struggle from those who hijacked it. _ _\\\\xa0_ _ \\\\xa0   **Resurrecting the PLO \\\\xa0  ** _Samaa Abu Sharar - journalist and activist based in Beirut, Lebanon._  ---    Palestinians everywhere should adopt a new approach to give more honour to their cause. They should:  1 - Unite all Palestinian think tanks under one umbrella to assess, evaluate and draw up a new strategy capable of dealing with the current Palestinian situation.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/17/679a5ff9304d47d28595d5e4bda44387_6.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     2 - Dismantle the Palestinian Authority and revoke the Oslo Accords.\\\\xa0  3 - Elect an alternative young leadership under the PLO, representing Palestinians everywhere, capable of uniting Palestinians and working towards a one-state solution with equal rights for Palestinians.  4 - Encourage all forms of resistance in occupied Palestine including armed resistance (which is consistent with international law) until the demise of the occupation.  5 - Mobilise affluent Palestinians abroad to establish a support system on the moral and financial level for Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories, including [Jerusalem](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/jerusalem.html), and refugees abroad.   **'A third Intifada is a must' \\\\xa0  ** _Ibrahim Sa'ad - writer and academic based in the UK._ \\\\xa0  ---    \\\"The game has changed\\\", PA official Saeb Erekat said.

I realise that this act may create mayhem - particularly when a third Intifada is about to materialise - but it must be done.  Also, the Israelis should suffer the sour consequences of their actions if they refuse to adapt to the one-state-solution.\\\\xa0  A third Intifada is a must.

This single act has reignited distrust and condemnation from every corner of the globe, brought violence back to the streets of Palestine, and left the door wide open for other regional players, like Turkey and Iran, to fill the policy vacuum.  On the other hand, as a Palestinian, I see Trump's declaration as a confirmation of what Palestinians have been saying for decades: the US is on the wrong side of this conflict, and has been for 70 years. The opportunity that Trump has provided is for the world to finally act to hold Israel accountable.\\\\xa0  Palestinians have shown tremendous political maturity in all of this by not knee-jerking away from their internationally aligned strategy for freedom and independence in the State of Palestine.\\\\xa0   **Yes to popular resistance, no to political elitism \\\\xa0  ** _Yousef M Aljamal - Palestinian PhD candidate at the University of Sakarya, Middle East Institute, Turkey._  ---    The Palestinian people should adopt a\\\\xa0three-level approach:   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/18/b8ef623392d743f28935e4339082a6f8_18.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     1 - The Palestinian strategy now should be based on building a unified Palestinian front, which reflects the aspirations of Palestinians. This front should not include elites who were part of the previous period because they proved to be a big disappointment to our people. This front should represent all Palestinians everywhere.  2 - Palestinians must cease calling for a two-state solution. Instead, they should adopt a new strategy based on gaining equal rights at home and punishing Israel internationally by intensifying the BDS movement's campaign, which has proven effective in the past 10 years.  3 -\\\\xa0 Palestinians should start a large-scale popular resistance movement against the Israeli occupation by building on the support Palestine has gained globally in order to hold Israel accountable for its crimes against the Palestinian people.\\\\xa0   **International intifada \\\\xa0  ** _Iyad Burnat - the head of the Popular Committee against the Wall in\\\\xa0Bil'in village, West Bank._  ---    Today what people refer to as \\\"Trump's plan\\\" is not Trump's plan at all.

In my view, the only way out of this crisis is to abolish the PA and to establish a unified national leadership that includes all factions of the resistance and the grassroots. Such a leadership can organise a popular Intifada that would attract the attention and support of a large number of people around the world - an international Intifada!\\\\xa0  The end goal for the Palestinian cause should be a single, democratic state where all live in freedom, justice, and equality - a place that exiled Palestinians can also return to. In other words, the answer is a post-Zionist Palestine where Muslims, Christians, and Jews can live in harmony, security and peace.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0   **Full steam ahead with BDS \\\\xa0  ** _Randa Abdel-Fattah - academic at Macquarie University, Australia._  ---     ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/17/c6f23b6213e64f03ae01db3f8205f349_6.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     The global rise of far-right, populist racism, coupled with Trump's indisputable exposure of US bias, offers us an opportunity to reaffirm that our liberation cause is not \\\"too complicated\\\" but is very clearly an anti- racist, anti-colonialist and anti-apartheid one.\\\\xa0  I, therefore, believe we must go full steam ahead with the BDS movement, specifically forcing dramatic changes in Israel's international economic/trade relations.  Academic and cultural boycotts lay the groundwork for promoting public opinion and action in favour of isolating Israel.  Ultimately, we need to \\\"follow the money\\\". By mobilising a critical mass of support from global civil society, especially in western countries collaborating with Israel (such as my country Australia), we can press for economic sanctions and divestment.   **'Un-participate' \\\\xa0  ** _Haidar Eid - one-state activist and Associate Professor at Al-Aqsa University, Gaza._  ---    I think a completely new strategy is needed, one that breaks away from the existing political system, including the \\\"Oslo-ised\\\" and \\\"NGO-ised\\\" opposition.

Otherwise, we will continue to face a very limited set of options - each worse than the other and none realising Palestinian self-determination and rights. One of those limited options is the racist two-state solution that has, ironically, almost managed to gain a consensus from the existing political parties.\\\\xa0  Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, followed by the Likud party's endorsement of a resolution to annex most of the [West Bank](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/occupied-west-bank.html), have only made us realise the facade of the so-called \\\"peace process\\\" and the myth of independence. **\\\\xa0**  Hence, the solution is a complete divorce from the discourse of the racist two-state solution, and the endorsement of a democratic and inclusive one that is based on the universal declaration of human rights, democracy and on our right to self-determination, i.e. a secular, democratic state on the historic land of Palestine, a state for all its citizens regardless of religion, ethnicity, gender, etc.   **Fearing the worst in Gaza \\\\xa0  ** _Rawan Yaghi - Gaza-based writer and University of Oxford alumna._  ---     _![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/17/af542feac34842c3a4b456541956a97e_6.jpg)_  ---  _\\\\xa0_     In [Gaza](http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/gaza.html), we can't even think of a solution to the current crisis. We don't feel that our hardship is being taken seriously. The anticipation of new Israeli military attacks is making an already tense atmosphere even worse. The economic isolation and siege imposed by Israel, the PA and the US leave us fearing the worst.  The Palestinian leadership has lost the trust of Palestinians, whether those living in the Occupied Territories or outside. We need an alternative, an encompassing strategy that includes Palestinians everywhere as the legitimacy of the PA and its political decisions are rightly being questioned.\\\\xa0  Moreover, ongoing efforts to isolate and boycott Israel are not enough. More needs to be done on that front as well.\\\\xa0   **Resistance \\\\xa0  ** _Mohammad Nofal - former political prisoner and retired teacher_  ---    Trump's decision regarding the status of Jerusalem is foolish, to say the least. However, it would have never been possible without the tacit approval of certain Arab countries, the likes of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states. That said, Palestinians, now more than ever before, need to assert their voices.   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/18/e3a7d579183d41c7bf1617df444670e5_18.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     Here in Palestine, we understand that \\\"what is taken by force, can only be redeemed by force\\\", not by a \\\"peace process\\\" that was never genuine in the first place. Israel never fulfilled any of its commitments to previous agreements. In fact, it continued to talk of \\\"peace\\\" while expanding illegal settlements and demolishing Palestinian homes.\\\\xa0  Also, the US was never fair to Palestinians. Its pro-Israel bias has been glaringly clear for many years. Israel has no interest in allowing a Palestinian state, and the US has no desire to push Israel on that front. The only party that continues to speak of a \\\"two-state solution\\\" is the weak Palestinian leadership.  But the Palestinian people are courageous, strong and steadfast and they deserve a leadership that is equally courageous; one that is not afraid to abolish Oslo, cancel its recognition of Israel and, yes, resume all forms of resistance in the West Bank as we did in Gaza. We must end all security coordination with Israel, end the detentions of Palestinians and commit to the national liberation project.\\\\xa0 **\\\\xa0**   **The struggle continues...\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  ** _Ahmad Khaleel Al-Haaj - activist and writer based in Gaza._  ---    A proposed settlement presented by any mediator, in this case, the US, is only a trick to detract us from acting according to this universal law - struggling for a decisive victory.\\\\xa0   ![](/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/Images/2018/1/18/21ca258eba1049f083bfc71f6ce4deb1_18.jpg)  ---  \\\\xa0     Those Palestinians who accepted proposals such as Oslo, incurred - as we can see - shameful successive defeats and made our people pay dearly with loss of lives and possessions, all for naught. Those who stood by Oslo gained high wages for themselves and their families alone.  Yet the enemy could not and will not secure a final and decisive victory. The struggle continues, and it will carry on until we are victorious and until we return to our homeland.

Meanwhile, the ISIL fighters who evaded death or capture have \\\"gone to ground\\\" in rural areas between [Iraq](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html) and [Syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html)\\\\xa0in an effort to regroup and replenish, experts note.  \\\"The Islamic State of today organisationally looks profoundly different to the Islamic State of just a few years ago ... No more does it control a contiguous territory, no more does it have control over urban centres, cities or towns,\\\" said Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London.  \\\"Instead, it appears to have gone to ground, returned to its covert insurgent roots. This means that it's more like an archipelago of all the territories that together still form what it considers to be the Islamic State, what it still considers to be a caliphate,\\\" Winter told Al Jazeera. \\\"But it is no longer operating or able to operate in the same way that it was in 2014 or 2015 or 2016.\\\"   Rise and fall  In January 2014, ISIL, also known as ISIS,\\\\xa0[took Raqqa](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2015/02/rise-fall- isil-150212075706347.html) as its capital, holding the city until Syrian forces reclaimed it late last year. By June of 2014, ISIL had also taken Iraq's second city, Mosul, and held it until Iraqi forces separately [retook](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/post-isil- mosul-170717103412004.html) the eastern and western halves earlier in 2017.  At its peak, ISIL controlled a vast swath of territory that defied the Syria- Iraq border, maintaining key urban strongholds from Fallujah to Tikrit to Aleppo - gains that have all since been reversed.  Last month, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared \\\"the [end of the war](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/iraqi-general-war- isil-171209120757374.html)\\\" against ISIL in his country, announcing that Iraqi forces had secured total control over the Syria-Iraq border. But while battles still [remain to be fought](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/09/mapping-syrias- remaining-battles-170925134709281.html) in both countries, it is highly unlikely that the group could stage a comeback similar to its meteoric rise four years ago, analysts say.  \\\"That moment was a unique one in terms of the circumstances that gave rise to it: the chaos of the Syrian civil war, free access to the borders with [Turkey](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html), streams of foreign fighters coming in, etcetera,\\\" Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a research fellow at the Middle East Forum, told Al Jazeera.  And while some of the conditions that facilitated the group's rise remain in place, ISIL's resources have been significantly depleted in the intervening years.       ---   WATCH: Is ISIL finished for good?     Although the group has managed to maintain a governance project in certain areas, such as through its affiliate Jaysh Khalid bin al-Waleed in Deraa, the group primarily operates as an \\\"insurgency\\\" today, Tamimi noted.  \\\"It's still a major concern in the border areas where, despite claims by both the Syrian government and the US-backed SDF [[Syrian Democratic Forces](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/future-syrian-democratic- forces-171124110417741.html)], the Islamic State still holds some territory in the eastern province of Deir Az Zor and operates relatively freely in the desert borderlands with Iraq,\\\" he said.  According to Colonel Thomas Veale, a spokesperson for the US-led international coalition fighting ISIL, work is ongoing to clear fighters from the areas where they remain, including rural parts of Anbar province and the Middle Euphrates River Valley in Syria.  \\\"The remaining ISIS terrorists are cut off from their leadership and from their logistical support. It is only a matter of time until the SDF and coalition eradicate ISIS from every area within our area of operation,\\\" Veale told Al Jazeera.  Of the estimated 40,000 ISIL fighters believed to be operating in Syria and Iraq at the group's peak in 2015, it is unclear how many remain alive or active, but Veale noted that 98 percent of the more than 100,000 square kilometres of territory the group once controlled has been recaptured. \\\"As the result of our combined effort, the overwhelming majority of ISIS terrorists have been taken off the battlefield,\\\" he said.   Returning fighters  In the meantime, ISIL is continuing to disseminate [propaganda](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2015/02 /provocation-isil-propaganda-150221102306150.html) \\\\- albeit on a more limited scale than in the past - in an effort to assert its continued existence, Winter said. On the group's Telegram channel, photos periodically emerge of fighters hanging out in caves, suggesting they are \\\"biding their time\\\" underground until the group is ready for a resurgence.  \\\"That's essentially what the organisation seems to have called for since the fall of Raqqa,\\\" Winter said.  Also problematic is the issue of ISIL fighters who have fled Syria and Iraq and started returning home.  Turkey, a transit point for many [foreign fighters](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/5600-returned-home-isil-held- areas-171024201252332.html) en route to join ISIL, could also be their path on the way out, putting the country at further risk. In the final days of the battle for Raqqa, it is unclear how many ISIL fighters were smuggled out through this route - and how many among them were still \\\"committed to the cause\\\", Tamimi said.   Foreign fighters didn't just dry up because ... it got difficult to get into Syria from Turkey. They dried up because it became a less appealing thing to join.  Charlie Winter, senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London   ---    Despite the threat of individual attacks, however, the prospect of a large- scale resurgence of foreign ISIL fighters in another country is unlikely, experts say.  \\\"Foreign fighters didn't just dry up because ... it got difficult to get into Syria from Turkey. They dried up because it became a less appealing thing to join,\\\" Winter said. \\\"The Islamic State never had mass appeal, but the appeal that it did have was at its peak in 2014, 2015 and early 2016, when it did look like a successful organisation, when it did look like you could go to join it and not end up having to die in a suicide bomb or after a coalition air strike or something like that. That part of the Islamic State brand no longer exists.\\\"\\\\xa0  Instead, for the time being, ISIL has been encouraging its supporters to launch localised attacks in their home cities and provinces to keep up a global sense of momentum.\\\\xa0   [![](/mritems/Images/2015/9/20/445ed4f604cc49698f3836f370e3bd83_6.png)](https://www.aljazeera.com/curated/)  ---     \\\"The inability to quell the Islamic State as an insurgency problem, even if it fails to regain formal control of territories it lost, [remains] a concern, as in Diyala, and likely the issue will become notable in Nineveh too,\\\" Tamimi said.   Lingering effects  Meanwhile, residents of the areas once controlled by ISIL have been struggling to rebuild their lives. Parents whose young children were trapped under ISIL's rule must grapple with the lingering effects of [indoctrination](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/11/cubs- lions-isil-child-soldiers-171109125013897.html)\\\\xa0or years of missed education. Experts say the full scale of the problem is unknown, as there has been no opportunity yet for an exhaustive assessment.  \\\"There might actually be a lost generation,\\\" Nadim Houry, the director of the terrorism and counterterrorism programme at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.  From the trail of unexploded ordnance left by ISIL, to the razing of entire neighbourhoods in battle, to the lack of basic services such as water and electricity, to the stigmatisation of women who suffered sexual violence under ISIL's rule,\\\\xa0families face myriad challenges in their\\\\xa0[quest to move on](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/iraq-isil-ghost- town-171201115149325.html).  \\\"There is a real crisis today ... of sort of what is the broader strategy, the broader plan,\\\" Houry said, noting that many people \\\"are just still trying to comprehend what happened\\\".  \\\"There are a lot of energetic, well-intentioned people working locally [to rebuild],\\\" he said. \\\"I think what is missing, is there is a lack of international support and international vision for the day after ISIS.

A former international football star, Weah tapped\\\\xa0into a yearning for change and widespread discontent to win\\\\xa0this week's presidential runoff in a landslide.  Boosting the economy will be especially important for the new president, since many of his supporters - young, perennially unemployed or underemployed, and struggling financially - are those most in need of opportunities, said Robtel Neajai Pailey, a Liberian academic.  \\\"You've got a very marginal, small group of people who are doing exceedingly well and then a large majority who are just barely scraping by,\\\"\\\\xa0Pailey told Al Jazeera.  \\\"And that large majority, a large population of that is the under 35-year-olds who showed up in large numbers to elect Weah.\\\"  Weah, who will take office next month, earned 61.5 percent of the December 26 vote. His rival, Vice-President Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party, garnered\\\\xa038.5 percent.  This second round of voting was delayed after a legal challenge, filed by the third-place party, alleged that voter fraud and irregularities had taken place.  But the country's top court ruled it did not have enough evidence of fraud, allowing the runoff to proceed.  Those electoral and judicial processes are a testament to Liberia's \\\"readiness for democratic development\\\" and demonstrate that it is \\\"no longer an international pariah, but ... a country with national institutions that are credible\\\", said\\\\xa0Ibrahim al-Bakri Nyei, a Liberian political analyst.  \\\"We are now being taught that we can take power through the legal processes and by going through electoral [processes] ... not necessarily taking power through the power of the gun,\\\" Nyei told Al Jazeera.   Peaceful transition  Boakai, who served as deputy to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\\\\xa0for 12 years, accepted his loss with grace.  On Friday, he reportedly called Weah to concede defeat after the provisional election results were announced.  In a speech later to his supporters, Boakai said he offered the president- elect\\\\xa0\\\"a hand of goodwill, friendship and gratitude\\\" and urged Liberians \\\"to work even harder to promote reconciliation\\\".  Nyei said Boakai's behaviour was uncommon.  \\\"Boakai is the first presidential candidate ... since the introduction of multiparty democracy who has come out to concede defeat and congratulate his opponent and call for his supporters to rally behind the government,\\\" Nyei said.  \\\"This is a signal that electoral democracy is not a zero-sum game.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2017/12/30/dc5c6c47be2049e799ce7b7cbc4e5c17_18.jpg)  ---  Weah secured 61.5 percent of the vote in a presidential runoff [Thierry Gouegnon/Reuters]     Politics in Liberia, which declared its independence in 1847, were dominated for decades by one-party rule, before a military coup in 1980.  A period of uncertainty followed, eventually leading to back-to-back civil wars between 1989 and 2003 which left an estimated 250,000 people dead and the country's economy and infrastructure in ruins.  This year's elections were the third since the end of the devastating conflict 14 years ago, while Weah's victory marks the first peaceful transition of power in the country since 1944.  Pailey said while \\\"all the signs were pointing\\\" to Weah beating Boakai, the margin by which he won was more surprising than anything else.  In the first round of voting for a new president in October, the results were closer between the top two candidates: Weah earned 38.4 percent of the vote, compared with 28.8 percent for Boakai.  \\\"I think people are just tired of the status quo,\\\" said Pailey. \\\"They're tired of President Sirleaf, they're tired of Joseph Boakai.\\\"  Elected president in 2005, Sirleaf was the first woman to be named head of state in an African country. She served two, six-year terms, the limit under the Liberian constitution.   Economic opportunities  The end of Sirleaf's era finds the country facing several challenges.  Last year, Liberia ranked 177th out of 188 countries on the human development index scale, which measures life expectancy, access to education and standard of living, according to the UN Development Fund.  About 64 percent of Liberians live below the poverty line, and 1.3 million citizens live in extreme poverty, the World Food Programme estimates.  Inflation skyrocketed in recent years and economic mismanagement resulted in massive inflation, while the Ebola crisis of 2014 and 2015 also hit the economy hard.  During his campaign, Weah promised to \\\"create more jobs, provide free education and free healthcare, but there were limited details on how those are going to be achieved\\\", Nyei said.  But despite the often broad, thin-on-details promises, the footballer-turned- politician's\\\\xa0message for change struck a chord with young Liberians who see in his meteoric rise an expression of their dreams for a better future.  For many of his supporters, Pailey said, Weah\\\\xa0\\\"represents their story\\\".   {articleGUID}   The [president-elect](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/george-weah- ghetto-football-star-president-171229094709566.html) grew up in the Clara Town slum in the capital, Monrovia, where he honed his football skills to eventually go on to international sporting stardom.  \\\"The ethos of his winning is that there is hope he will remember those hard times that he spent in Clara Town as a poor aspiring [football] player,\\\" she said.  \\\"People are dancing in the streets because they have this hope that he will level the playing field.\\\"   Divisive figures  Still, Liberia remains a politically and socially fragmented nation,\\\\xa0Pailey said, noting that it will be important to invite \\\"those political forces who were not necessarily huge supporters or die-hard Weah fans\\\" into the political conversation.  But she pointed out that several Sirleaf loyalists have positioned themselves in Weah's camp, which begs the question of \\\"how much change will actually take place in his administration\\\".  Nyei added that members of the country's \\\"old guard\\\" have also appeared close to the president-elect.   {articleGUID}   Weah's running mate, vice-president-elect [Jewel Howard- Taylor](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/jewel-howard-taylor-war-weah- agenda-171203123625177.html), is the ex-wife of former Liberian president and strongman Charles Taylor.  Taylor was a central figure in the country's first and second civil wars, which were waged between 1989 and 1997, and from 1999 to 2003, respectively.  Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Sierra Leone.  Prince Johnson, a notorious Liberian rebel leader turned politician, also backed Weah ahead of the runoff vote. Johnson had previously spoken out against the president-elect, however, telling a Monrovia radio station in September that a Weah victory would send the country \\\"back to war\\\", GNN Liberia reported.  But with many loyal supporters, Johnson's endorsement was ultimately seen as a boost.   Fighting corruption  How the proximity of these divisive figures to a future Weah administration will affect efforts for national reconciliation or calls to root out corruption, remains to be seen, Nyei said.  Lawrence Yealue is a Monrovia-based representative\\\\xa0at Accountability Lab, a group that works on education and community outreach to promote accountability in public office.  He said he remains concerned about what \\\"the beginning of this [Weah] administration is going to look like\\\", especially on the issue of corruption, which he said is a big concern for many Liberians.  \\\"It's a long road, but Liberians are really up for some actions [to be taken] against people who economically have really stolen from this country,\\\" Yealue told Al Jazeera.  He said the country will be closely watching what Weah proposes when he takes office in January.  \\\"How can we start prosecuting people?

Years of social and economic inequality have reportedly pushed tens of thousands across the country to rally over the rising cost of living and against the policies of the system that has ruled [Iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html) for more than three decades.       ---   WATCH: [Iran accuses 'enemies' as US seeks emergency UN session (3:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzlgnkoGZEs)      Experts on the country said it is still heavily reliant on its oil reserves, adding that successive governments have failed to solve institutional problems that have piled up over the years.  These include the lack of foreign investment and the overbearing role of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).  Iran's inflation is at 9.6 percent while its unemployment rate sits at 13 percent.  However, the unofficial rate is estimated to be almost double the formal figure.  For many Iranians, the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which they thought would bring economic relief through the relaxation of internationally imposed sanctions, has failed to deliver the economic benefits it promised.   Failure of nuclear deal  \\\"People predicted that the honey is coming but it was a miscalculation,\\\" Mahjoob Zweiri, a Doha-based professor of contemporary Arab politics,\\\\xa0told Al Jazeera. \\\"They didn't take seriously the impact of Trump's policies \\\\u2026 The whole deal was not beneficial to Iran.\\\"  The landmark nuclear deal came under threat when US President [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html) took office last year.  Trump was a vocal critic of the deal even before he won the presidential race, pledging to change and review much of its content.  In October, he\\\\xa0[refused](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/iran- nuclear-deal-donald-trump-decertifies-2015-pact-171012101055479.html) to certify the deal curtailing Tehran's nuclear programme, accusing the country of violating its provisions.  During the first year of his presidency, Trump [imposed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/house-approves-russia-iran- korea-sanctions-170726043821838.html) two new packages of sanctions on Iran, harming its economy even further.  Trita Parsi, founder and president of the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, said sanctions combined with mismanagement and corruption have taken a toll on Iran's economy.  \\\"The sanctions have definitely created a tremendous amount of economic pain, which worsened the situation,\\\" Parsi told Al Jazeera.  \\\"Sanctions relief has not really worked and has become even more difficult as a result of the Trump administration constantly speculating that they may kill the nuclear deal.\\\"   Inflation, unemployment, lack of investments  However, Trump's threats to the nuclear deal are not solely to blame.  Iran's weary economy has also been damaged by the country's policies that continue to isolate the country internationally.  Zweiri explained that Iran's persisting structural problems lay in legislation, the banking system, Iran's accessibility to the international finance system, and corruption.  With the nuclear deal constantly under threat of revocation, foreign banks that seek to finance investment projects remain hesitant to establish themselves in Iran for fear of sanctions returning.  \\\"All of these structural problems have persisted since the Islamic model came to power in 1980,\\\" Zweiri said.  In the face of mounting economic challenges, the government has increasingly imposed taxes on its citizens.  Last month, Iran's parliament discussed President [Hassan Rouhani](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/hassan-rouhani.html)'s budget bill that plans to increase fuel prices.  Iran's involvement in regional conflicts has also played a role in prompting the latest wave of protests, with citizens accusing the state of misplacing national funds on maintaining the \\\"status quo\\\" in [Syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html), for instance, and [supporting](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/russia-iran-turkey- agree-hold-syrian-congress-171122200119595.html) Syrian President Bashar al- Assad's government.  These reasons have triggered widespread anger over the nation's \\\"mismanaged\\\" funds, says Zweiri.   Reformists vs conservatives  Firas Maksad, director of the US-based Arabia Foundation, said the sense among Iranians was that the billions received after the nuclear deal were not spent on the country, but \\\"were instead spent in funding overseas militias in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon\\\".  According to Maksad, though sparked by social and economic grievances, the ongoing protests quickly turned \\\"political\\\" with calls for toppling Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Rouhani attempted to justify the increase in taxes by citing the \\\"massive entitlement programs of Iran's religious establishment\\\", Maksad said.  \\\"Such embezzlement of public funds, along with greater economic pain, ignited public anger,\\\" he added.  Iran's reformist president Rouhani, who swept into office four years ago on a platform to reduce the country's international isolation, [won](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/iran-election-president-hassan- rouhani-takes-lead-170520042625946.html) a second presidential term in May 2017.  Despite a high voter turnout, up to 30 percent of the population did not take part in the voting process altogether.  According to Parsi, Rouhani won simply because \\\"the alternative was a conservative\\\".       ---   WATCH: [Iran protests: More deaths as Rouhani calls for unity (2:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8lAHXn8nio)      \\\"Many of the people on the streets right now probably didn't vote at all \\\\u2026 because they don't believe that voting is going to bring about change.\\\"  According to analysts, another factor working to the detriment of Iran's economy was the influence of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ([IRGC](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/irans-revolutionary-guard- explained-171014101006193.html)).  Rouhani continues to face resistance from the revolutionary guard whenever he attempts to implement reform.  Those Al Jazeera spoke to said the relationship between Rouhani and the country's religious elite was one dictated by economic power, and that in reality, there is little the president can do to bring about change.   The powerful revolutionary guards  The country has for years relied on the IRGC's local investments to keep the economy afloat.  Because of the sanctions, the government \\\"needs\\\" the IRGC to continue developing major projects, explained Mohammad\\\\xa0Marandi, an academic at the University of Tehran.  \\\"As long as the sanctions remain in place, the private sector is unwilling to develop or to pursue very large projects on their own because of fear of sanctions.\\\"  Established following the 1979 Islamic revolution, the IRGC is a branch of Iran's armed forces that is aimed at protecting the country's Islamic Republic system.  The paramilitary, led by Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is highly influential and deeply involved in the economy.  Zweiri differed with Marandi on whether the IRGC was helping the country or was one of the country's major problems.  \\\"What prevents foreign investments is the involvement of the IRGC, who push parliament into not approving legislation that would ease the process of foreign investments,\\\" Zweiri said.  Last year, in a bid to welcome investments, Rouhani, perceived as a \\\"moderate\\\", was accused by conservatives of promoting \\\"Western values\\\" that are \\\"contradictory\\\" to Islamic principles.  The IRGC's extensive involvement has caused \\\"widespread anger\\\" over the way the guard has monopolised the economy.  According to Parsi, the bulk of Iranians perceive the IRGC as a \\\"mafia that is above the law\\\", responsible for much of the corruption.  Maksaid said as much as half of Iran's gross domestic product (GDP) is currently under the control of Khamenei and the revolutionary guard, including \\\"mammoth conglomerates in strategic sectors\\\".  \\\"In addition, Khamenei and the guards control the guns,\\\" he said, referencing previous waves of protests, which were put down with force.  \\\"The system's inability to implement meaningful reforms is why Iran witnesses social and political unrest every decade, in 1999, in 2009 and now in 2018.\\\"   'Lack of credibility'  The [last](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2009/06/2009615165959764614.html) wave of protests took place in 2009, when many Iranians demonstrated against alleged voting fraud and called for electoral transparency.  The uprising, which lasted for about 7 months, was met with a campaign of arrests and clashes between armed groups and civilians on the streets.  Historically, Iran also saw waves of demonstrations in 1906, 1952, and [1979](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/iran-1979 -revolution-shook-world-2014121134227652609.html).  \\\"So these are waves and the impact of these waves will continue,\\\" Zweiri predicted.  \\\"It is unclear whether [after] this last wave there is still more to come 3 these [protests] are serious as they show that the regime is lacking credibility,\\\" he said  \\\"The regime's discourse is no longer in line with the people.  \\\"A huge gap is getting bigger by day between the regime ... and the people.\\\"       ---   **WATCH:** [Why are people protesting in Iran?

This is going to be a hard task following the ANC's [decisive 54th\\\\xa0conference](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/south-africa- anc-conference-decide-zuma-fate-171212105229665.html) where the party emerged as almost two separate parties.  The ANC under President [Jacob Zuma](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people /jacob-zuma.html), weighted down by corruption, scandals and government failure, have fractured, and lost electoral support in key cities and traditional constituencies. It is in danger of losing the next national elections in just over 12 months.\\\\xa0  At last month's conference, ANC leaders successfully managed to prevent the party from formally splitting into two, following the bruising party leadership contest between Ramaphosa and his losing opponent Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the former African Union head and former wife of South African President Jacob Zuma. In 2018, the big challenge for Ramaphosa and the ANC will be to overcome the deep divisions between these factions.  Differences over whether to get former ANC President and current South African President Jacob Zuma out of the state presidency early in 2018 - as Ramaphosa wants to do - rather than let him complete his term - as the Dlamini-Zuma/Zuma group wants - is going to be the first obstacle the new party leader will be facing in the new year.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Ramaphosa knows that he needs to get rid of President Zuma as quickly as possible, preferably before South Africa's political year starts in February 2018 with the annual State of the Nation address by the state president, if he wants to restore waning public\\\\xa0and investor confidence in the ANC.\\\\xa0Ramaphosa also needs to quickly take full control of the government, appoint his own Cabinet team and introduce his priority policies to restore public and investor confidence ahead of the 2019 elections.\\\\xa0  > Resuscitating South Africa's distressed economy should be another priority for Ramaphosa if he wants to restore the ANC's fortunes.\\\\r > > \\\\xa0 > >   However, because the pro-Zuma group has such a powerful grip on the ANC, Ramaphosa would not be able to fire Zuma immediately, but will have to negotiate an exit settlement, which may be protracted, as Zuma and his allies may want to secure safeguard guarantees. Furthermore, Dlamini-Zuma allies, given their strength, may demand they co-govern with Ramaphosa - meaning sharing appointments to Cabinet, government and state-owned companies. This may force Ramaphosa to appoint incompetent Dlamini-Zuma allies to key positions to maintain party unity, which may undermine his reform agenda.  If he wants to\\\\xa0win back the declining support for the ANC,\\\\xa0Ramaphosa needs to be seen tackling rampant corruption in 2018. However, he is likely to find this difficult to achieve without facing fierce resistance from Zuma and his allies. This may even cause the party to split in two, as Zuma allies still control at least half of the party.\\\\xa0  The very first priority for the ANC will be to institute a commission of inquiry to investigate corruption, following a recommendation late last year by former South African Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. President Zuma has previously promised to do so, but has delayed setting it up.\\\\xa0  What the commission of inquiry into state capture, if set-up in 2018, will investigate, will also determine whether the ANC will enter the 2019 elections even more divided than it is now. It is very likely that in order to unify the factions, party leaders from both groups will try to make the terms of reference of the commission as wide as possible, to also include corruption among South Africa's white business community.\\\\xa0This would give President Zuma a \\\"dignified\\\" way out of the myriad corruption probes currently involving him.  Resuscitating South Africa's distressed economy should be another priority for Ramaphosa if he wants to restore the ANC's fortunes. The country's economy plunged into recession in the first quarter of 2017, with some global rating agencies having assigned it junk status. Unemployment is now close to 30 percent.  In 2018, Ramaphosa is likely to try to build a social partnership between government, business and trade unions, where each of the groups agree on a set of minimum obligations that would boost investor confidence. This is likely to be based on the blueprint created early last year, when Ramaphosa managed to unite business, labour and government to agree on a minimum wage.\\\\xa0  However, it may be more difficult for Ramaphosa to convince ANC's two main competing factions to agree on policies, as it is clear that Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma/Zuma camps already differ deeply over core policies.  For example, at the ANC's conference, the two groups clashed over a proposal to amend the constitution to allow expropriation of land without compensation. The dispute almost caused the collapse of the ANC conference. Pro-Ramaphosa groups rejected it, but it was eventually carried forward with the support of pro-Zuma/Dlamini-Zuma groups.  Although Ramaphosa at the end of the conference endorsed the expropriation of land without compensation - to honour the ANC conference resolution - many of his own supporters still believe that such an approach will undermine investor confidence, desperately needed to create jobs.\\\\xa0Just a few months ago the ANC rejected a call by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to amend the constitution to allow for this kind of expropriation of land without compensation.  To amend the constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation before the 2019 national elections, will need a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. Even if the EFF vote with the ANC to help secure such a two-thirds majority, a vote is likely to split ANC MPs, as many pro- Ramaphosa MPs still oppose the measure. This means that the ANC may fail to secure the necessary two-thirds majority even with the EFF's support.  Another 2018 battle between the Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma/Zuma group will be over education. A day before the ANC conference, in an attempt to boost Dlamini-Zuma's presidential campaign, Jacob Zuma proposed to make higher education free for poor and working-class students.\\\\xa0The conference endorsed Zuma's proposal, resolving that this measure must be \\\"speedily\\\" implemented. A special commission appointed by Zuma last year to investigate whether free higher education was financially feasible ahead of the conference said it was not viable at this moment and proposing alternative models should be investigated.\\\\xa0  The National Treasury has said the proposal would be financially impractical right now, given the lack of public resources available, drop in tax revenue and public sector belt-tightening measures that were recently introduced. The Dlamini-Zuma/Zuma group would want to get the no-fee proposal implemented before the 2019 elections because it is a potential vote spinner among the poor - they would not care whether it undermines public finances and investor confidence.  This year, in order to maintain the unity of the ANC and to make sure that the party enters the 2019 national elections as a single body, Ramaphosa may need to slow down the organisational renewal of the ANC and the implementation of reforms that would tackle corruption and increase investor confidence in the party.   ** _The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy._** ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"A tough year ahead for South Africa's ANC\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/tough-year-south-africa-anc-180105091421831.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html) unveiled a union budget on Thursday that the government claimed aims to help farmers and the rural economy.

Highlights of India's 2018/2019 budget    * The government [estimates](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/india-wealth-inequality-growing-rapidly-180125084201143.html) 7.2\\\\xa0 to 7.5 percent GDP growth in second half of current fiscal year   * GDP growth for 2017/18 is estimated at 6.7 percent   * Faster GDP growth could ease pressure on the Central Bank to lower borrowing costs   * The government projects a 2018/19 fiscal deficit (fiscal deficit is the difference between the government's expenditures and its revenues, excluding money it borrowed) at 3.3 percent of GDP   * The 2017/18 fiscal deficit estimate is maintained at 3.5 percent of GDP   Speaking to Al Jazeera, economist and former adviser to the Indian finance ministry, Mohan Guruswamy, said: \\\"The budget does not address any real issues. It's smart packaging ahead of next year's elections. The GDP figures are over- estimated. GDP is not going to grow more than 6.5 percent this year.  \\\"With growth returning to Western nations; Europe, US and China are all returning to growth - oil offtake and prices will go up. When oil prices go up, in turn, trade deficit will widen.  \\\"This is an election year. Modi is trying to placate as many people as he can. This is a fiscally prudent budget. But the options are limited. If all else fails, they will return to flag-waving nationalism,\\\" he added, referring to the groundswell of religious nationalism in India following the coronation of Prime Minister Modi in 2014.  However, economist Prasenjit Bose told Al Jazeera that revenue estimates in the budget are \\\"unrealistic\\\" and expenditure claims are \\\"misleading\\\".  \\\"There's a lot of rhetoric on expenditure which is not backed up by actual outlay,\\\" Bose said.  \\\"The government has missed the fiscal deficit target, showing it was way off the mark. The estimate of GST (a new unified sales tax) collection for next fiscal year is supposed to increase by 3 trillion rupees. I am really sceptical about this. I don't see that kind of jump in revenue collection happening for the central government,\\\" he added.   Agriculture  Finance Minister Jaitley on Thursday also announced that the minimum support price (the government's assured purchase prices) of all farm produce would be increased to at least 1.5 times that of production cost.  Higher prices for their produce has been the subject of vocal protests by farmers groups in recent months. Thousands of farmers protested in Delhi in November, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts.  \\\"There is hardly any increase in rural spending in the aggregate - all talk no money,\\\" said economist Jayati Ghosh.  The budget allocated a 10 to 11 trillion rupee credit for \\\"agricultural activities\\\".  The government reiterated that it \\\"seeks to double farmers' income by 2022\\\" and will give 100 percent tax deductions for the first five years to companies registered as farmer producer companies with a turnover of 1bn rupees and above, the finance minister said.  India produced over 275 million tonnes of food grains and 300 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables in 2016-17.   Infrastructure  The budget allocates 5.97 trillion rupees for infrastructure and extra budgetary allocation in 2018/19.  Last year's budget allocated 3.96 trillion rupees for infrastructure.  The government announced it aims to spend ($225bn) on creation of rural infrastructure.   Health and education  The government has estimated a 1.38 trillion rupee expenditure on health, education and social security for 2018/19.  In an ambitious move, the government announced it would launch a national health protection scheme to protect 100 million families by providing coverage of up to 500,000 rupees per family per year.  India's under-served poor have limited access to quality healthcare; a vast majority depend on the state for affordable medical services.  Last year, the government set a target of raising annual health spending to 2.5 percent of India 9s GDP by 2025 - from 1.15 percent now, one of the lowest percentages in the world.  \\\"A mere 11.5 percent increase in budgetary allocations for health is disappointing and discouraging especially with the announcement of schemes that require large sums of money. The budgetary allocations are clearly mismatched with the stated policies goals despite the political commitment to increase investments in health,\\\" Poonam Muttreja, executive director of Population Foundation of India, told Al Jazeera.  \\\"The continuing trend in lower budgetary allocations for health reinforce the fact that, while there is the intention and attempt to improve the health status in the country, the financial commitment continues to be missing for translating these goals into action,\\\" she added.  A 2015 UNICEF report said that around 1.2 million children in India died of preventable diseases before turning five.  \\\"I am not convinced that this is a good response to the niggardly spending on health, among the lowest in the world. We know from the US experience that private health insurance is a bad idea. If this is like the earlier health scheme RSBY in India, there is some evidence that it benefited insurance companies and private hospitals more than the poor,\\\" Reetika Khera, economics professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi told Al Jazeera.  The government also announced it would invest 1 trillion rupees in the development of premium education infrastructure over next four years.   Defence  New Delhi is in the midst of a whopping $250bn military modernisation programme.  The budget for defence in 2018/2019 will be 2.83 trillion rupees, compared to an estimated defence expenditure, excluding pensions, of 2.74 trillion rupees last year.  The government will bring in an industry-friendly defence production policy in 2018/19, the finance minister said in his budget speech on Thursday.  The Modi government 9s much-hyped push to expand the domestic defence industry aims at ending India's status as the world's largest arms importer. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"India budget focuses on rural areas ahead of election\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/india-budget-focuses-rural-areas-election-180201141734872.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ President [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile- president-donald-trump-161109050153947.html) has blocked the $117bn takeover of chip maker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom.

Ziyad Abdul Malik, chairman of the Muslim Students Association's (HMI) branch in South Jakarta, lambasted the kingdom for using the pilgrimage to Mecca, considered Islam's holiest city, to impose its policies on other Gulf nations and Muslim-majority countries.  HMI, the largest student group in Indonesia, organised the event - dubbed \\\"Islamic Holy Places for All of the Ummah\\\"- at the Indonesia University in Depok.  Malik went on to accuse Saudi Arabia of interference in the conference itself. The event was originally slated to take place at the State Islamic University in Jakarta, located in the Indonesian capital, but it was cancelled at the request of the Saudi embassy.  \\\"We are students, and students usually discuss many things,\\\" he said. \\\"Why is this a problem for [Saudi Arabia]?\\\"   {articleGUID}   Other organisers echoed Malik's criticisms, arguing that Saudi Arabia had let political rows with several countries - Qatar, Syria, Iran and Yemen, among others - influence its Hajj regulations.   'Only God has the right'\\\\xa0  Representatives of Garda Suci Merah Putih (GSMP), another organisation that participated in the conference, argued that Saudi Arabia had violated the conditions of its role as custodian of the Islamic faith's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.  \\\"Only God has the right to forbid anyone to go on Hajj, not Saudi Arabia,\\\" Mujtahid Hasheem, secretary-general of GSMP, told Al Jazeera.  Hasheem alluded to the example of Syrian pilgrims, who must go through a committee that is controlled by Saudi-backed opposition groups to obtain visas for the religious journey.  Saudi Arabia severed its diplomatic ties with the Syrian government in 2012 owing to the ongoing civil war in that country.  In Yemen, Hasheem noted, Saudi had taken similar measures, politicising Hajj access based on the country's alliances.  Saudi Arabia has backed the government in Yemen and has led a coalition of Arab-majority countries in war against opposition groups, such as the Houthi rebels.  Hasheem added that restrictions on citizens of Qatar - which has been blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others since the summer of 2017 - was further evidence of the kingdom's wrongdoing.  The pilgrimage is a religious requirement for all able-bodied Muslims who have the financial means to carry out the journey, according to religious guidelines.  Explaining that Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world, Hasheem argued that Indonesians play an important role in ensuring that Hajj access conforms with religious guidelines.  Officials should urge Saudi Arabia to abandon restrictions on the right to worship, Hasheem said.  In 2017, an estimated 221,000 Indonesians performed Hajj, he said.  Shujaat Ali, general secretary of the Muslim Student Organisation of India, accused Saudi Arabia of destroying famous religious sites, such as the birthplace of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.  Ali cited statistics from the Washington, DC-based Gulf Institute, which estimates that 95 percent of Mecca's famous buildings have been destroyed in the past two decades.   {articleGUID}   \\\"What are there now?

The organisers added that they intend to host another international conference in the future to discuss the establishment of an international body to manage Hajj.  \\\"We will invite international scholars and ulemas [a body of religious scholars], and we will even invite Saudi Arabia to join,\\\" the GSMP's Hasheem added. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Indonesian youth: Saudi Arabia has 'politicised' Hajj\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/indonesian-youth-saudi-arabia-politicised-hajj-180126101604918.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Seun Adigun and fellow former runners Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga will represent their nation as the first-ever Nigerian bobsled team in next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

When Wimbledon agreed to offer equal prize-money a decade ago, only nine out of the 44 sports which remunerate athletes paid equally. That number is now 35.  However, the remaining nine are among the biggest and most lucrative in the world: Football, golf and cricket among them.  Serena Williams is the [only female](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/06/15/full-list-the- worlds-highest-paid-athletes-2017/4f8507afd583) in the world's 100 highest- paid athletes. Recent studies suggested gender equality in football is worse than in politics, business and medicine.  Even in tennis, away from the Grand Slams, the gap remains considerable.  Earlier this month, Nick Kyrgios pocketed $83,650 for winning the Brisbane International. Julia Goerges, meanwhile, earned $43,000 for winning a similar- level event in Auckland.  Adding endorsements, the gulf widens. World's top-ranked female tennis player Simona Halep's off-court earnings came in at $1.5m last year, dwarfed by Roger Federer, currently men's number two, who pocketed $58m.  This month, Novak Djokovic urged male tennis players to demand more prize- money.  Last year, Djokovic said male players should earn more than their female counterparts because they have a bigger following.  FIFA, football's world governing body, awarded a total prize pool of $15m for the last Women's World Cup. For the men's equivalent, the pool was $576m.  In golf, the men's world number 143, Mackenzie Hughes, earned more in 2017 ($2.36m) than the women's number two Sung Hyun Park ($2.34m).  The 2017 earnings of top-ranked golfer Dustin Johnson's caddie surpassed all but three of the top female golfers.  \\\"It's important to understand that the money doesn't come from how well the players hit the five-iron or how accurate their putting is,\\\" Mark Lichtenhein, chairman of the Ladies European Tour, told Al Jazeera.\\\\xa0   {articleGUID}   \\\"It comes from how well the events are packaged and marketed as a product. Too many women's sports are trying to compete with men's sports on men's terms. They're chasing after the same sponsors and the same TV channels.  \\\"Because of the male-biased demographics of those channels, they don't necessarily get the same viewing figures, creating a perception that the audience isn't there for women's sports and that it's just an add-on to the men's game.\\\"  Almost 99 percent of all sponsorship money - the amount that dictates footballers' salaries and the prize pool for tennis and golf events - is directed at men's sport. Golf executives believe the women's game has struggled to attract an even share because their tournaments are often billed as space-fillers in the broadcasting schedules between men's tournaments.  Lichtenhein believes one of the key ways to increase the amount of money available to female athletes is to reach out to different TV channels and online streaming platforms not traditionally associated with sport.  \\\"We're seeing some progress. A lot of sponsors are beginning to realise that for a relatively low price, you can reach a pretty good demographic of women, and that targeting women is perhaps more cost-effective given that women make the majority of household purchasing decisions.\\\"   Merging tournaments  Squash, meanwhile, has made substantial breakthroughs in gender equality, offering equal prize-money for the first time at the 2017 World Championships and at five of the seven elite World Series tournaments.  \\\"We managed it by merging the men's and women's tours,\\\" Professional Squash Association Chief Executive Alex Gough told Al Jazeera.  \\\"This allowed us to hold both events at the same location, market them to TV and sponsors as the same package, much like the Grand Slams in tennis, and then offer the same prize-money.\\\"  The European Championships at Gleneagles this year will be the first mixed golf event, held on the same course with equal prize-money.

However in Europe, home of the game's major club leagues, the gulf in pay is huge.  Didulica believes responsibility lies on national federations to invest more and close that gap.  \\\"At the moment, women's football is in an investment phase,\\\" Didulica said.\\\\xa0  > A lot of sponsors are beginning to realise that for a relatively low price, you can reach a pretty good demographic of women\\\\r > > Mark Lichtenhein, chairman of the Ladies European Tour > >   \\\"We can't expect it to generate the same sponsor and TV value as the men's game without first investing money to allow it to catch up commercially and in terms of quality.

Until recently, women were vulnerable to various types of violence in private and public spheres, including rape, sexual harassment and domestic abuse.  Much of this abuse had gone unreported, with such incidents considered private matters and not criminal.  In a bill approved by parliament on February 14 after years of debate among political parties, civil and women's rights groups, the new law defines violence against women as \\\"any act based on gender discrimination that entails physical, psychological, sexual, or economic harm to a woman. It also criminalises cyber harassment and forced marriage\\\".  The new law imposes tougher penalties on perpetrators, including prison terms ranging from one month to five years and fines from $200 to $1,000.  The law, however, does not explicitly outlaw marital rape or spousal violence and does not provide a precise definition of domestic violence.   Domestic violence  Bassima Hakkaoui, minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development, praised the bill as defining call kinds of violence against women, offers preventive and protection measures and increases penalties for people who commit violent acts against women.  Human Rights Watch said the law includes positive provisions, but leaves women at risk of being abused in a marriage.  \\\"The law allows for protection orders that prohibit an accused person from contacting, approaching, or communicating with the victim,\\\" the rights group said. \\\"But these can only be issued during a criminal prosecution or after a criminal conviction. Moreover, the orders can be cancelled if spouses reconcile which will only add more pressure on women to drop such orders.\\\"  In 2009, in a survey of 8,300 women, 62.8 percent said they had been subject to psychological, physical, sexual or economical violence, according to High Planning Commission (HCP), an independent government statistical institution.\\\\xa0  > The main problem of the new law is the way it defines abuses. Articles of the law lack clarity and are not as precise as international norms.\\\\r > > Hayat Ndichi, activist > >   Miloud Kaouass, professor of Islamic studies at Ibn Tofail University in the city of Kenitra, applauded the law, but stressed the importance of raising awareness for such a move to be effective.  \\\"The law is good but we need to enhance the importance of moral values and manners among our youths both in school and at home. As long as we get away from ethics, morality and manners, violence and harassment against women would never stop.\\\\xa0  \\\"Teaching our youth Islamic values will also help. Islam considers even looks with some kind of sexual attraction as harassment,\\\" Kaouass told Al Jazeera.  Kaouass claimed it would be difficult for the new law to address claims of violence by married women against husbands, saying loopholes in the legislation could lead to false accusations.  \\\"A relationship between a husband and wife is supposed to be based on love and consent. In the case of a married couple, it is difficult to differentiate if the relationship was with or without consent,\\\" he said.  Hayat Ndichi, a member of the Aspiration Feminine NGO, said the law lacks clarity, which in turn would not deter molestation or limit violence.  \\\"The main problem of the new law is the way it defines abuses. Articles of the law lack clarity and are not as precise as international norms. This means opening the door for many legal loopholes and interpretations,\\\" she told Al Jazeera, adding conjugal rape had been ignored.  However, she praised the bill for getting tough on perpetrators and including cybercrimes.   'I didn't know what to do.

Who are the protesters and what are their demands? What will it take to appease people in the streets?\\\\xa0   The protests  Mass protests erupted in Ethiopia's populous Oromia region - home to the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethno-national group - in 2015 after a master plan was unveiled to expand the boundaries of the capital, Addis Ababa.  The concern among local farmers at the time was that the city would confiscate their lands and leave them without a source of livelihood and with nowhere to go.   {articleGUID}   The Oromo protesters' first demand, therefore, was to cancel the master plan outright, explained Felix Horne, a researcher at [Human Rights Watch](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/human-rights- watch.html).  But their demands quickly grew to include the release of prisoners of conscience and more political and socioeconomic rights for the Oromo, who make up more than 34 percent of the country's 100 million citizens and have long complained of being marginalised.  Angered by an unfulfilled demand to retake control of some of their lands, the Amhara - Ethiopia's second-largest ethnic group, constituting about 27 percent of the population - launched protests in their region soon thereafter.  The Amhara people quickly raised another issue at their rallies, Horne explained: \\\"the disproportionate economic and diplomatic power\\\" of the most dominant party in the ruling coalition, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF).  The TPLF is one of four\\\\xa0political parties in the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which controls all 547 seats in Ethiopia's parliament.  The other parties are the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organisation (OPDO), and the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM).  Tigrayans make up about six percent of Ethiopia's population, but hold influential positions in the fields of government, economics and security, among others. The country's former prime minister,\\\\xa0Meles Zenawi, chaired the TPLF before his death in 2012.       ---   [INSIDE STORY: What triggered unrest in Ethiopia? (24:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEqNDGoXpM)      Very rapidly after the outbreak of the protests, \\\"all of the underlying grievances about a lack of political space, a lack of ability to express dissent, came to the forefront\\\",\\\\xa0Horne told Al Jazeera.  \\\"The government, rather than acknowledging this, they just repressed those protesters with brutal force,\\\" he said.  A state of emergency was put in place in 2016 and lifted last August after 10 months. Hundreds of people were killed when state security forces opened fire on protesters, and more than 20,000 people were arrested amid widespread human rights abuses.  But the state's use of violence didn't stem the protests, and many youths were actually emboldened to continue to demand greater political inclusion, Horne said.  This year, mass protests once again broke out in the Oromo and Amhara regions after residents alleged the government was dragging its feet on a promise to release all of Ethiopia's political prisoners. Strikes were also organised to put pressure on\\\\xa0Hailemariam's government.  \\\"Repression is not working, [the government was] not able to instil the same level of fear,\\\" Horne said.   The 'Other'  The Oromo are largely concentrated in Oromia, which is also the country's largest region.  But despite the size of their population and territory, \\\"Ethiopia has for decades marginalised the Oromo from the political and economic benefits of the state\\\", said Etana Habte, a PhD student and teaching fellow at SOAS at the University of London.  The questions being raised today by Oromo protesters are \\\"very much rooted in the history of the country, where Oromo were seen in Ethiopia as its Other\\\", Etana told Al Jazeera.   {articleGUID}   The Oromo have a handful of historical demands that have been amplified since the protests broke out three years ago.  They have called for greater self-rule at the regional level, including the ability to control the lands they live and work on, Etana said, while also demanding the recognition of their ethnic identity and language rights at the national level.  Amharic is Ethiopia's only official working language.  \\\"If you hear the protesters on the street ... [they are saying], 'self-rule for our region, shared rule for Ethiopia,'\\\" Etana said.  \\\"The problem is the government is now dominated by a minority ruling elite coming from the Tigrayan people,\\\" he added, and \\\"if you give self-rule for Oromia, Oromia would take a leading role at the national level... That is the fear of the ruling elite\\\".  While the trigger behind protests in the Oromo and Amhara communities was not the same, solidarity has grown between the two groups, both at the local and federal government levels, said\\\\xa0Fisseha Tekle, a Horn of Africa researcher with [Amnesty International](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations /amnesty-international.html).  \\\"There is an emerging partnership between the people in the regions and the two parties representing the communities\\\" within the\\\\xa0EPRDF coalition, said\\\\xa0Tekle.  He said the protesters' demands have been consistent since the start of the protests and continue in the same vein today: accountability for human rights abuses, the release of political prisoners, political reforms and greater freedoms.  \\\"People are saying that democratic institutions in the country are not reflective of the reality on the ground - and they need a space that allows for every voice to be heard,\\\" Tekle told Al Jazeera.   Succession debate  Hailemariam's resignation has opened up a succession debate within the ruling party ahead of elections scheduled for 2020.  But it is the state of emergency that most concerns groups such as Amnesty International, Tekle said.  \\\"Lifting and suspending rights is not a positive response... The Ethiopian government is still not learning from its past mistakes, but it is trying to quash protests using the usual method, which is force,\\\" he said.  According to Mohammed Ademo, founder and editor of OPride.com, an independent news website on Ethiopia, the ruling coalition must appoint an Oromo politician as prime minister to appease the protesters' demands in the short- term.  \\\"People feel marginalised from the centres of power... They are saying they don't want to continue to be ruled by a minority oligarchy,\\\" Ademo told Al Jazeera.  From the point of view of many protesters, the only suitable candidates to lead Ethiopia out of this volatile situation would be Lemma Megersa, president of the Oromia regional government, or his vice president, Abiy Ahmed, a leading figure in the OPDO, the Oromo party within the coalition.  Both politicians have said \\\"the demands of the protesters for more democracy, for openness, for justice, for opportunity, for jobs \\\\u2026 are valid\\\", Ademo said.  \\\"That's what endears these two leaders to the public [and] to the protesters.\\\"  Whoever becomes prime minister will have to quickly address deeper problems in Ethiopia, however, such as allowing media and non-governmental organisations to operate freely and repealing repressive laws that have been used to criminalise citizens calling for reform, Ademo said.  \\\"Will [appointing an Oromo prime minister] be sufficient? Absolutely not.\\\" ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Ethiopia: Mass protests 'rooted in country's history'\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia-mass-protests-rooted-country-history-180219130441837.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ Ahmed Ech-Chahedy first thought he was hearing fireworks.  The father of six had just finished evening prayers at the Islamic Cultural Centre in Quebec, [Canada](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/canada.html), and was chatting with his eight-year-old son and two of his son's friends.  It was January 29, 2017, and\\\\xa0Ech-Chahedy's back was to the main door of the mosque.  He heard a burst of sound, and, moments later, caught a glimpse of a man with dark hair walking through the entryway. The man was carrying a gun.  \\\"My son pulled me,\\\" Ech-Chahedy\\\\xa0told Al Jazeera earlier this month in a telephone interview from Quebec City.  \\\"He said, 'Dad, he wants to kill you,'\\\" Ech-Chahedy recalled.\\\\xa0  \\\"I turned towards the children ... and I told them, 'We need to run.'

When the gunman finished shooting, six Muslim worshippers were dead, more than a dozen people were injured and Ech-Chahedy and other members of the Muslim community in Quebec City were in shock.   'More mistrust'  In the aftermath of the deadly attack, Quebec and Canadian politicians, community groups and faith leaders condemned the violence, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling it a \\\"terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge\\\".

That is twice the number of anti-Muslim incidents that were reported a year earlier, Pigeon said.   {articleGUID}   For Mohamed Labidi, president of the mosque, it is clear that \\\"there is a problem in the city of Quebec\\\".  Over the last year, the mosque has received new threats, [far-right groups](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/explained-increased-legitimacy- quebec-171113165016639.html) have mobilised with greater visibility, and plans to build a Muslim cemetery incited a hateful response from some residents in the region, he explained.

Last year, a [symbolic parliamentary motion](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/canada-passes-103-motion- islamophobia-170324074557381.html) condemning Islamophobia drew ire from right-wing politicians and groups, several of which staged anti-Muslim protests in cities across Canada under the guise of freedom of speech.  Forty-six percent of Canadians also said they viewed the presence of Islam in public life negatively, an Angus Reid [poll](http://angusreid.org/faith- public-square/) reported in November.  Leila Nasr, a spokesperson for the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), an advocacy group, said for many people across Canada - Muslim and non-Muslim alike - \\\"the grieving really hasn't finished\\\" over the attack.   ![](/mritems/Images/2017/4/28/55f2ed856c76410a8f24564c64496e8e_18.jpg)  ---  Vigils were held across Canada in the aftermath of the deadly attack [Christinne Muschi/Reuters]     She told Al Jazeera that Canadians are increasingly aware, however, that Islamophobia is a problem that \\\"has to be confronted.  \\\"It's not just a problem for Canadian Muslims or those perceived to be Muslims; it's a problem for all Canadians,\\\" she said.  Dozens of groups, including NCCM, launched a renewed [call](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/quebec-parties-oppose-marking- day-islamophobia-180109071230493.html) this month to have the federal government recognise January 29 as a Canada-wide day of action to combat Islamophobia. So far, Ottawa has only said it \\\"received and noted\\\" the request.  \\\"It's incredibly important for our elected officials to send a strong message at times like this. It's important that they speak out very clearly and unequivocally against Islamophobia,\\\" Nasr said.   Nationwide vigils  Several days of commemorations have been organised to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack. A vigil will be held in Quebec City on Monday evening, while other events are being organised across Canada.  A spokesperson for Islamic Relief Canada, a nationwide Muslim charity, said it was important to mark the anniversary by supporting the families of the six men who were killed.  \\\"A source of inspiration is the strength of the survivors, the six women and 17 children who lost husbands and fathers in the space of a few terrifying seconds a year ago,\\\" spokesperson Reyhana Patel said in a statement.  \\\"The slow recovery of their lives and sense of security - alongside their emphatic rejection of any further hatred and division - is, quite simply, the most compelling response to the tragic shooting of last year,\\\" she said.  Labidi said that Muslim organisations have worked hard to highlight the dangers Islamophobia can pose since the attack, and the renewed vigour with which individuals are fighting all forms of bigotry should be seen as the silver lining to the tragedy.  \\\"Sometimes we're hit by the types of tragedies that we lived through in Quebec City ... and we can draw lessons from it and move forward to improve the situation Muslims are living in, both in Quebec and Canada,\\\" he said.  \\\"Sometimes positive things can come out of pain.\\\"   ![](/mritems/Images/2017/12/20/2003d6a31af14cc9a991bc17a21274ad_18.jpg)  ---  Public funerals for the victims were held in Montreal and Quebec City last year [Chris Wattie/Reuters]     For his part, Ech-Chahedy, who works as a physical education teacher and taekwondo instructor, urged people not to paint all Quebecers with a single brush because of the attack.  \\\"They shouldn't condemn all Quebecers as racists or xenophobes ...

It has been especially hard on his young son, who witnessed the violence.  \\\"Even until today, he sometimes has nightmares and doesn't sleep through the night,\\\" he said.  \\\"For a child, it's very difficult.

Last month, the [US sparked outrage](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12 /key-developments-trump-jerusalem-move-171214135132799.html) among Palestinians and others over its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

According to Ramallah-based development consultant, Sam Bahour, Trump's threat is not without precedent.  \\\"This is not the first time cutting or threatening to cut funds were used for political coercion,\\\" Bahour told Al Jazeera.  \\\"The most glaring example of this was when the US supported elections in 2006 and could not swallow the [idea of]\\\\xa0[Hamas winning](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/hamas-fatah-goal- approaches-171012064342008.html), and the result was cutting funds to the Palestinian Authority.\\\"   Nature of aid  The US is one of the largest foreign contributors to the PA's Ministry of Finance, providing it with $477m in the period between January 2012 and May 2016, according to a [study](http://www.aidwatch.ps/) by Aid Watch Palestine.  US aid comes in the form of money to help run PA security forces, as well as to help the social welfare of Palestinians through organisations such as the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine ([UNRWA](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/unrwa.html)).  \\\"If the US withdrew its funding, then the PA could face a transformational financial crisis, depending on what form those cuts take,\\\" said Jeremy Wildeman, a University of Bath academic and one of the authors of the Aid Watch report.  But due to the irregular timing of payments by the US, the PA was \\\"sustained\\\" by other international donors and not fully reliant on Washington, Wildeman told Al Jazeera.\\\\xa0       ---   **WATCH:** [Al Jazeera's Year review 2017 (4:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQIuGMewD0)      \\\"The\\\\xa0PA could potentially weather US cuts if those are just to direct budgetary support for the PA.\\\"  Where things would get difficult for the Palestinians, he argued, would be if the US also stopped funding social welfare projects in the occupied territories.\\\\xa0  \\\"The US is a very significant donor to Palestinian social welfare through multilateral funds, in particular, UNRWA, where it is far-and-away the biggest donor, accounting for nearly a quarter of UNRWA's budget with about $370m in 2016,\\\" Wildeman said.  UNRWA plays a significant role in supporting Palestinian refugees with access to education, healthcare, social services, and employment.  \\\"If the US withdrew its funding from UNRWA, that would put enormous strain on the PA to cover those services for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians ... that it currently doesn't have to provision, and it would not be able to afford.\\\"  Wildeman, like others whom Al Jazeera contacted, argued that as long as welfare services, such as those provided by UNRWA, were left untouched, US cuts could be self-defeating and may even bring about benefit to the lives of ordinary Palestinians.  The US devotes significant, though undisclosed, sums of money to the PA security apparatus that many see as benefiting the Israeli occupation instead of the Palestinian people.\\\\xa0  \\\"A cut [to security forces] would likely be good, since that is not a priority for the Palestinians when their primary needs are liberation, equality and social welfare,\\\" he said, adding \\\"there is an enormous debate as to whom they serve and for what purpose.\\\"   'Inherently problematic'  Wildeman stressed that US aid to the PA was not born of altruistic feeling and that the funds bought Washington a level of regional stability and a \\\"client sympathetic to US interests among the Palestinian population\\\". Cutting aid, he explained, could cost the US both.  \\\"Without funding, that client is unlikely to follow US dictates and the idea that the US is the arbiter of the Peace Process.  \\\"Further, without those funds, the PA loses the ability to fund that security apparatus and buy the loyalty of its own population.\\\"  Alaa Tartir, programme director of Al Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, told Al Jazeera that US money is \\\"fundamentally and inherently problematic\\\" for Palestinians and that aid had served as the \\\"complementary arm of the Israeli colonial occupation.  \\\"US aid has been always used as a political tool, and the conditionality attached to it has always been harmful and damaging for the Palestinians,\\\" he said.\\\\xa0  \\\"The [...] cut will have some negative consequences on the lives of the Palestinians, yet the long-term prospect is more positive.\\\"\\\\xa0  > Trump's threat to cut aid offers the ordinary Palestinians a new opportunity to place the principles of self-determination and dignity in the core of the aid framework and industry.\\\\r > > Alaa Tartir,\\\\xa0Al Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network > >   According to Tartir, who co-authored the Aid Watch Palestine report with Wildeman, resolving the political roots of Palestinian grievances trumps any benefits received from monetary aid.

Much of the criticism stems from their involvement in security coordination with Israel, which portrays them as native enforcers of the occupation,\\\" she said from the [occupied West Bank](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/occupied-west-bank.html) city of Ramallah.   Oslo and the entrenching of occupation  After officially recognising Israel's existence in 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organisation ([PLO](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/plo.html)) and Israel signed the Oslo Accords in 1993 and 1995, which meant to lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state through the establishment of an interim Palestinian government - the Palestinian Authority.  The Oslo deals also gifted [Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Israel.html) complete control of the Palestinian economy, civil and security matters in more than 60 percent of the West Bank, and introduced the controversial [security coordination](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/palestinians- denounce-pa-israel-security-coordination-170313103710942.html) between Israel and the PA.  Since then, the PA has done little to improve the economic situation for Palestinians, many of whom have resorted to working in Israel as low-skilled workers.  Analysts Al Jazeera spoke to suggested that Oslo has been effectively dead as far back as the start of the second Intifada, nearly two decades ago.  As such, the PA has always been under scrutiny for the lack of economic prosperity, and, in particular, for its security coordination with Israel that has repeatedly silenced dissent 3 whether it was against the occupation or the PA and its policies.  The accords were meant to kick-start peace talks brokered by the [US](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html), with a two- state solution as the desired objective of negotiations.  But efforts to strike a deal over the years have been fruitless, leaving the Palestinians with the provisional self-governing authority that has been unable to prevent Israeli occupation from expanding.  From Israel's illegal [settlement](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/50-years-illegal- settlements/index.html) expansion project to home demolition orders and forced arrests, Palestinians in the occupied territories lack adequate leadership that could act as a viable alternative to the PA.       ---   **WATCH:** [Palestinians boycott Mike Pence's visit to Israel (2:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8KnsgK5NhE)      Hawari noted that [Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald- trump.html)'s announcement provided a much-needed opportunity for the PA to gain back some legitimacy and \\\"sense of dignity as the representative of the Palestinian people\\\", but has instead reaffirmed that it will continue with the peace process without US mediation.  \\\"The disappointment and disbelief in the PA's reaction to Trump are tangible on the ground here in Palestine,\\\" she explained.  The PA claims to have legitimacy through its position as a partner in the Palestinian negotiations, but Hawari says the authority uses this rhetoric to justify their leadership position.   The PA and Israel's 'tacit support'  The recent move by the US to cut $65m - more than half of its planned funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/unrwa.html)) - has incensed many Palestinians.  For nearly 70 years, UNRWA has been the lifeline to the more than five million registered Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and [Lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/lebanon.html), Jordan and Syria, offering support in food supply, education, healthcare, social services and employment.  Apart from UNRWA aid, the US is also one of the largest foreign contributors to the PA's Ministry of Finance, providing it with $477m in the period between January 2012 and May 2016, according to a study by Aid Watch Palestine.  Jeremy Wildeman, an academic at the University of Bath and one of the authors of the Aid Watch report, said the PA is dependent on both international donors and Israel for funding to exist, \\\"from the donors in the form of aid, and Israel from returned tax revenues.  \\\"It [PA] is an undemocratic government selected, backed and kept in power by Western donors who have been intimately involved in constructing it under occupation,\\\" Wilderman told Al Jazeera.  \\\"The PA \\\\u2026 relies on the government of Israel's tacit support to operate and to retain 'freedoms' they have gotten used to under that rule,\\\" he added.   'New lease of life'  Some believe that the PA, in light of the latest US move, may have been given a \\\"new lease of life\\\".  Salim Tamari, director of the Institute of Palestine Studies, believes that the PA was able to mobilise people in favour of defiance on the question of Jerusalem.       ---   **WATCH:** [US withholds another $45m for Palestinian food aid (2:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX8wIVCMUfw)      \\\"In terms of long-term options, the ability of the PA to survive depends very much on the negotiations with Hamas in Gaza and the ability to form a national unity government,\\\" Tamari explained, referring to a reconciliation deal made in October that seeks to form a unity government between Fatah and [Hamas](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/hamas.html) 3 the movement governing the Gaza Strip.  \\\"And, in addition, the ability to mobilise resources to survive as an authority,\\\" he added.  Simultaneously, a considerable chunk of the population depends on the public sector and the PA's salaries.  \\\"They [people] rely on the PA's continued relationship with Israel and the survival of the bureaucracy of the PA 3 regardless of the type of ideology it has,\\\" Tamari said.  He also pointed out that many Palestinians fear the rise of what he described as \\\"warlords\\\", referencing Mohammed Dahlan - the 55-year-old, exiled, former [Fatah](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/Fatah.html) official - as an alternative to the PA.  According to Tamari, the question of a two-state solution is not dominating the \\\"daily discussion\\\" in [Palestine](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/palestine.html). Rather, people question how they can resist the continued occupation, which is not being articulated as a political vision.  This is the case for several reasons. Tamari noted that \\\"opposition\\\" is expressed by intellectuals, opposition press, and non-governmental organisations among Palestinians, and not by a grassroots movement 3 while other, existing parties continue to maintain relationships with the PA to guarantee \\\"pieces of the pie\\\".  But even if the existing opposition manages to unify into a \\\"legitimate polity and representative institutions\\\", dissolving the PA will not be an easy, straightforward, or quick process, according to Alaa Tartir, director of Al Shabaka.  \\\"Over the last quarter of a century, complex structures, dynamics, and institutions emerged and solidified in the West Bank and Gaza, and dismantling this complexity will not occur by speeches, announcements, or declarations,\\\" Tartir explained.  \\\"A phasing-out process requires serious actions, concrete and clear steps, and a national action and rescue plan for a transition towards a post two-states formula and a post-Oslo Accords framework,\\\" he added. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"What is in store for the Palestinian Authority?\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/store-palestinian-authority-180125115938726.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ [Donald Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html) gave his first interview to a UK journalist on Sunday, while he was attending the World Economic Forum in [Davos](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/trump- davos-america-swiss-protests-180126133915457.html), Switzerland.

With 2017 being confirmed as the second or third warmest year since 1880 by all the major meteorological agencies, and the warmest non-El Nino year on record, it is hardly surprising that sea and land ice, too, is under threat.  Sea ice in the Arctic is monitored by NOAA.  Its annual [Arctic Report Card](http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card), issued in December, revealed that the region is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. The year saw a new record low for the maximum sea ice extent.  That is \\\"the largest magnitude decline in sea ice, and the greatest sustained rate in sea ice decline in that 1,500-year record\\\", according to Emily Osborne, the scientist who compiled the data for the chart.  Much of the ice is now thin and young, with thicker, older ice comprising 21 percent of the total coverage, compared with 45 percent in 1985.  The pattern in the [Antarctic](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/earthrise/2017/06/antarctica- edge-170626084330247.html) remains more complicated with some areas seeing ice shrinkage, while others are expanding.  Trump's dismissal of climate change science has seen some US scientists relocating to France, aiming to seek a more conducive working atmosphere.  It seems they may have to start learning the language, as the US president shows no sign of changing his views any time soon. ] \", \n         \"source\": \"Al Jazeera English\", \n         \"title\": \"Once again, Trump skips facts on climate change\", \n         \"url\": \"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/trump-skips-facts-climate-change-180130091555763.html\"\n      }, \n      {\n         \"article\": \"[ [Saudi Arabia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html) has established specialised anti-corruption units of prosecutors tasked with investigating corruption cases in the kingdom, state media reported.
