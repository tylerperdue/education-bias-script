 President Trump and his aides have spent much of the past month heralding the historically low unemployment rate for black Americans.  cSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages, the president said during his State of the Union address Tuesday.  cUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Trump\xa0has been criticized recently for taking more credit for the low unemployment rate than he should. The black unemployment rate has been decreasing for eight years, and it recorded its most significant drops during the presidency of Trump 9s predecessor, Barack Obama, The Washington Post 9s Philip Bump\xa0has\xa0reported(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/01/16 /no-trumps-approval-among-black-americans-hasnt- doubled/?utm_term=.ffe80fc9b99f). But\xa0often\xa0overlooked\xa0in Trump 9s praise of himself is that the black unemployment rate is _nearly double_ the white unemployment rate.\xa0While the black unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in December 2017, the\xa0white unemployment rate(https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000003)\xa0was 3.7 percent. A tweet by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on the first day of Black History Month highlighted the issue of discrimination in the workplace.\xa0But in reality, the issues of the two men\xa0in her tribute are still very real today.

Less than two weeks later, about 1,300 black men employed by the Memphis Department of Public Works went on strike demanding better safety standards. But another\xa0issue that motivated the men 9s strike was the demand\xa0for ca decent wage. The sanitation workers were mostly black and did not receive compensation and benefits comparable to other city employees, many of whom were white. The protests eventually prompted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to go to Memphis to draw attention to the protest. His involvement was notable for highlighting demands to decrease the black-white wage gap as part of his\xa0fight for equal rights for black Americans. A few days later, he was assassinated. Racist policies that existed in the 1960s 4 and centuries before 4 still factor into the wealth gap between black and white Americans in 2018.

Wealth translates into opportunity. Some of Trump 9s lowest approval ratings come from black Americans. Much of that disdain stems from comments that black Americans and lawmakers who represent them consider racist, but it is also because many Americans believe the Trump administration treats African Americans differently. A recent\xa0poll(https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/01/21 /National- Politics/Polling/question_19722.xml?uuid=3hN1Uv5oEeebXbvw2jEhTQ)\xa0by The Post and ABC News showed that 40 percent of Americans strongly believe Trump has a bias against black people. One way Trump could lower that number, besides refraining from making racially insensitive comments, is by explaining what he plans to do to eliminate the unemployment gap between black and white Americans.
