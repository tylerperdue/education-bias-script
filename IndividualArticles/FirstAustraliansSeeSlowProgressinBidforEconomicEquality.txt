  Indigenous Australians, the nation 9s poorest and most disadvantaged group, have made ground in health and childhood education but still lag their countrymen in most key measures. Four of seven targets to improve disadvantage aren 9t being met, which is still the best result since 2011, the government 9s annual Closing the Gap report(https://closingthegap.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/ctg- report-2018.pdf?a=1 "Link to Report") on Monday showed. In a bid to help erase economic disparity, indigenous businesses had received more than A$1 billion ($780 million) in government-commissioned contracts since 2015, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.  cWe cannot close the gap if we do not have equal participation in the economy, Turnbull told parliament.     The report shows where Australia stands in its bid to end differences in health care, education, and job opportunities between the nation 9s 650,000 Aborigines and other Australians, about 230 years after European settlement. Indigenous Australians populated the continent at least 50,000 years ago and make up about 3 percent of the population. The program, initiated by then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2008, has sometimes struggled for momentum due to changes in government leadership. Over the eight years to 2016, about A$23.8 billion was spent through the program to improve conditions for the indigenous, the Australian newspaper reported on Monday.
