  Economists descended on Philadelphia last weekend\xa0for an annual conference that 9s basically wonk utopia.   Central bankers, Nobel laureates and the profession 9s elite professors debated the merits of math-heavy models\xa0in packed conference rooms while\xa0Ph.D. job market candidates vied\xa0for jobs down the hall.\xa0The American Economic\xa0Association\xa0confab 9s\xa0program spanned three days and hundreds of topics, with major themes ranging from the death of the Phillips(/news/terminal/%7BNSN%20P278Y96KLVR4%20%3CGO%3E%7D)\xa0Curve to how women are treated(/news/terminal/%7BNSN%20P27CQ06VDKHS%20%3CGO%3E%7D) in the field.\xa0And amid all that hustle and bustle, even the most dedicated econ- nerd might have missed a paper or two.   Fortunately, we 9ve got your back. Here are five of our favorite,\xa0from a look at wages and the opioid\xa0crisis to an analysis of how the Fed responds to stock market changes. This is a special edition\xa0of our weekly Eco Pulse column, which you can check each Tuesday for new and pertinent economic research from around the world.  Drugs and money\xa0  _Wage and Employment Growth in America 9s Drug Epidemic: Is All Growth Created Equal?\xa0  Published\xa0December\xa02017\xa0  Available (https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/paper/Syhtt452 "AEA Website")at\xa0the AEA website_   It turns out wage\xa0stagnation may be playing into the opioid crisis. As a recap, previous research has made is clear that unemployment(http://www.nber.org/papers/w23192 "Hollingsworth") and trade shocks(http://www.nber.org/papers/w22849 "Pierce paper") are associated with an increase in\xa0overdose deaths. This new paper, from Ohio State 9s Michael\xa0Betz and Lauren Jones, finds\xa0that in rural areas, 5 percent faster wage growth at the lowest-paying\xa0tier of the industry distribution could cut the drug overdose death rate by 10\xa0percent.\xa0\xa0In metro areas, faster wage gains in middle- and bottom-tier industries would come with fewer overdose deaths. cIn rural areas, local economic conditions are not affecting overdose rates primarily through work availability, but rather through wage growth, the authors write. cThis finding is a new piece of the story and suggests that the unemployment rate may not fully capture the macroeconomic conditions that are important predictors of overdose. d\xa0   Perhaps most unexpectedly, stronger employment growth in top-tier industries\xa0causes more overdose deaths in metro counties and among men in rural areas, according to the authors. Why? It could be that inequality of opportunity is weighing on people, or that working increases access to employer-provided health insurance, increasing prescription opioid supply.\xa0  When prices are personalized  _Dynamic Competition in the Era of Big Data  Published December 2017  Available(https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary?q=eNqrVipOTSxKzlCyqgayiosz8_NCKgtSkbhKVkqGSrU6SonFxfnJQI6SjlJJalEukJWUma6QkliSCBRJSayESmXmpkJYZZmp5SBjigoKgAKmBkq1tbVcMMKDXCIw "AEA website")\xa0at the AEA website_     What if product\xa0price-tags were\xa0based on your needs and characteristics? It 9s happening, and this paper argues that it 9s economically important. Using eBay data, the authors look at the gains from sophisticated forms of price discrimination on phones and tablets. cOn\xa0average, most consumers benefit from the introduction of price discrimination and that consumer surplus gains more than offset the loss in profits suffered by firms, d\xa0Patrick Kehoe, Brad Larsen, and Elena Pastorino write. But it hurts to be picky. cConsumers more certain about their tastes are, however, worse off under price discrimination.  So, about the Amazon effect\xa0  _Internet Rising, Prices Falling  Powerpoint dated January 2018  Available(https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/1598?q=eNqrVipOLS7OzM8LqSxIVbKqhnGVrJQMlWp1lBKLi_OTgRwlHaWS1KJcXCArKTNdISWxJBEokpJYCZXKzE2FsMoyU8tBxhQVFFwwBUwNlGprATgwHkQ, "AEA website")\xa0at the AEA website_ Using data collected through Adobe Analytics, which tracks online prices and quantities,\xa0University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee and Stanford 9s Pete Klenow\xa0find that online inflation averaged about 100 basis points\xa0lower than inflation in the CPI for the same categories between 2014 and 2017. What 9s more, there was a huge variety of products sold online 3\xa0goods\xa0were introduced and removed rapidly 3\xa0and factoring that in implies shaving off another 90 to 150 basis points from online inflation versus the matched CPI indices. This research is in its early stages,\xa0but it could be\xa0 a big deal, because it quantifies\xa0that internet commerce could be weighing on goods prices and making them harder to measure.\xa0  Stocks and the Fed  _The Economics of the Fed Put  Published\xa0April 2017  Available(https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/1598?q=eNqrVipOLS7OzM8LqSxIVbKqhnGVrJQMlWp1lBKLi_OTgRwlHaWS1KJcXCArKTNdISWxJBEokpJYCZXKzE2FsMoyU8tBxhQVFFwwBUwNlGprATgwHkQ, "AEA website")\xa0at the AEA website_   The next time you 9re trying to figure out whether the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, maybe skip the data and watch the markets instead. Stock returns are a statistically more powerful predictor of the Fed lowering rates\xa0than standard macroeconomic releases, Duke University 9s Anna Cieslak and University of California at Berkeley 9s Annette Vissing- Jorgensen find.\xa0 cConsistent with the Fed put, the number of negative stock market mentions 4but not the number of positive stock market mentions 4has significant explanatory power for target changes over the 1994 32008 period, they write.\xa0   Textual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee minutes and transcripts suggests that they might actually _cause_ the changes: it 9s not just that prices reflect\xa0a mosaic of information that the Fed has also built into its reaction function. Fed deliberations either look at\xa0how stock wealth changes\xa0will affect consumption 4economic variables like cconsumer spending d\xa0are most frequently discussed in paragraphs mentioning the stock market\xa0 3\xa0or focus on\xa0the market 9s impact on investment. They more rarely address stocks as a metric that simply reflects economic activity.\xa0\xa0 \xa0  Weekly demo(graphic)\xa0 !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIdXMkP706Gs/v0/60x-1.png) Good news for American girls: they 9ve nearly reached chore parity with teenage boys. This is potentially economically important. cThese notable changes in the housework roles seem likely to persist into young adulthood and to continue the long term change to a more similar division of labor of men and women, authors Ping Li, from the\xa0South China Normal University and Frank Stafford, from the\xa0University of Michigan, write in their paper.\xa0Women currently spend more time on non-market work than men even when they have jobs, so that could free up extra time to dedicate to their careers\xa0 3\xa0or to Netflix.\xa0
