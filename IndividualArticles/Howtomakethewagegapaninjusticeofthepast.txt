 The pay gap matters to everyone -- and should be a top priority in every community across the country. I say it's time we work together to end it. !Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170409101815-equal-pay-women- large-169.jpg)(/2017/04/11/opinions/equal-pay-talk-should-be-for-all-women- jones-opinion/index.html) Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn(/2017/04/11/opinions/equal- pay-talk-should-be-for-all-women-jones-opinion/index.html) At the American Association of University Women (AAUW), our 170,000 members(https://www.aauw.org/) and supporters throughout the 50 states and US territories have a goal: Close the pay gap now. And we have a plan(https://www.aauw.org/fairpay/). No single act will do it -- we need to bring the pieces together for change. First, we need strong federal and state pay equity laws. It's been more than 50 years since the Equal Pay Act of 1963(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm), prohibiting workplace wage discrimination on the basis of sex and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act(https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm), barring all employment discrimination on the basis of race, religion and national origin, as well as sex. While these laws helped to make advances, they are in need of 21st century updates. In short, times have changed, and laws must too. And many states are now taking action. In 2017, 42 states(https://www.aauw.org/2017/10/13/state- equal-pay-victories-in-2017/) introduced laws to address the wage gap. Their strategies ranged from banning salary histories to ensuring employees have vital access to salary information in order to identify if they are being paid unfairly. Five states and Puerto Rico succeeded in passing their laws. This year, per AAUW's internal monitoring, 38 states have pay equity legislation under consideration, with a new law passing in Washington state just last month. !Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404161412-starbucks-maternity- leave-2-large-169.jpg)(/2017/04/04/opinions/paid-family-leave-for-all- boushey-bethell/index.html) Everyone should have a shot at paid family leave(/2017/04/04/opinions/paid- family-leave-for-all-boushey-bethell/index.html) Second, we must change employer practices and break down barriers for women. Growing numbers of employers recognize fair pay and good benefits are not just good for employees, they are good for business and bottom lines.

Third, we must support women in advocating for themselves. At AAUW, we are launching a new commitment to train 10 million women to negotiate their financial futures by 2022. Through AAUW's Work Smart program(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http- 3A__bit.ly_NegotiateNow&d=DwMFAg&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=rz4oN5WSLeQq9veWzO9LvZAr9bK4sqmmNDo8Im869pQ&m=lzq8NpCMw1nOFMa4S9ogjy6OBzNAZKtQyl408muoK8o&s=q-fIRYr4yaxhEdC9yX6Jb3SR9xJZkGEEb5CjKF8niQM&e=), we will give women the skills they need to effectively understand their market worth -- based on experience and accomplishments -- and the tools and confidence to negotiate for it. In workshops around the country, we have seen that when women negotiate for higher pay, it can result in more income for themselves and their families. While you can't negotiate around discrimination, this effort will help accelerate change for women and the broader movement for equal pay.

Beginning with Mayor Marty Walsh in Boston, all are partnering with AAUW to provide salary negotiation workshops that are helping women at every level of their career. Take Maryanne(https://www.tbf.org/-/media/tbforg/files/reports /gaining-ground-on-equal-pay.pdf?la=en), a 40-year-old mother of two and nonprofit media company employee who negotiated for a $22,000 raise once she became aware she was paid less than her less-experienced male counterparts for equal work. City by city and state by state, together we can change the paradigm by passing strong pay equity laws and engaging employers and individual employees in the fight for equal pay(https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http- 3A__bit.ly_FightforFairPay&d=DwMFAg&c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&r=rz4oN5WSLeQq9veWzO9LvZAr9bK4sqmmNDo8Im869pQ&m=lzq8NpCMw1nOFMa4S9ogjy6OBzNAZKtQyl408muoK8o&s=0lT7vx68e71lIv4rQpx6Ehc4ZlRexlcXxcK99LH90K0&e=).
