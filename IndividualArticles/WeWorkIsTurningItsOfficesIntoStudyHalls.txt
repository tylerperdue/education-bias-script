  WeWork\xa0Cos.(/quote/0134620D:US)\xa0wants to be more than an office landlord.\xa0The co-working giant 9s latest venture will give online- degree seekers a desk at WeWork locations. The New York company told Bloomberg it 9s\xa0teaming up with online education provider\xa02U Inc., which develops graduate courses for schools, including\xa0New York University,\xa0University of California, Berkeley, and Yale University. Students enrolled in digital courses offered by 2U\xa0will be able to\xa0study from WeWork offices, where they can join in-person study groups and rent conference rooms to work together\xa0with classmates. Students will have access to any of WeWork 9s 207 locations, known for their hip decor, free Wi-Fi and on-tap kombucha. Education has been a recent focus of WeWork and its founding couple, Adam and Rebekah Neumann. Last year, WeWork\xa0began testing\xa0 a\xa0private elementary school\xa0in one of its New York locations\xa0and\xa0acquired Flatiron School, a coding academy.     2U agreed to pay $15 million to incorporate Flatiron School software into its online degree programs,\xa0said Gwendolyn Rocco, a spokeswoman for WeWork. 2U also committed to give $5 million in scholarships to\xa0WeWork members. Next year, the two companies plan to\xa0build a learning center, where 2U faculty can host master classes, lecture series and events in a WeWork-designed space. 2U 9s shares rose 3.3 percent to $74.8\xa0in premarket\xa0trading Monday in New York. WeWork\xa0is eager to expand beyond month-to-month desk rentals. In addition to schools, the company is adding\xa0apartments, event spaces and\xa0wellness centers\xa0to its office buildings.\xa0WeWork, which is backed by more than $5\xa0billion\xa0in funding, has been acquiring businesses and partners to bring other activities to\xa0locations around the world.\xa0Last year,\xa0WeWork\xa0said it had purchased\xa0Meetup, a social network for events. By providing 2U students with space\xa0for their schoolwork\xa0and study groups,\xa0WeWork\xa0aims to attract new customers who may prefer the hip environment of a co-working space to a\xa0library. Another perk that might catch students 9\xa0attention: Most\xa0WeWork\xa0locations offer craft beer on tap.
