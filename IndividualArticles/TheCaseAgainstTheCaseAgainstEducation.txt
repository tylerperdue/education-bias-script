  Libertarian economist Bryan Caplan didn 9t strive for subtlety when he titled his new book _The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_. As I wrote in a  Remarks column(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/the-case-against- college) in the print edition of _Bloomberg Businessweek_ , the George Mason University professor makes a strong case that most of what people learn in high school and college is unnecessary and quickly forgotten. He says that only about a fifth of the value of an education is the increase in human capital. The rest is csignaling 4the degree itself puts you in line ahead of non-graduates, even if you learned nothing useful, because it tells potential employers that you 9re reasonably smart, reasonably determined to complete what you started, and reasonably good at fitting in. Signaling is a zero-sum game: possibly useful for the individual who gets ahead, but wasteful for society. I recommend the book. Still,\xa0I can 9t fully buy\xa0Caplan 9s conclusion that the solution is to cut back drastically on taxpayer support for college, and even high school. Caplan\xa0disagrees with my disagreement. On the\xa0blog he shares with some other economists, EconLog, he called(http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2018/01/two_comments_on.html) my article cfun and fair but indicated that I had fallen victim to csocial desirability bias by arguing that society should bend over backward not to deprive lower-income strivers of the human capital that college does build. (He also made a fair point\xa0about my throwaway line concerning Sanskrit and cement mixing, and I agree with him, so set that aside.) Here 9s Caplan: > Human beings like saying 4\xa0and believing 4\xa0whatever sounds good, even if what sounds good makes little sense.\xa0My question for Coy: If deleting 80% of the perceived social rewards of education makes you no more willing to cut public support for public education, what would?\xa0 What if we deleted 90% of education&apos;s perceived social rewards?\xa095%\xa099%?\xa0I know it sounds nice to say, "If it helps one person, it&apos;s worth it," but that&apos;s crazy.\xa0No one spends their own money so casually 4\xa0nor should they.\xa0Furthermore, you can easily use some of the budgetary savings to help "strivers" in more cost-effective ways.\xa0So why not?     So let me answer that question. I accept Caplan 9s economics-y point that life involves trade-offs. If public support for education helped just one person while costing $1 trillion, it wouldn 9t be worth it. Likewise, if Caplan could prove that wasteful signaling accounts for 99\xa0percent of the value of\xa0education. But that 9s not what he says. He says it accounts for 80 percent of the value of education. Some other economists put the ratio considerably lower 4less than half. And reforms could further increase the amount of human capital that the education system creates. In other words, education really does educate, even if it is overly expensive and not very effective. When you yank public funding from education, you are making it difficult or impossible for children who grew up poor or in the lower middle class to get the same access to learning that children of rich families take for granted. As for Caplan 9s idea of using some of the savings to help strivers in more cost-effective ways: Tracking low-income students toward vocational education because it 9s all they can afford feels Dickensian(http://dickens.port.ac.uk/poverty/). Libertarians such as\xa0Caplan\xa0stress individual liberty and minimal taxation. Most of us are a bit more communitarian, meaning that we 9re more likely to think of society as a family. A family tries to give every child the very best shot at success, even when it is (overly) expensive to do so. If that 9s what Caplan\xa0wants to call csocial desirability bias, so be it.
