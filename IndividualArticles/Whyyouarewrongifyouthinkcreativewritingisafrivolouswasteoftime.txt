Under his tutelage, students completed a small book of their writings. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) If you think creative writing is a cfrivolous waste of time, you are just plain wrong. So writes English teacher Justin Parmenter, who laments that writing has become clittle more than an afterthought d(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.d0ecfaa28732) in this era when standardized testing reigns supreme, with serious consequences for students. Parmenter, an educator for more than 20 years, teaches seventh-grade language arts at Waddell Language Academy in Charlotte and is a fellow with Hope Street Group 9s North Carolina Teacher Voice Network, which provides feedback to education policymakers. His first teaching job was at a school on the White Mountain Apache Reservation in the poorest county in Arizona, where young people face extraordinary challenges. He started his career as a Peace Corps volunteer in Albania and taught in Istanbul. He was a finalist for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Teacher of the Year in 2016, and you can find him on Twitter here: @JustinParmenter(https://twitter.com/justinparmenter) This first appeared in Teachers & Writers Magazine(https://teachersandwritersmagazine.org/a-defense-of-creative- writing-in-the-age-of-standardized-testing-4460.htm), which gave me permission to publish it here. _ The real reasons so many young people can 9t write well today 4 by an English teacher (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.2c2ec99f20ba)_ **By Justin Parmenter** Ask any English teacher what he or she could use more of, and chances are you 9ll get the same answer.\xa0 Classroom resources are great, more money would be nice, but what we _really_ need is more time. Just like in any other discipline, English teachers have way more curriculum than we can cover in a year.\xa0 Time constraints force educators to prioritize by order of what feels most important, and all too often that importance is determined by what 9s going to be on the test. Our students pay the price as activities that cultivate essential real-world skills such as collaboration and creativity and provide them with a much more engaging and well-rounded education are eliminated from their classes. Educators are under enormous pressures stemming from a data-driven culture most recently rooted in No Child Left Behind and its successor, the Every Student Succeeds Act, in which the ultimate measure of professional and academic success is a standardized test score. As a result of this standardized testing culture, many of our English students spend way too much time reading random passages which are completely detached from their lives and answering multiple choice questions in an attempt to improve test results.\xa0 In many classrooms, writing has become little more than an afterthought(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer- sheet/wp/2017/11/08/the-real-reasons-so-many-young-people-cant-write-well- today-by-an-english-teacher/?utm_term=.d0ecfaa28732). Creative writing, in particular, is seen by some as a frivolous waste of time because its value is so difficult to justify with data. _ Teacher: What happened when I stopped viewing my students as data points (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/10/11/teacher-what- happened-when-i-stopped-viewing-my-students-as-data- points/?utm_term=.e96d3c779c3f)_ Two decades before the advent of No Child Left Behind, the research of influential literacy professor Gail Tompkins identified seven compelling reasons(https://www.ericdigests.org/1996-3/writing.htm) why children should spend time writing creatively in class: _\xa0_  * to entertain  * to foster artistic expression  * to explore the functions and values of writing  * to stimulate imagination  * to clarify thinking  * to search for identity  * to learn to read and write The majority of Tompkins 9s outcomes of creative writing could never be measured on today 9s standardized tests.\xa0 Indeed, over the same period that standardized reading tests have pushed writing in English classes to the sidelines, efforts to evaluate student writing on a broad, systematic scale have dwindled.\xa0 Measuring student writing is expensive, and accurately assessing abstract thinking requires human resources most states aren 9t willing to pony up.\xa0 It 9s much cheaper to score a bubble sheet. Measurement and assessment aside, the soft skills that we cultivate through regular creative writing with our students have tremendous real-world application as well as helping to promote the kind of atmosphere we want in our classrooms.\xa0 After many years as an English teacher, I 9ve found that carving out regular time for creative writing in class provides benefits for me and my students that we simply don 9t get from other activities. One of the benefits of creative writing in the classroom is how engaging it is for our students.\xa0 In general, much of our curriculum follows a one-size- fits-all design and allows little room for freedom of exploration. For young people who are at a time in life when many of their decisions are made for them, this lack of power can be very demotivating and can negatively impact their interest and effort.\xa0 To do their best work, students need to feel that school is about them, and they need to feel connected to the content on a personal level.\xa0\xa0 When students are given opportunities to experiment with their voices and create through their own original work, they feel a sense of place and they are able to feel in charge.\xa0 That 9s when they shine. A former student and talented writer told me the following about her relationship with creative writing in the classroom: _\xa0_ > Creative writing is important to me because it gives me a way to express myself. There are not a lot of ways, as a young teenager, to be able to freely express ideas and emotions. Many are personal feelings you wouldn 9t really want to share with others. But in writing you can put all of those mixed emotions into words. Next thing you know, you 9ve created an entirely different universe, with characters close to your heart. Everything is under your complete control. That is not something that you can experience in reality, even reading a book. The feeling that you have created something, something that you can call your own, is what makes it incredible. When we empower our students to create something that is only theirs, to make big choices in their writing, it can transform attitudes toward learning and school in general.\xa0 Having students who are motivated to work to their full potential is a dream scenario for any teacher.\xa0 Regular creative writing can help us to move in that direction. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8K3M3Vh_C9VYIHxPNgEqX578qqg=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLU33FNQF44V5K3LVOOELH333A.jpg)  Another very real benefit of creative writing in the classroom is that it can help to develop a sense of community among our students.\xa0 In our bitterly polarized society, any activity that fosters empathy and collaboration is well worth our time. Students can share writing with each other at the drafting phase, working together to hone their individual stories.\xa0 This teamwork allows our students to support each other and work to understand each other 9s perspectives.\xa0 In addition to peer editing, having students co-author creative pieces, whether as an informal cchain story type activity or a longer, more polished product, can go a long way in nurturing the skills required for effective partnership.\xa0 Sharing responsibility in the creative process serves as a powerful motivator for our students, often leading to better quality writing. !(https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tyjx1BVSC7AUFaJhbM_lDgsVNsY=/480x0 /arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod- washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GGVJHNNS4QZ2ZM7BOHLJD652LY.jpg)  It 9s unlikely that our English teachers are going to get the additional time they so desperately need.\xa0 What we 9re left with is the task of prioritizing class content in such a way that we 9re truly meeting all the needs of our students. Data is an important tool in helping us to measure how well we 9re meeting those needs, but our definition of data must be broad enough to include outcomes that can 9t be captured with a standardized test.\xa0 We must trust our English teachers to plan instruction that is in the best interests of their students and to know when they 9ve succeeded. As a regular part of that instruction, creative writing can empower our students and give them ownership so critical to their motivation.\xa0 It can provide them essential practice at partnering with their peers in a world where more effective collaboration is sorely needed. At its most powerful, creative writing can help turn our English courses into the life-changing experience that all educators want their classes to be.
