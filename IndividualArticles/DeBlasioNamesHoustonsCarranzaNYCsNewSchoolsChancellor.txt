  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio named Richard Carranza, Houston 9s superintendent of schools, to run the largest U.S. school system, days after learning that his first choice for the job had decided to remain in Miami. Carranza, 51, a second-generation Mexican-American, has run the Houston school system since August 2016. He previously had been San Francisco 9s superintendent for four years and led school systems in Tucson and Las Vegas before that.\xa0 Carranza joined de Blasio to announce the appointment at a City Hall news conference Monday. Last week, Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho reneged on an agreement to take the job.        Describing Carranza as the embodiment of the American Dream, de Blasio recounted the educator 9s upbringing as the child of immigrants who valued education.\xa0He praised Carranza 9s success in increasing test scores among black and Latino students.  cIn everything he 9s done, he 9s been devoted to children and he 9s been a change agent in his work, de Blasio said. cHe has a proven record as someone who can get results while moving an equity agenda. The Houston Independent School District(/quote/36573MF:US "Company Overview"), the largest in Texas, has a $2 billion education system serving about 214,000 students in 284 schools. New York 9s serves 1.1 million in more than 1,700 schools, with a budget of about $25 billion a year. As of last week, Houston schools were facing a budget deficit of $115 million.  cI know that across this incredible state, the city of can-doers, New York City, there are thousands and thousands of parents who have the same aspirations" as his own parents, Carranza said. cI still make it a point every week to visit classrooms. That 9s where I find my inspiration.
