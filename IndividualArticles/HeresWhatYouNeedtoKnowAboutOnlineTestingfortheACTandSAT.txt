  **Q: What kind of computers are required for an online test?** , **A:** Students can use school-owned laptops, desktops or Chromebooks. , **What are the safeguards against crashes, slow-loading tests or lost answers?** , ACT 9s test administrator, Pearson Assessment, uses proctor caching: Each testing location has its own local server, which downloads the test, delivers it to individual students and collects the answers before returning them to Pearson 9s home server. Once the tests are returned, they disappear from local computers. , The SAT 9s administrator, AIR Assessment, uses a proprietary browser with built-in redundancies, including a diagnostic tool that helps schools assess the health of their network and how many testers it can support at one time. Responses are saved on multiple servers, so if the connection is disrupted students can log on elsewhere and pick up where they left off. , **There 9s talk that the online test might one day become adaptive. What does that mean**? , Adaptive tests adjust the level of questioning according to how the test taker performs on prior questions, so that low scorers are asked fewer of the hardest questions and high scorers don 9t need to waste as much time on easy ones. That kind of test can provide a more detailed picture of what students have mastered. It also means test takers get different questions in a different order from one another and from previous exams that may have been leaked or stolen. , **Does anyone use these adaptive tests?** , The GRE and G.M.A.T. graduate exams are adaptive tests, as is the Smarter Balanced test some states use to measure Common Core skills in grades 3 to 11. Language placement exams are often adaptive, as are licensing exams for pharmacists, accountants, paramedics and other professions. ,  **READ MORE** : For the ACT and the SAT, Pencils No Longer Required, but Sometimes Necessary(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning /act-sat-college-entrance-exam.html) , **What 9s the holdup on going adaptive?** , Just to go online has required exhaustive studies and statistical analysis to ensure comparability of a paper exam score with one from a computer, time the test loading and scrolling speeds of various laptops, and assure that computerized testing doesn 9t work to the advantage of some groups of students over others. , Beyond that, adaptive testing also demands a much larger store of potential questions. , **If my school gives the** **SAT or ACT** **online, can I request a paper version instead?** , If the school opts for online testing, only students granted special accommodations for a disability can take it on paper. But schools may opt for a mixed mode of ACT testing, which would allow students to choose. , **Digital ACT and SAT tests are given on more than one day. Are they different tests, and if not, what 9s to prevent students sharing questions and answers online?** , Both companies declined to answer, citing test security, but said they take many steps to protect against cheating and ensure a fair testing environment. , **Is scratch paper allowed? Does the online test have any useful features that paper tests don 9t?** , Both tests allow pencils and scratch paper. Both tests allow you to bookmark items to return to later and have a countdown clock to keep track of time left in the section. The ACT lets you cross off answers you want to eliminate, and it marks unanswered questions with an orange dot, while the SAT provides electronic scratch paper and the ability to highlight passages. , **Where can I test** **drive an online test?** , For the ACT, visit the TestNav website, home.testnav.com(http://home.testnav.com/).
