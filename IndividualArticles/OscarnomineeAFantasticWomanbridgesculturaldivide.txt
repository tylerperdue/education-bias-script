 If some of the beats sound familiar, or even a trifle clich\xe9d, "A Fantastic Woman" avoids those pitfalls, in part because Marina is far from just a passive victim. Her actions, rather, convey not only the pain she experiences but also her strength and independence, gradually filling in the bond that she and Orlando shared while deftly drawing the audience into Marina's plight. Although there is something particular in the overt discrimination practiced toward Marina, the movie bridges language and cultural barriers, striking an emotional chord with the universal nature of its themes. It's worth noting, too, that the small, intimate approach to the story makes this a movie that will play perfectly well on TV, which is where many people will no doubt catch up with it. Granted, the "fantastic" in the title might sound like indulging a bit of hyperbole. But it comes pretty close to describing a film, and a central performance, that otherwise lose nothing in translation.  _"A Fantastic Woman" opens in New York and Los Angeles on Feb. 2 and will expand to other cities in March._
