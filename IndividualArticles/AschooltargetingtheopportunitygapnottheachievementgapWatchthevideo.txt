 This is a short video about a school that is part of a project called Schools of Opportunity, which I have written about over the past several years. So far, 45 schools have been recognized by the project 4 housed at the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder\xa0 4 for their efforts to provide opportunities for all students to learn no matter what their family circumstance. The focus is on opportunity gaps\xa0\x8d 4 not the achievement gap.

Schools that are honored are assessed on a range of factors, including how well the adults in a school building provide students with health and psychological support, as well as judicious and fair discipline policies, and broad and enriched curriculum. It is based on research that clearly shows that students learn more when they have rich opportunities and fall behind when denied those opportunities.
