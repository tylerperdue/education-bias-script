 !Why I confronted Jeff Flake on a plane(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7)!Why I confronted Jeff Flake on a plane(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171208153808-plane- argument-2-large-169.jpg)(/2017/12/15/opinions/why-i-confronted-jeff-flake- on-a-plane-barkan/index.html) Why I confronted Jeff Flake on a plane(/2017/12/15/opinions/why-i -confronted-jeff-flake-on-a-plane-barkan/index.html) These attacks, while egregious, are just the tip of the iceberg compared to a broader bipartisan assault on the rights of Americans with Disabilities Act: the ADA Education and Reform Act(https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th- congress/house-bill/620) (H.R. 620), which is expected(https://thinkprogress.org/congress-weakening-ada-2ba703798908/) to come up for a vote this week. If successful, this regressive law (https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hr-620-could-put-disability-rights-at- risk)would significantly hinder a person with a disability's right to file a lawsuit for violations of access. It would require creating a written claim with specific legal requirements to document the violation (which would be onerous for an attorney, let alone your average John Q. Public with little experience with accessibility requirements and measurements). Businesses would then have 60 days to respond and an additional 120 days make "substantial progress(https://www.defendingourfuture.org/hr-620-ada-education-and-reform- act/)" -- a term still undefined. In practice, business owners could spend decades failing to comply with the accessibility requirements of the ADA as long as they claim to be attempting substantial progress. This attempt to undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities is happening largely in response to several stories claiming that there is a growing army of disabled people cruising the streets, looking for potential lawsuits wherever they go, and are getting rich off of the spoils. The reality, of course, is that the only thing that can be collected in ADA lawsuits are attorney's fees, so no disabled person who brings charges can actually get monetary damages from a lawsuit. All they can achieve is the business remedying its inaccessibility. !A disabled, biracial, \(and totally normal\) American family (data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !A disabled, biracial, \(and totally normal\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley-family-1-large-169.jpg) !A disabled, biracial, \(and totally normal\) American family (//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171130131052-cokley- family-1-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\(0\); "Click to watch this video")  JUST WATCHED  A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH A disabled, biracial, (and totally normal) American family 04:42 Furthermore, in cases where it's assumed that there are hundreds of lawyers repeatedly filing case after case to the point of appearing fraudulent, the Center for American Progress (where I am a senior fellow) has traced the number of attorneys doing so to only 12 lawyers, and there are disciplinary actions available to take action against them in state bar associations or district courts. A federal law -- especially one that would harm more than help -- is hardly necessary here. There is a significant countermovement against this legislation, comprised of a mix of social media (with groups like Crip the Vote and others using HandsOffMyADA), traditional civil disobedience by ADAPT(http://adapt.org/) and others, visits to legislators and phone banking by older disability organizations like the ARC and the Autism Society. These organizations are also working with groups like Little Lobbyists (https://www.littlelobbyists.org/)and other parent/family organizations who organized last year to protect Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. For those of us who are parents and working in the disability justice space, these alliances are proving to be interesting examples of not having to choose one group or the other. As someone who was 10 years old when the ADA became law, I have little memory of life before it, beyond what I've heard from my parents and elders in the community. The notion that I will need to start thinking about life without the ADA or with extremely limited access, paired with additional bureaucratic measures required to access public spaces, feels like I forgot to turn off Netflix before bed and an especially dark episode of "Black Mirror" is still playing in the background. This shouldn't be our reality.

In this light, what progress has been made?
