  More than 100 million people are expected to enter India 9s workforce by 2022, yet a lack of investment in education has put the South Asian nation in danger of wasting the demographic dividend that could fuel its economic growth. Thursday 9s budget was an opportunity to allocate more on education -- the most powerful instrument for reducing poverty and inequality in one of the youngest(http://www.skilldevelopment.gov.in/assets/images/Skill%20India/National%20Policy%20on%20Skill%20Development%20and%20Entreprenurship%20Final.pdf "Link to Website") nations in the world. But while Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced measures(http://www.indiabudget.gov.in/ub2018-19/bs/bs.pdf "Link to Website") to boost education infrastructure out to 2022, he was not that generous in allocating resources in the near term.     Slow Rise  Federal government education outlay increased by just 3.8% for FY19   Source: India Budget 2018   !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iG4e9JbTcQiE/v1/-1x-1.png)     India has made progress on access to schooling in recent years, although dropout rates and low levels of learning remain a key challenge. cWe have managed to get children to school but the quality of education is still a cause of serious concern, said Jaitley in his budget speech. cWe propose to increase the digital intensity in education and move gradually from 8black board 9 to 8digital board 9. Even though overall spending of state and federal governments has been increasing, as a percentage of GDP it 9s decreasing. Spending on education was 2.7 percent of GDP for the financial year 2018, down from 3.1 percent in FY13.     Spending Shortfall  India&apos;s share of GDP devoted to education remains low   Source: Economic Survey 2017-18  *The figures are of the public spending of federal government and states \r* FY17 and FY18 figures are provisional\r  !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i94e5Xcy0Y44/v1/-1x-1.png)  India 9s public education spend as a percentage of GDP is the lowest among its peers, according to BRICS Joint Statistical Publication(http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2017/JSP-2017.pdf "Link to Publication.") 2017.

India has implemented free compulsory education for children, spent more on infrastructure and made progress on enrollment, building class rooms, providing drinking water and toilets, and appointment of teachers. Yet girls continue to experience discrimination in accessing higher education.     Overcrowded Classrooms  Even as India&apos;s pupil-teacher ratio has increased, it still lags behind Asia average\r   Source: UNESCO\r  * Brazil, Japan, Russia and South Africa figures are of 2014\r  !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iq6BCgEiMqPM/v1/-1x-1.png)  One of the most worrying factors is the declining in quality of education. Students in India aged 14-18 years show a lack of basic skills despite spending years in school, according to ASER(http://img.asercentre.org/docs/Publications/ASER%20Reports/ASER%202017/beyondbasics4pagerenglish.pdf "Link to Website") Centre.     Training Failure  More than half of those aged 14-18 struggle with simple division   Source: Annual Status of Education Report 2017  * Based on assessment of 30,000 children in 28 districts of 24 states in India  !(https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQMLtbYrrifA/v1/-1x-1.png)     "Even though the government has increased the allocation for education sector, it 9s still below expectations," said Shuchi Gautam, associate professor at Thakur Institute of Management Studies and Research in Mumbai. "This budget is a moderate one with more focus on consolidation and strengthening of existing initiatives."
