 Explicitly articulating a tension and then examining it together, rather than continuing to debate the topic itself, can almost always help diminish or eliminate the strain. Many people feel frustrated and embattled against Trump and his supporters, and vice versa. But those who are frustrated only seem to speak to each other. If instead we each conversed with one person who didn't vote in the last election and persuaded him or her to vote, or we each talked to someone who voted differently than we did, and we managed to bridge the gap between us, we'd have a much better country and world. These dialogues alone would reach across the political divide. They could help probe, expose and dissolve false information and myths. We may each end up becoming more aware of our own assumptions and biases, altering our own views and finding new paths forward to bridge the chasm in ways that can benefit our nation as a whole. !Ethics of reporting on Trump&39;s mental fitness(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7) !Ethics of reporting on Trump&39;s mental fitness(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180106200316-16-week-in- politics-0107-large-169.jpg) !Ethics of reporting on Trump's mental fitness(//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180106200316-16-week-in- politics-0107-large-169.jpg)(javascript:void\(0\); "Click to watch this video")  JUST WATCHED  Ethics of reporting on Trump's mental fitness Replay More Videos ...(/videos)  MUST WATCH Ethics of reporting on Trump's mental fitness 06:20 If nothing else, we can help move our country away from its current paralyzing political polarization. It doesn't take much effort, and it can have powerful effects. Undoubtedly, we all have extended family members, co-workers, in- laws, high school and college friends, and acquaintances who, based on conversations in recent years, didn't vote or staunchly oppose our own views. We could each make a list of these individuals, and then decide which might be most amenable to a conversation. We could say to them: "I know we've disagreed at times in the past about how we look at the world, but I was wondering if we might be able to talk briefly, so we can understand each other better." We should offer to treat them for lunch, dinner, coffee or drinks. Once together, we could say, "I was wondering how you feel about what's happening to our country and world today. How do you think we can make the world a better place? What do you think the world will be like in 10 years? Twenty years? One-hundred years? What do you think the world should be like? How can we get there? What do you think the environment will be like in 20 years? What should it be like? How do you think we can help it?" Join us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/cnnopinion)and Facebook(http://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion) As we approach the 2018 election, billions of dollars(https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/cost.php) will no doubt be spent jamming swing state TV stations with nonstop political ads. But a free, grass- roots approach, as described here, can most help our teetering, troubled country and world. Some of the individuals we approach may be wary and refuse us. Or they may agree to talk but the dialogue proves unfruitful. Yet other conversations may lead to important reflections on these crucial questions. Two or three of us may need to speak with someone who didn't vote or voted differently than we did, to prompt reconsiderations of these issues. But we should all try. Even if only half of us succeed, we can, literally, change the world.
